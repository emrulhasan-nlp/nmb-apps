As Israel’s assault against Hamas in Gaza grinds on and the civilian death toll grows, there’s been growing international pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to end the campaign. Netanyahu has rejected those calls, vowing to destroy the Palestinian militant group that killed hundreds of Israelis in an October raid. On Jan. 11, South Africa’s government called upon the International Court of Justice, the main judicial body of the United Nations, to rule Israel’s actions in Gaza to be genocide and order Israel to withdraw its troops. In an interim ruling on Jan. 26, the ICJ told Israel it must act immediately to prevent the killing of innocent Palestinians, but rejected South Africa’s demand for a ceasefire.

South Africa alleged that Israel had violated its obligations under the United Nations Genocide Convention. It said Israel’s actions were “genocidal in character” as they aim to bring about the destruction of Gaza’s Palestinians. It called for an end to the fighting and said those responsible for Israel’s campaign should be put on trial. South Africa’s ruling African National Congress has historic ties and sympathies with the Palestinian cause, saying the issue mirrors its own struggle against apartheid rule.
