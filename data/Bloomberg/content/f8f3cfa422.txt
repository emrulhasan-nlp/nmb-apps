Maui Countyâ€™s failure to sound sirens to warn residents of the danger of a fire that engulfed Lahaina last month was blamed in a lawsuit for the death of a woman who was unable to escape.

The lawsuit is the first following the deadliest US fire in more than a century to target county and state governments over the emergency response effort, according to lawyers who filed the complaint Monday in Hawaii state court.
