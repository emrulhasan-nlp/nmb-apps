00:13 >> OF COURSE THE EQUITY MARKET’S BEEN LARGELY DRIVEN BY

00:16 THE TECH STOCK.

00:18 >> TELLING YOU THAT THE RECESSION SHOULD BE STARTING.

00:22 >> I THINK IT’S A WARNING THAT SOME OF THE THINGS BECOMING

00:24 LESS.

00:26 >> WE’RE NOT SUPER RESTRICTIVE.

00:35 >> THE ECHOS AND THE RAMIFICATIONS.

01:12 >> I LOVE WHAT RYAN BEAM WRITES UP.

01:19 FOR EVERY APPLE, MICROSOFT, TEXT REPORTING AND ALL THAT,

01:22 COMPANIES ARE STRUGGLING AND THEY NEED TO RESET.

01:30 JONATHAN: LET'S TALK ABOUT EUROPE.

01:35 WE TALK ABOUT THE FED HIKING IN THE LABOR MARKET.

01:41 EUROPE, 42 AND MANUFACTURING PMI.

01:52 THAT IS CONTRACTUALLY.

01:59 TOM: IN MIDDLE OF THE SUMMER, A COMBINATION OF THE BLENDED PI.

02:12 ON FRANCE IN GERMANY, THAT TO ME IS THE LEAD STORY. JONATHAN:

02:19 ON CHINA CAN WE HAVE A BAILOUT AND GET SOME STIMULUS.

02:24 THE TOP DECISION-MAKING BODY FILING TO STRENGTHEN TOM:

02:29 DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION TOM:. -- STRENGTHEN DOMESTIC

02:33 CONSUMPTION. TOM: IS THERE SOMETHING NEW HERE?

02:41 THIS IS THE MODEL OF TOTALITARIAN REGIME. JONATHAN:

02:46 DID YOU WATCH ANY OF THE MOVIES OVER THE WEEKEND, BARBIE AND

02:50 OPPENHEIMER? TOM:

02:56 I'M GOING TO WATCH TOP GUN BEFORE I SEE BARBIE.

03:05 THE OFFSPRING SAW IT AND SAID IT WAS NICE BUT SHE WAS IN LOVE

03:08 WITH BARBIE, SHE SAID IT WAS MORE OF A STATEMENT.

03:21 WHEN PUTIN WORKED UNDER OPPENHEIMER WAS NOT THRILLED BY

03:22 OPPENHEIMER. WE WILL SEE IT SECOND OR THIRD

03:29 OR FOURTH TIME. WE USED TO DO THAT. JONATHAN:

03:35 LET'S TURN TO PRICE ACTION IN THE EQUITY MARKET.

03:45 A MAJOR WEEK OF CENTRAL BANKING DECISIONS.

03:51 YIELDS RIGHT NOW DOWN TO BASIS POINTS.

04:01 EURO WEAKNESS, HAVING DOWN FOR ANOTHER DATE, -- ANOTHER DAY.

04:10 TOM: THE KEY METRIC IS THE IDEA OF A

04:12 SWITZERLAND ASCENDANT. YOU LOOK AT THE EURO AS

04:17 COMPARED TO SWISS. I KNOW IT IS MEANINGLESS TO

04:23 MOST PEOPLE BUT THE SUM TOTAL OF WHAT I AM WATCHING IS WHAT

04:28 YOU AND I WATCHED I FIRST MET YOU. JONATHAN:

04:35 I THINK YOU'D FORGET WHEN WE FIRST MET BUT OK.

04:43 WEDNESDAY, THE FEDERAL RESERVE, ECB THURSDAY, FRIDAY THE BOJ.

04:48 ALPHABET, GOOGLE COMING ON TUESDAY.

04:55 META WEDNESDAY AND AMAZON THURSDAY.

05:00 NEXT THURSDAY IS WE HEAR FROM THE BANK OF ENGLAND. TOM:

05:09 BEING -- THE BIG THING IS AMAZON AND HOW IT IS DOING.

05:14 JONATHAN: YOU HAVE HEARD THE COMPLAINTS,

05:18 DO WE NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THAT?

05:23 >> I THINK WE WILL GET A LOT OF CLARITY THIS WEEK.

05:29 THE FED AND ECB, NOT MUCH FURTHER TO GO.

05:34 IT WILL KEEP VALUATIONS HIGH.

05:44 THE S&P 500 REPORTING, EARNINGS, AND A BIT OF NO MAN'S

05:46 LAND.

05:47 ROSE OUT OF TECH GIVING US ENOUGH TO GET THROUGH THE

06:01 SUMMER.

06:03 TOM: YOU GO RIGHT TO THE HEART OF

06:08 THE SEVENTH STOCKS AND I WANT TO FOCUS ON THE FACT THAT HE

06:12 HAS NAILED THIS FOR THREE YEARS. YOU TALK ABOUT A HIGH EMERGENT

06:17 TECH SECTOR. THE RETAIL PUBLIC AGREES,

06:22 INSTITUTIONS ARE FAR MORE CAUTIOUS ACCORDING TO REPORTS

06:26 WE SEE FROM BLOOMBERG MARKETS. WHO IS RIGHT, THE INSTITUTIONS

06:29 OR RETAIL IN LOVE WITH APPLE?

06:35 BEN: NEVER GIVE UP ON THE MARKET,

06:38 WHETHER IT IS TECH OR CRYPTO.

06:46 TOP OF THE FED CYCLE, INFLATION COMING DOWN, EARNING CYCLE

06:50 ABOUT TO TURN OUT, A BIG TECHNICAL OVERLAY, THE MORE

06:55 WORK IT GOES HIGHER THE MORE THE INSTITUTIONAL MANAGING,

07:01 ULTIMATELY GET PAID TO MANAGE MONEY.

07:05 FUNDAMENTALS ARE INCREASINGLY VALIDATING IT.

07:12 THE MONEY WILL HAVE TO STEP UP. TOM:

07:19 YOU MAILED THIS, I BELIEVE CHRISTMAS 2018.

07:22 I CAN'T REMEMBER RIGHT NOW BUT THE ANSWER IS, IT IS JULY, WHEN

07:31 DOES THE PRESSURE KICK IN ON 12 MONTHS PERFORMANCE?

07:33 DOES IT HAPPEN NOW OR? AFTER AMERICAN LABOR DAY?

07:42 CASH DOES HAPPEN NOW OR -- DOES IT HAPPEN NOW OR AFTER AMERICAN

07:43 LABOR DAY? BEN: NEXT YEAR WILL BE A FANTASTIC

07:48 YEAR. WE START TO DISCOUNT SOME OF

07:51 THAT. MAYBE IT COMES EARLY.

08:03 THE MASSIVE RALLY WE HAVE HAD GIVEN SOME WEEKS.

08:10 THE MARKET NOW WANTS TO GO FOR STEP FURTHER INTO CYCLICALS.

08:16 WE HAVE HAD 10 DAYS OF DOUBT RAILING AND WILL TELL YOU WHAT

08:22 THEY ARE THINKING AND MAYBE LOOKING AT THE NEXT ONE.

08:27 JONATHAN: YOU SAID CONFIDENTLY THAT NEXT

08:30 YEAR WAS GOING TO BE A GOOD YEAR.

08:31 WHAT IS BEHIND THAT CONVICTION? BEN: WE ARE LOOKING TO A GREAT

08:37 ACCELERATION OF EARNINGS.

08:44 JANUARY WE DOUBLE DIGIT EARNINGS.

08:53 WE WILL START TO SEE THE PROFIT MARGINS.

08:57 WE DON'T TALK ABOUT RELIEF FROM PROFIT MARGINS.

09:03 WILL BE CLOSE TO THE FED CUTTING INTEREST RATES.

09:10 THAT WILL KEEP VALUATIONS HIGH.

09:16 IT IS FULL OF TECH, HAIR CARE AND THESE ARE SENSITIVE TO

09:21 YIELDS AND THE FED CUTTING RATES. RITIKA: -- JONATHAN:

09:27 WHY WOULD THE FED CUT RATES? BEN:

09:34 WE HAVE HEADLINE INFLATION OF 3%.

09:37 WHAT WE WILL SEE TWO MORE INFLATION PRINTS BEFORE THE FED

09:43 MEETING. I THINK YOU'LL SEE THE HEADLINE

09:48 NUMBERS COME DOWN FURTHER.

09:57 I STILL THINK MOST OF THE GROWTH SLOWDOWN IS STILL TO

09:59 COME.

10:07 YOU HIGHLIGHTED THE SLOWDOWN WHICH IS COMING.

10:17 IT IS ENOUGH TO KEEP YOU IN THE DEFENSIVE AREAS AND AWAY FROM

10:19 CYCLICALS.

10:25 JONATHAN: OUTDOES EARNINGS GROWTH WE

10:29 ACCELERATE IF WE SEE DISINFLATION AND SLOWER

10:34 ECONOMIC GROWTH? BEN:

10:37 ONCE WE GET THROUGH INTO THE BEGINNING OF NEXT YEAR, WE WILL

10:44 GET A BIT MORE STIMULUS OUT OF CHINA. I DO THINK THE U.S.

10:51 CONSUMER WITH THE LABOR MARKET WILL SOFTEN OUT.

11:02 I THINK LOWER INFLATION AND ALSO GIVING POWER BACK. TOM:

11:09 YOU HAVE LIVED THE STRATEGIST OR'S AND I SAY THIS WITH

11:12 IMMENSE RESPECT FOR HIS MAGNIFICENT AND LONELY CALL AT

11:15 THE END OF 2018. WHAT IS THE PRESSURE THE MAJOR

11:29 HOUSES AND BANKS THAT PEOPLE ARE CONVINCED IT IS BEARS?

11:36 BEN: IT IS FORWARD LOOKING. WE ARE LOOKING TO THE FED

11:40 CUTTING INTEREST RATES.

11:47 WE WILL GET A GLIMMER OF HOPE WHEN EARNINGS COME UP FROM THE

11:48 GIANTS. VERY TECH HEAVY, THE OPPOSITE

11:54 OF WHAT WE SEE IN THE STOCK MARKET.

11:59 A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE MISSED THE RALLY.

12:05 UNLESS THE BANKS DRAMATICALLY CHANGED WHICH THEY HAVEN'T,

12:09 PEOPLE WILL GRADUALLY GET DRAGGED INTO THE RALLY BECAUSE

12:11 THEY HAVE TO. I THINK THE FUNDAMENTALS WILL

12:17 INCREMENTALLY GET WORSE AND THEN TURN POSITIVE.

12:24 JONATHAN:

12:33 AND CONSTRUCTIVE CALL FROM BEN LAIDLER.

12:37 CENTRAL-BANK DECISION WORTH REPEATING, FEDERAL BANK AND THE

12:40 BOJ ON FRIDAY. ECB COMING UP THURSDAY.

12:48 TOM: I WILL LEAN ON YOU ON THIS BUT

12:55 THE ECB'S WINNER INCHED AND THEN THE FED HERE.

13:00 I THINK ANNMARIE HORDERN DID GREAT JOB LAST WEEK.

13:02 UKRAINE IS NOT A SMALL MATTER. THERE IS A WAR GOING ON IN

13:08 UKRAINE INTO THE CREDIT OF LUMBER AND OTHER NEWS

13:11 ORGANIZATIONS, THEY ARE KEEPING IT FRONT AND CENTER BUT I DON'T

13:16 SEE IT VISIBLY IN THE MINDS OF INVESTORS OR THE AMERICAN

13:17 PUBLIC IN GENERAL. IT IS OUT THERE.

13:25 JONATHAN: WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT WHAT IS

13:31 HAPPENING WITH WHEAT AND HOW CONCERNED THE NATION SHOULD BE.

13:38 TOM: IT IS ABOUT MEDITERRANEAN DYNAMICS COMING OUT OF THE

13:43 BLACK SEA INTO THE EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN.

13:50 EVEN OVERNIGHT, THERE WAS UNREST IN THE BLACK SEA.

14:13 MY ONE BAG FOR THE AMERICAN NETWORKS IS THE BRITISH

14:14 ANNOUNCERS ARE SO MUCH BETTER. THEY ARE LOOKING AT THE

14:19 PITSTOP, 1.9 SECONDS.

14:25 IF THE AMERICANS WERE DOING

14:47 >> ALL THREE ARE GOING TO HYPE BY 25 BASIS POINTS, BUT THAT IS

14:51 WHERE THE COMMONALITY WILL END. I THINK THE FED WILL COME

14:57 ACROSS AS DOVISH, THE BACK OF GOOD WILL BE HAWKISH IN THE ECB

15:00 WILL BE IN THE MIDDLE IN TERMS OF THE POLICY GUIDANCE.

15:05 JONATHAN:

15:14 THAT IS MOHAMMED AL ERIAN ABOUT THE BANKING.

15:20 ON THE S&P 500, 40% OF THE MARKET CAP THIS S&P 500

15:24 REPORTING EARNINGS THIS WEEK ALONE.

15:25 A MONSTER WEEK OF EARNINGS SEASON THIS WEEK.

15:29 YIELDS LOWER BY THREE BASIS POINTS. 55 ON THE U.S. 10 YEAR.

15:38 DOWNSIDE SURPRISE UNDATED IN THE U.K.

15:43 AND PMI 9:00 FOR THE U.S. TOM:

15:52 THE DATA COMING IN AROUND JOBS DAY IN AUGUST. THE WHOLE THING

15:55 IS ABOUT THE INFLATION REPORT. THAT IS THE NEXT BIG REPORT OUT.

16:03 JONATHAN: ULTIMATELY, IT WAS NEVER ABOUT

16:08 THE DECISION FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE.

16:09 IT WAS SEPTEMBER AND BEYOND.

16:15 TOM: IT FEELS LIKE A MONDAY MORNING

16:23 IN LATE JULY AT FOUR POLICY STRATEGISTS.

16:29 IN THE OLD DAYS IT WAS ABOUT A UNION AMERICA.

16:33 I KNOW THAT HAS CHANGED, BUT IT HASN'T.

16:43 WHAT I FIND FASCINATING IS ALL

16:49 THE STEREOTYPES, BIDEN OF THE AFL-CIO IS SUPPOSED TO BE WE

16:51 GET A PRO UNION. IS THIS PRESIDENT WE COULD?

17:00 GREG: UNION LEADERS WANT HIM TO BUT

17:01 OUT.

17:07 THEY HAD A RADICAL TALKING GUY AT THE TEAMSTERS WHO SAID WE

17:11 DON'T WANT YOU INVOLVED. THIS WEEK AND NO THE FED IS A

17:19 BIG STORY BUT THIS WEEK IS A BIG STORY FOR THE CONTRACT OR

17:23 WILL THEY COME BACK ON TUESDAY,

17:29 EVEN AS THEY AGREED ON A DEAL WEDNESDAY WILL THEY GET A DEAL

17:30 DONE? AT LEAST THEY WILL HAVE A

17:36 STRIKE AND THAT WILL BE THE BEST SCENARIO. TOM:

17:41 HOW DOES UPS EXPAND IF WE ARE NONUNION AMERICA? GREG:

17:46 THEY WANT TO BRING IN PART-TIME WORKERS. AND YOU HAVE COPYCATS.

17:52 YOU HAVE THE UNITED AUTO WORKERS INDICATING MAY -- THEY

17:57 MAY GO ON STRIKE. A BIG DEAL FOR JOE BIDEN AND I

18:03 WOULD ARGUE A BIG DEAL FOR THE FED. COULD THIS PRECLUDE THE FED

18:11 FROM ANOTHER MOVE AFTER THIS WEEKS HIKE, THEY MAY HAVE TO

18:14 WAIT IF THERE IS A STRIKE AT UPS. JONATHAN:

18:20 ARE YOU UNDER THE IMPRESSION THIS PRESIDENT WOULD STAY OUT

18:23 OF THE NEGOTIATIONS IF THAT HAPPENED? GREG:

18:28 AT LEAST FOR A WHILE. HE DIDN'T STAY OUT EARLIER ON

18:32 RAILROADS BUT HE WILL BUT OUT IF THE UNION SAYS TO BUT OUT.

18:37 IF THE STRIKE DRAGS ON AND WE TALK ABOUT THE PLAY CHAIN

18:42 ISSUES IN THE HOLIDAYS, YOU HAD TO BE UNDER PRESSURE TO CALL

18:43 THEM BACK TO WORK. JONATHAN: IT IS THE PROBLEM THAT WON'T GO

18:50 AWAY, THE BUSINESS DEALINGS OF

18:56 HIS SON AND THEN VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. GREG:

19:02 IT IS QUITE A STORY TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY WOULD BRING IN

19:06 JOE BIDEN IN CONVERSATIONS TO CLOSE A DEAL.

19:18 WHAT IT PARTICIPANTS WILL TESTIFY.

19:20 I THINK HE WILL BE IMPEACHED OVER IT BUT CERTAINLY THE

19:21 SENATE WOULD NEVER CONVICT. DONALD TRUMP CAN SAY I AM BEING

19:27 PERSECUTED AGGRESSIVELY AND DONALD TRUMP -- JOE BIDEN ISN'T.

19:32 JONATHAN: RON DESANTIS, THE GOVERNOR OF

19:36 FLORIDA, DROPPING TO THIRD PLACE.

19:42 WE UNDERSTAND NIKKI HALEY'S ROUTES IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND

19:44 LIKEWISE WITH TIM SCOTT. HOW WAS HIS CAMPAIGN OVER THE

19:47 WEEKEND? GREG:

19:55 HE IS STILL IN FREEFALL AND HIS COMMENT ABOUT SLAVERY OVER THE

19:57 WEEKEND DIDN'T HELP. IT WAS SHOCKING.

20:04 I THINK THE BIG SIOUX IS -- BIG ISSUE IS WHO BECOMES THE SECOND.

20:11 ABOUT TIM SCOTT? HE COULD BECOME THE SLEEPER

20:14 OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS. TOM:

20:20 THE DEBATES ARE UPON US, WHAT IS AFTER THE DEBATE?

20:25 ARE YOU LOOK AT IT AS A CONTINUUM OF DEBATES TO A

20:29 PRIMARY VOTE OR IS IT NEW POLITICS? GREG:

20:33 THERE WILL BE A LOT OF FUNDRAISING AND FOCUS ON THAT.

20:39 THERE WILL BE A LOT OF SPECULATION.

20:40 COULD THERE BE ANOTHER CANDIDATE WHO COULD ANNOUNCE

20:42 LATE THIS YEAR? I SAY YES.

20:49 I THINK THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, GLENN YOUNGKIN, IS

20:51 STILL A REAL POSSIBILITY.

20:59 TOM: I SEE ALL THESE CANDIDATES THEY

21:05 ARE OUT LOOKING FOR FUNDRAISING. IS THERE A VALUE TO FUNDRAISING

21:15 TO X. GREG:

21:25 WHAT DO YOU MEAN X. TOM: ELON MUSK WAS TALKING ABOUT

21:31 CHANGING THE NAME OF TWITTER TO X. IS THERE VALUE?

21:39 GREG: VERY MINIMAL. JONATHAN:

21:45 WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?

21:54 AND THEN WE HEAR ABOUT A GRAND PLAN FOR X.

22:02 YOU SEE THE CEO HAVING THE AUTHORITY? TOM:

22:06 THE ANSWER IS IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN.

22:10 A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH RESPECT FOR HER CAREER AT NBC IN THE

22:18 HOLISTIC ABILITY OF RAISING MONEY CONSISTENTLY ARE CUTTING

22:24 MAJOR SLACK BUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN IT.

22:30 JONATHAN: I THINK THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT IN SOUTH CAROLINA.

22:37 IT GOES TO THE TOP DECISIONS WHEN DECIDING THE CHOICE FOR

22:40 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION. ECONOMIC ISSUES ARE AT 1%.

22:46 THAT IS A PROBLEM FOR THE GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA WHO HAS

22:49 MADE SOCIAL ISSUES A BIG DEAL.

23:03 TOM:

23:09 DONOVAN WILL BRING A CONSTRUCTIVE INTO THE AMERICAN

23:13 POLITICS.

23:19 JONATHAN: ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THE

23:20 ELECTIONS IN THE U.K.? TOM:

23:24 THE GREEN LEFTIST AT HAMBURG IN OXBRIDGE BECAUSE IT IS GREEN

23:30 POLICY IN LONDON.

23:32 IT WILL AMEND THE GREEN PARTY. JONATHAN:

23:37 SHIFT TO THE RIGHT THERE AND YOU ALSO SEE IT IN SPAIN.

23:44 TOM: DOES IT MEAN FOR REAL HUNDRED?

23:51 JONATHAN: COMING UP, A BIG WEEK AHEAD.

23:57 EARNINGS.

24:16 JONATHAN: 40% OF THE S&P 500 REPORTING

24:18 EARNINGS THIS WEEK. TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY,

24:21 BIG TECH NAMES.

24:29 THE EQUITY MARKET ON THE S&P 500, FIRMER BY TWO POINTS, ON

24:31 THE NASDAQ BY .3%. APPLE SLIGHTLY POSITIVE.

24:38 AND REPORTING MOMENTS AGO, APPLE ASKING SUPPLIERS TO

24:43 PRODUCE 85 UNITS -- 85 MILLION UNITS OF THE IPHONE.

24:50 THE KEY POINT IS THEY ARE LIKELY TO INCREASE REVENUE

24:54 BECAUSE APPLE IS CONSIDERING RAISING THE PRICE OF THE PRO

24:57 MODEL. ULTIMATELY REVENUE PER UNIT

25:01 FIRE.

25:07 TOM: IT IS $3 TRILLION LEVEL.

25:15 IT IS PRICED FOR THE CASH FLOW, HUGE PROFITABILITY.

25:19 THE DIVIDEND PAYOUT 14.3%. IPHONE IS THE COMPANY.

25:33 I WOULD ASSUME THE BULLS ARE SUGGESTING THAT ALL THAT IS

25:36 NEEDED IS THE STABILITY AND ANOTHER CYCLE OF GETTING IT

25:37 DONE.

25:43 I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IPHONE THIS IS OR WHAT THE NEW ONE IS

25:45 BUT WHAT IS? GOING TO BE THE DIFFERENCE?

25:50 -- BUT WHAT IS GOING TO BE THE DIFFERENCE? JONATHAN:

25:54 THE PRICE POINT APPARENTLY. TOM: WHO IS PAYING 100.

26:02 JONATHAN: I FINALLY PAID THIS ONE OFF.

26:14 THE STOCK IS POSITIVE BY 0.6 PERCENT.

26:16 APPLE REPORTS NEXT THURSDAY. TOM:

26:22 SO AFTER THURSDAY WE HAVE 70% OF THE S&P 500. JONATHAN:

26:30 THE TWO YEAR YIELD PUSHING HIGHER OFF THE BACK OF BETTER

26:32 THAN EXPECTED JOBLESS CLAIMS DATA.

26:40 A 10 YEAR, DOWN THREE BASIS POINTS.

26:45 IT IS A RALLY IN THE BOND MARKET BACK FROM AWFUL DATA IN

26:48 EUROPE. THE EURO NEGATIVE AGAINST THE

26:52 DOLLAR.

27:01 EURO-DOLLAR LOOKING AT WHEN 10.82.

27:08 TOM: IS YOU OUT OF LONDON WHERE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE IS

27:11 SUPREME. BUT THE BASIC IDEA IS STREET

27:14 CALL IS WEAKER DOLLAR. USUALLY WHATEVER IT IS

27:18 CONFOUNDS THE STREET CALL. AT LEAST THAT MEANS DOLLAR

27:22 STABILITY. JONATHAN: THE DATA GOING AGAINST THAT

27:26 CALL. CHINA'S COMMON PARTY PLENTY NEW

27:31 STEPS TO BOOST THE ECONOMY. A MEETING REPORTEDLY UNDERWAY.

27:37 HEADLINES FOR THE CHINESE MEDIA, THE PARTY WILL BOOST

27:41 DOMESTIC DEMAND AND LOOK TO RESOLVE LOCAL DEBT RISK AND

27:45 ADJUST PROPERTY POLICIES. THERE IS A LOT THEY HAVE TO DO

27:47 IN CHINA.

27:53 TALK ABOUT THE WEAK DOLLAR AND THAT MATERIALIZED IN A BIGGER

27:56 WAY IF CHINA COMES OUT WITH A MASSIVE STIMULUS PACKAGE. TOM:

28:02 THEY HAVE THE REGISTERED UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE WEST AND

28:05 THE INSERT IS IT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN WHAT JANET

28:08 YELLEN THINK IN WASHINGTON AND THE ANSWER IS THIS IS DOMESTIC

28:13 POLICY WRAPPED AROUND GETTING PEOPLE JOBS.

28:15 CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT MEETING OF ALL OF THESE PEOPLE.

28:25 THE ANSWER IS THE PRESIDENT XI IS THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE.

28:29 WHAT WE NEED IS IMPLEMENT ACROSS THERE. JONATHAN:

28:35 EUROPEAN POLICY MAKERS WATCHING CLOSELY.

28:42 PMI DROPPING TO THE LOWEST READING GOING BACK TO NOVEMBER.

28:47 IT IS SERVICES MANUFACTURING LOWER-THAN-EXPECTED. TOM:

28:52 WE HAVE TO GO FROM BUDAPEST TO BELGIUM FOR THE F1 RACE AND

28:56 THEN YOU TAKE A MONTH OFF BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT YOU DO IN

29:01 EUROPE AND THEN THE ITALIAN RACE IN SEPTEMBER.

29:07 THE KEY OBSERVATION LINKING F1 IN BECAUSE WE HAVE TO TAKE A

29:08 MONTH OFF. YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOTELS I AM.

29:15 JONATHAN: I THINK IT IS A GREAT THING.

29:19 YOU TAKE THE MONTH OFF AND GO TO THE MOVIE THEATER.

29:24 OPPENHEIMER SMASHING EXPECTATIONS.

29:27 I'M MAY WATCH OPPENHEIMER THIS WEEKEND.

29:35 BARBIE BRINGING IN 55 MILLION. THESE WERE THE ESTIMATES THAT

29:37 CAME OUT SUNDAY. OPPENHEIMER BRING IN $80

29:39 MILLION. TO HAVE A TRIPLE DIGIT NUMBER

29:45 LIKE 55 MILLION OVER BARBIE AND STILL SEE ANOTHER NAME AND

29:51 MOVIE DELIVERING $80 MILLION, THAT IS PRETTY RARE.

29:56 YOU DON'T SEE STUFF LIKE THAT. TOM:

30:04 IT COVERS UP A LOT OF FLOPS THIS YEAR.

30:08 WHAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT, IMAGINE WHAT THE NUMBERS WOULD

30:10 HAVE BEEN IN THE OLDER TIME AND PLACE.

30:15 BARBIE WOULD HAVE POPPED 250 MILLION. JONATHAN:

30:19 IN PRE-STREAMING WORLD. TOM: I HAVE DEAL WITH SWEENEY

30:25 EVERYDAY AT 9:00 WHO IS EXCELLENT AND PAUL SWEENEY'S

30:28 ROLE IS A JUMBLE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF

30:29 THIS. JONATHAN: GOOD NEWS FOR WARNER BROS..

30:36 MUCH-NEEDED. TOM:

30:42 NO I'M NOT GOING TO SEE BARBIE OR OPPENHEIMER.

30:52 I WANT YOU TO IN THE IMPACT OF CHINA WHEN YOU ARE LEADING

30:54 COVERAGE THERE. YOU HAVE AMERICA WITH A

31:01 STUNNING REAL GDP OF 3%. I WILL CALL YOU AN OUTLIER

31:04 RIGHT NOW. THAT TELLS ME CHINA IT IS NOT

31:07 SLOWING DOWN AMERICA?

31:14 IAN: ALMOST HALF OF THAT IS INVENTORY.

31:18 IT IS NOT SUSTAINABLE. I THINK WE GET A MUCH WEAKER

31:23 PROFILE IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.

31:29 THE IDEA THAT THE 3% HEADLINE IS INDICATIVE OF THE TREND IS

31:34 QUITE MISLEADING. WE ARE GETTING NOTHING OUT OF

31:36 CHINA. CHINA COVERING STORY HAS DONE

31:41 NOTHING. IT WAS PROBABLY SMALL DRAG.

31:53 EVERYBODY WAS EXCITED ABOUT THE POST CHINA COVID STORY

31:55 ABSOLUTELY HAS NOTHING.

31:59 THAT IS WHY WE ARE SEEING NOTHING IN ASIAN AND EUROPEAN

32:13 TRADE. TOM:

32:15 GLOBAL WALL STREET TUNING IN AND YOU ASCRIBE TO THE GLOBAL

32:21 SLOWDOWN THE AND OTHERS ARE TALKING ABOUT? IAN:

32:27 LOOKS LIKE EUROPEAN GROWTH HAS FLATTENED OUT. THE U.K.

32:30 PMI IS TERRIBLE AS WELL.

32:37 I THINK THE TALK OF A FEW WEEKS AGO OF 6.5% IS OFF OF THE

32:39 MARKET. THE ECB IS LIKELY TO RAISE.

32:50 IN THE U.S., THE Q2 READING WILL BE MISLEADING.

32:53 THE RESTARTING OF THE STUDENT LOAN PAYMENTS IN OCTOBER WILL

32:57 DAMPEN U.S. CONSUMPTION IN THE RUN-UP TO

33:01 THE HOLIDAYS. IT WILL SEE INVESTMENT IN THE

33:03 SECOND QUARTER IN THE U.S. HIGHER.

33:07 I AM ON BOARD WITH THE IDEA THAT THE REAL GROWTH IT SURE IS

33:12 NOT GOOD EVERYWHERE. WE ARE JUST NOT SEEING IT.

33:20 IT IS NOT CATASTROPHIC OR RECESSION TERRITORY BUT YOU

33:21 COULD GET THERE. IT IS IMPLAUSIBLE TO THINK

33:27 THERE COULD BE AN ABSOLUTE RECESSION IN THE SECOND HALF OF

33:29 THE YEAR AND I AM NOT RULING IT OUT.

33:35 3% Q2 DOES IT TELL US ANYTHING ABOUT WHERE WE WILL BE IN Q3 OR

33:36 Q4. JONATHAN:

33:43 MY QUESTION WOULD BE, WHAT IS THE LESSON FROM EUROPE AT THE

33:47 MOMENT WITH THE ECONOMY ON THE BRINK OF RECESSION AND

33:48 INFLATION STILL A PROBLEM? IAN: INFLATION WILL BE LESS OF A

33:55 PROBLEM IN EUROPE IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.

33:59 THE BIG THEME OF THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR EVERYWHERE IS

34:06 GOING TO BE MUCH LOWER INFLATION,.

34:11 HEADLINE IS HELPED BY THE ENERGY STORY BUT ALSO IN COURT

34:15 NUMBERS WITH LABOR MARKETS AND GROWTH MODERATING.

34:26 ALL THE FORCES COMING THROUGH TOGETHER, A CRAZY COUPLE OF

34:29 YEARS DURING THE PANDEMIC AND MUCH LOWER INFLATION

34:30 ENVIRONMENT.

34:37 JONATHAN: I REMEMBER HAVING THE SAME

34:43 CONVERSATION WITH YOU THIS TIME LAST YEAR AND IT DIDN'T,.

34:46 WHAT HAS CHANGED THAT YOU DIDN'T ANTICIPATE? IAN:

34:51 THE STICKINESS IN THE LABOR MARKET WAS A SURPRISE.

34:58 VERY STRONG WAGE GROWTH IN THE U.K.. THE LABOR MARKET IS NOT

35:03 SOFTENING.

35:09 YOU LOOK AT THE TREND AND THE DONALD -- DOWN TREND IS THERE.

35:18 THE WAGES OF WILL OVER IN THE LAST MONTH.

35:22 IT HAS BEEN VERY FRUSTRATING IS HASN'T HAPPENED SOONER.

35:27 THE UNDERWEIGHT NUMBERS HAVE ROLLED OVER AND IT IS LIKELY

35:28 THEY CONTINUE.

35:36 IN THE U.K., IT WILL WORK OUT IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.

35:40 WE DON'T HAVE GOOD UP-TO-DATE WAGE DATA IN EUROPE.

35:48 IT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE, THE SERVICES INFLATION IS WHERE THE

35:51 PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN BECAUSE LABOR IS SUCH A BIG PART OF THE

35:55 TOTAL BUNDLE FOR BUSINESSES. TOM:

36:02 WE WILL ASK, DO YOU SEE A FED THAT IS ABLE TO RHETORICALLY

36:07 CUT INTEREST RATES AND CUT INTEREST RATES OR IS IT EASIER

36:08 TO HOLD THE LINE? IAN:

36:15 FOR NOW THEY WILL STICK TO THE LINE THEY THINK THEY HAVE MORE

36:17 TO DO POTENTIALLY. IT IS TOO SOON TO EXPECT THEM

36:20 TO DECLARE VICTORY. HAD COURT CPI AND PAYROLL

36:24 NUMBERS. IT IS NOT ENOUGH.

36:31 I WOULD EXPECT CHAIRMAN POWELL TO RETAIN THE POTENTIAL TO GO

36:33 AGAIN IN SEPTEMBER. WHEN PUSH COMES TO SHOVE, MY

36:38 GUESS IS THEY WON'T GO IN SEPTEMBER.

36:43 A LOT OF INFORMATION COMING OUT BETWEEN NOW AND SEPTEMBER AND

36:46 MOST WILL BE CONSISTENT WITH THE IDEA THAT INFLATION IS THE

36:51 UPSWING.

36:57 WHY THAT ON THE LINE? I THINK THAT WILL BE MUCH MORE

37:02 CAUTIOUS AND RETAIN THE OPTIONALITY OF THE DATA.

37:08 THAT ALSO MEANS THEY ARE IN A POSITION WHERE THEY CAN SAY IN

37:12 SEPTEMBER, WE CAN EXTEND THE PAUSE THAT SEEMS PERFECTLY

37:15 REASONABLE TO ME. THE DOVES ARE GOING TO BE

37:20 DISAPPOINTED. TOM:

37:35 SPEAKING OF THE DOVES, THE MAGPIES THE TWO TOUGHEST TEAMS

37:40 IN SOCCER.

37:41 JONATHAN: WHAT WOULD SUCCESS LOOK LIKE?

37:45 IAN: IN OUT OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP IN

37:50 THE FIRST STAGE AND QUALIFYING FOR NEXT YEAR. JONATHAN:

37:56 THERE WE GO.

38:06 HE HAD A SEASON TICKET BUT HE GAVE IT UP AT NEWCASTLE.

38:08 HE WAS UNIMPRESSED WITH READERSHIP.

38:15 DID YOU HAVE SEATS THERE ONCE UPON A TIME? TOM: I DID.

38:23 I SAT WITH STEVEN KEAN.

38:48 >> WE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING DEFLATION FOR DECADES.

38:57 ECB, I THINK IT CAN GET HIGHER THAN THE DOLLAR. JONATHAN:

39:03 PUSHING BACK AGAINST THE WEAKER DOLLAR CALL.

39:09 WELLS FARGO ERIC NELSON DOING THE SAME THING.

39:12 YOU NEED TO SEEK STRONGER GROWTH WORLDWIDE.

39:17 YOU NEED TO SEE A BIG TO ME EFFORT OUT OF CHINA AND THERE

39:20 IS PLENTY OF TALK ABOUT THAT BUT NO ACTION.

39:24 THE DATA, EUROZONE AND U.K. DOES NOT BACK UP THAT THIS

39:29 ECONOMY IS RIPROARING. TOM: YOU SAY WHAT WAS THE

39:34 INTERESTING STOP THE SHOW POINT OVER THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS.

39:40 IT WAS THE IMF FIVE YEARS SLOW GROWTH PROJECTION FOR GLOBAL

39:41 GROWTH. TO BE FAIR, IT MONTHS COME IT

39:46 IS HAPPENING IN REAL TIME.

39:53 JONATHAN: FIVE DAYS OF EURO WEAKNESS,

40:01 FOLLOWING THE BIGGEST WEEK SINCE MAY. TOM:

40:08 AND OTIS THE MEXICAN PESO, 16.9. SOMETHING AMERICANS ARE WE

40:14 FROM, THERE ARE COMMODITIES, AND JUST FOIL.

40:18 THINK COPPER, IRON OR. AND THEN THERE ARE THE SOFTS.

40:24 YOU CAN GET ON TREND, MAKE MONEY, LOSE MONEY, HEDGE,

40:29 COFFEE, COCOA, LIVESTOCK, SUGAR, WHEAT.

40:39 WHEAT IN THE NEWS THE FIRST PRINCIPLES, IS THERE

40:42 A GLOBAL PRICE TO WHEAT LIKE THERE IS A GLOBAL PRICE TO

40:47 BRENT CRUDE?

40:54 >> THAT IS PROBABLY A GLOBAL BENCHMARK.

40:57 EQUITY FUTURES IN EUROPE FOR PARIS. TOM:

41:05 IS WHEAT A SINGULAR NEWS ITEM ON UKRAINE, BLACK SEA AND SUCH

41:08 OR DOES IT LINK INTO THE OTHER SOFT COMMODITIES?

41:14 >> RIGHT NOW WE SHOULD ALL BE TALKING ABOUT WHEAT.

41:20 WE HAVE ONE OF THE LARGEST WEEK SUPPLIES CUT OFF.

41:26 THEY HAVE IT BUT THEY DON'T HOW TO GET IT OUT OF THE COUNTRY.

41:34 GREENS BEING BLOCKED IN THE BLACK SEA.

41:39 THE ESCALATION OF FIGHTING AND FEWER CHIPS COMING INTO THE

41:45 PORT, ALL OF THIS MAKES IT HARD FOR ANY SHIPMENTS COMING OUT OF

41:47 THAT REGION.

41:56 HIGHER IN TERMS OF TRANSPORTATION COSTS AND SLOWER

41:59 COMING OUT AT A TIME WHEN LOCALLY FOOD PRICES ARE STILL

42:00 ELEVATED.

42:06 JONATHAN: RUSSIA HAS KILLED THE GREEN

42:13 DEAL ATTACKING HAVE SEEN HIGHLIGHTS OF THAT ONCE AGAIN

42:17 WHICH IS COMPROMISING THE BLACK SEA. CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT

42:23 ALTERNATIVE ROUTES ARE AND WHY THEY ARE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN

42:25 JUST GOING TO THE BLACK SEA LIKE THEY TYPICALLY WOULD?

42:31 KONA: IT WOULD BE THE PORT OF THE NEW

42:39 -- PART OF DENUBE.

42:51 THEY REQUIRE A SMALLER BARGES,

42:58 WE ARE TALKING SMALL AMOUNTS OF QUANTITIES EACH TIME GOING

43:01 THROUGH DIFFERENT ROUTES AND NOT AS EFFECTIVE.

43:07 NO ONE IS GOING TO ENSURE A SHIP COMING INTO THE BLACK SEA

43:08 REGION. IT IS TOO RISKY FOR THEM.

43:18 IT ALSO HELPS RUSSIA. THEY WILL TRY TO GRAB THE

43:21 MARKET SHARE THAT UKRAINE IS NOT ABLE TO GET.

43:26 SO RUSSIA WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE IN TRIED TO GET TO THE BIG

43:31 IMPORTING NATIONS LIKE AFRICA, SOUTH ASIA, EGYPT.

43:35 IN THOSE COUNTRIES RIGHT -- RELYING ON UKRAINIAN WHEAT WILL

43:39 NOW HAVE TO USE RUSSIAN WHEAT. JONATHAN:

43:46 OUT ARE EXPORTING NATIONS RESPONDING?

43:51 IS A MORE PROTECTIONISM AROUND GOODS STOCKING UP AT HOME? KONA:

43:56 THE FAR WE HAVEN'T SEEN IT TOO MUCH OF THAT, ONLY BECAUSE IN

44:02 THE YEAR SINCE UKRAINE WAS LAST -- FIRST ATTACKED BY RUSSIA ,

44:11 THE HEIGHT SPIKE IN PRICES HAVE LED TO STOCKING.

44:13 WE HAVE SEEN PRICES BUILT UP SO THE PANIC IS NOT QUITE THERE.

44:19 IF THE BLACK SEA IS CUT OFF FOR TOO LONG, YOU WILL START TO SEE

44:20 PANIC SET IN.

44:26 ONE THING WE ARE NOTICING WITH WHEAT AND GRAIN, RICE IN INDIA

44:32 AS JUST BEEN GIVEN A MAN ON EXPORTS AND INDIA IS THE

44:34 LARGEST FOR RICE EXPORTS.

44:41 IT IS NOT NECESSARY GREENS BUT IT IS A MASSIVE STABLE AND HALF

44:47 OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION RELY ON RICE. TOM:

44:51 THIS IS SO IMPORTANT. I LOOK AT WHEAT AND SA WHAT

44:57 DOES IT MEAN FOR A LOAF OF BREAD AT THE FANCY GROCERY

44:59 STORE IN NEW YORK CITY? THAT IS COMPLETELY REMOVED FROM

45:02 REALITY. EXPLAIN WHAT WE PRICE DYNAMICS

45:10 -- WHAT WHEAT PRICE DYNAMICS MEAN ACROSS THE MEDITERRANEAN

45:11 AND THE PEOPLE IN EGYPT. GIVE US THE SCOPE AND SCALE WE

45:16 IN THE FANCY WEST TO UNDERSTAND. KONA:

45:21 IT IS THE FACT THAT THEY ARE EMERGING MARKETS.

45:24 THEY ARE NOT AS ADVANCED AS THEY ARE IN THE WEST. IT MEANS

45:32 MOST GETS'S DENSE ON FOOD ITEMS IN STAPLES.

45:37 CONSUMPTION IN DAILY BASIS, FOOD RANKS HIGHLY AND A STAPLE

45:40 IS BREAD OR RICE.

45:51 THERE IS A SITUATION WHERE IT IS REALLY AFFECTING THE COST OF

45:56 LIVING AND IMPACTING THEM ECONOMICALLY.

46:08 BACK IN 2008 WE SAW FOOD RIOTS IN AFRICA. IT IS HOT TOPIC MOST

46:10 GOVERNMENTS WOULD WANT TO AVOID. YOU COULD ARGUE THE ARAB SPRING

46:16 HAPPENED BECAUSE OF THE FOOD RIOTS.

46:18 THIS IS SOMETHING GOVERNMENTS WILL BE LOOKING AT CAREFULLY.

46:26 JONATHAN: I WOULDN'T EXPECT YOU TO

46:28 COMMENT ON POLITICS BUT RUSSIA HAS VERY FEW FRIENDS ON THE

46:29 INTERNATIONAL STAGE AT THE MOMENT.

46:33 PERHAPS YOU COULD DESCRIBE TURKEY AS INTERMEDIARY BETWEEN

46:36 RUSSIA AND THE REST OF YOUR APPEAR CHINA HAS BEEN A FRIEND

46:39 ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE. WHERE WOULD THIS LEAVE CHINA'S

46:45 GRAIN IMPORTS AND FOOD PRICES GIVEN WHAT IS DEVELOPING AT THE

46:46 MOMENT? KONA: BENNETT HAS A DISINFLATION

46:51 PROBLEM.

47:00 THEY WERE CLEVER IN TERMS OF OR THING IN A WHEN PRICES WERE LOW.

47:09 CHINA AND RUSSIA UNFRIENDLY TERM SO THEY WILL BE ABLE TO

47:12 GET EVERYTHING THEY NEED FROM RUSSIA AND THAT WILL NOT BE A

47:13 PROBLEM.

47:21 IN TERMS OF RICE, IT IS SOMETHING THAT CHINA HAS A

47:25 PROBLEM WITH BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY THE HEAT WAVE.

47:34 THAT IS SOMETHING THEY MAY NEED TO LOOK AT CAREFULLY. JONATHAN:

47:37 THANK YOU. TOM: REALLY INFORMATIVE.

47:43 JONATHAN: DIFFICULTY IN SOFT COMMODITIES

47:45 WITH THE WHEAT STORY AND THE BLACK SEA. TOM:

47:51 YOU KNOW I AM FOCUSED ON THIS IS THE ADVENT OF THIS TERRIBLE

47:53 WAR IN THE FEBRUARY OF LAST YEAR.

47:55 THE NEWS ORGANIZATIONS HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB.

48:04 CAN I MENTIONED THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM HERE?

48:11 12 WANT -- 12 MONTHS TRAILING, WANT TO LOOK BACK TWO YEARS TO

48:17 2019, STANDARD & POOR'S 500 UP 15%, THE DOW UP 10% AND THE

48:21 NASDAQ ROARING UP 24%. IT IS A DOUBLE-DIGIT STOCK

48:27 RECKITT 12 MONTHS TRAILING THAT -- STOCK MARKET AND THAT IS THE

48:31 12 MONTH TRAILING. JONATHAN: 41%.

48:37 TOM: WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT

48:39 THE MONTH OF AUGUST BRINGS. JONATHAN:

48:47 CONVERSATION ON THE EQUITY MARKET ON THE MASSIVE RUN

48:49 YEAR-TO-DATE AND A BIG WEEK OF EARNINGS IN AMERICA.

48:53 EQUITY FUTURES POSITIVE ON THE S&P 500.

49:10 ♪ >> OF COURSE, THE EQUITY MARKET HAS LARGELY BEEN DRIVEN

49:11 BY TECH STOCKS.

49:14 >> A RECESSION SHOULD BE STARTING.

49:18 >> I THINK IT IS A LITTLE WARNING.

49:21 >> WE ARE RESTRICTIVE, NOT SUPER RESTRICTIVE.

49:25 >> YOU HAVE ECHOES AND RAMIFICATIONS OF THE FED'S

49:27 ACTIONS THAT REMAIN TO BE SEEN.

49:31 >> THIS IS "BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE." JONATHAN:

49:37 LET'S GET YOUR WEEK STARTED LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY THIS

49:38 MORNING. GOOD MORNING TO OUR AUDIENCE

49:39 WORLDWIDE. THIS IS "BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE

49:41 ."

49:47 YOUR EQUITY MARKET, 0.2% POSITIVE.

49:50 ONE OF THOSE SPECIAL WEEKS YOU GET ONCE A QUARTER, A TRIO, A

49:51 TRILOGY. THE CENTRAL BANK DECISION JUST

49:57 AROUND THE CORNER AND TONS FROM BIG TECH INTO NEXT WEEK. TOM:

50:01 I WILL LET YOU DECIDE WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT.

50:04 EARNINGS ARE FRONT AND CENTER FOR PEOPLE IN THE MARKET.

50:09 PEOPLE NOT IN THE MARKET, IT IS ABOUT FED POLICY.

50:13 WHAT IS UNIQUE AS THEY ARE ALL THE SAME BUNDLES WITH THE

50:15 CHALLENGES OF GLOBAL GROWTH, BUT THE FED, ECB, AND BANK OF

50:19 JAPAN HAVING DISCRETE CONVERSATIONS. JONATHAN:

50:24 A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE SIDELINES WONDERING WHETHER IT

50:25 IS ONE AND DONE FOR THE FEDERAL RESERVE.

50:29 I THINK THIS FEDERAL RESERVE WILL REFUSE TO EMBRACE ONE AND

50:32 DONE AND RETAIN THAT THAT OF MORE TO COME -- RETAINED THE

50:36 THREAT OF MORE TO COME. WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO GET

50:39 BURNED TWICE? TOM:

50:45 I WILL LOOK AT JEROME AND CHRISTINE LIKE I LOOK AT BARBIE

50:49 AND KEN, ON THE JOURNEY OF SELF-DISCOVERY. JONATHAN:

50:51 WHICH ONE IS BARBIE? TOM: PLEASE.

50:55 MADAME LAGARDE WILL TAKE THE TROPHY AS BARBIE.

51:00 THE JOURNEY STARTS WITH WHAT WE SEE IN DATA CREATED LAST WEEK,

51:03 THE DATA WAS SOFT. NO OTHER WAY TO PUT IT.

51:08 JONATHAN: BETTER-THAN-EXPECTED. TOM: OK. JONATHAN:

51:11 STOOD UP TO A MASSIVE RATE HIKE AND CYCLE FROM THE FEDERAL

51:16 RESERVE. STILL HAVE UNEMPLOYMENT AROUND

51:18 3.5%. INFLATION GOING FROM 3%, 4%

51:23 DOWN TO 2%. YOU ARE ASSUMING UNAPPOINTED

51:27 HAS TO GO HIGHER. TOM: THE PRESSURE ON THE WALL OF

51:37 MONEY OUT THERE TO GET ON BOARD IN SOME WAY HEDGE, UNHEDGED,

51:39 WHATEVER. THE PRESSURE IS EXTRAORDINARY.

51:49 JONATHAN: 5%, GOOD THE FIRST COUPLE

51:52 WEEKS OF 2023, AND THEN TECH ABSOLUTELY RIPPED.

51:57 THIS WEEK ALONE, YOU WILL GET ALPHABET, GOOGLE, MICROSOFT

52:01 TOMORROW, AND THEN ON WEDNESDAY, META, FACEBOOK,

52:05 AMAZON ON THURSDAY. THE FOLLOWING THURSDAY, MORE.

52:11 TOM: YOU DID NOT HEAR FROM APPLE,

52:14 BUT YOU WONDER HOW MUCH IS OWNED.

52:17 SOME SAY IT IS UNDER OWNED BY WALL STREET.

52:20 IT IS AN OLD WAR HORSE. I WILL NOT MENTION THE NAME.

52:26 ONE YEAR COME UP 13%. I BELIEVE THAT IS A DOUBLE

52:27 DIGIT RETURN. DO THEY FEEL LIKE A FAILURE?

52:33 THAT PRESSURE IS THERE. JONATHAN:

52:37 HEAVING THE STORY ON APPLE THIS MORNING, APPLE IS ASKING 85

52:44 MILLION UNITS TO BE SUPPLIED FOR THE IPHONE THIS YEAR.

52:49 OUR REPORTING SUGGESTING THEY ARE TURNED TO PUSH FOR A HIGHER

52:50 AVERAGE BUYING PRICE. JUST IMAGINE THE PRICE OF THE

52:53 PRO MODELS. STABLE BUT YOU GET A BETTER

52:56 PRICE. TOM:

53:02 JUST AS IMPORTANT, MARGIN DISCOVERY.

53:09 ONE OF THE GREAT CALLS ON APPLE THAT WAS WRONG WAS THE MARGIN

53:14 CORROSION. THE VIX 14.23, STILL RESILIENT.

53:18 NOT 12, BUT I WILL TICKET. JONATHAN:

53:25 -- BUT I WILL TAKE IT. JONATHAN: AROUND EUROPE, DREADFUL IN THE

53:30 EURO ZONE. TOM:

53:37 DO YOU ROUND SPX UP TO 4600? JONATHAN:

53:39 WE ARE ON RECORD HIGH WATCH. WE ARE LIKE 6% AWAY. TOM:

53:48 I CAN STILL GET USED TO 4571 ON THE SPX. LIKE, WOW, WE ARE HERE.

53:52 JONATHAN: YOU KNOW WHO ELSE IS HERE COME

53:58 OUR GUEST -- HERE, OUR GUEST. GOOD MORNING.

54:03 WE WILL START WITH A SIMPLE QUESTION, WHAT TAKES YOUR FANCY

54:04 THIS WEEK? WHAT IS YOUR FOCUS?

54:08 >> ALL OF IT. CENTRAL BANK. TECH.

54:16 LOTS FROM THE MICRO AND MACRO FRONT.

54:22 BUT I THINK PROBABLY -- TOM WAS SAYING THIS EARLIER, THOSE NOT

54:26 IN THE MARKETS, WHAT YOU SHOULD FOCUS ON IS ACTUALLY HOW THEY

54:31 SIGNAL WHAT IS COMING AFTER.

54:37 SO HOW MUCH THEY CAN KEEP THE OPTIONALITY OPEN.

54:41 THAT IS WHAT DETERMINES THE OUTCOME OF THE FED FROM HERE ON

54:45 OUT. JONATHAN: I AM ASSUMING YOU WOULD GUESS

54:47 THE CHAIRMAN WILL TRY TO TAKE THAT OPTION WITH AN ADDITIONAL

54:50 RATE HIKE FROM HERE.

54:51 >> THEY SHOULD. THEY WILL TRY VERY HARD NOT TO

54:55 LOCK THEMSELVES INTO ANOTHER SEPTEMBER HIKE.

54:59 HOPEFULLY THEY DO ACKNOWLEDGE THERE HAS BEEN SOME SOFTENING

55:03 IN INFLATION BECAUSE THAT IS FACTUALLY CORRECT.

55:06 BUT THE SAME TIME, IT IS TOO EARLY TO CALL A VICTORY ON THE

55:09 INFLATION BATTLE. AFTER THAT, WHAT THEY SHOULD DO

55:14 IS LEAVE ALL DOORS OPEN SO THEY CAN GO AGAIN IN NOVEMBER OR

55:16 THIS CAN BE THE END. IF THIS IS TRULY THE BEGINNING

55:22 OF WHAT I THINK IS A DECELERATION, NOT BACK TO 2%

55:27 BUT BACK TO A MUCH MORE PALATABLE 3% OR 3.5% ON CORE

55:29 CPI. THIS COULD BE THE LAST HIKE,

55:33 AND THEY SHOULD LEAVE THAT DOOR OPEN. TOM:

55:35 THE SUMMER RACE IS ON. THERE WERE THREE BIG FIGURES.

55:41 WHAT IS THAT ABOUT?

55:47 SUMMER IS MOVING ON, AND YOU ARE RIGHT ABOUT BUY AT THE END

55:50 OF MAY.

55:56 SOMETHING HAPPENED MAY 24, 25, 26.

56:03 WHAT HAPPENED AT THE END OF MAY? >> THE EQUITY MARKET STARTED

56:06 BROADENING OUT. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN OVER THE

56:15 COURSE OF JUNE AND JULY IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE EQUAL WEIGHTED

56:20 INDEX, THAT HAS STARTED KEEPING IN PACE WITH THE BROADER S&P.

56:22 WHY? WHAT HAPPENED IN THE MACRO? I THINK NUMBER ONE, THE GROWTH

56:29 DATA STARTED NOT DISAPPOINTING SO MUCH.

56:31 THE GROWTH DATA STARTED GETTING BETTER.

56:36 IF YOU LOOK AT RETAIL SALES, IF YOU LOOK AT INITIAL JOBLESS

56:41 CLAIMS, ALL OF THAT IS REMAINING RESILIENT.

56:44 I THINK RESILIENT IS THE WORD OF THE SUMMER.

56:48 SECOND MOST IMPORTANT AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANT IS

56:49 INFLATION FINALLY TOOK A LITTLE BIT OF A BREATHER.

56:52 THAT IS MORE OF A JULY STORY. TOM:

56:56 MORE OF A JULY STORY, BUT THE

57:04 BOTTOM LINE IS PEOPLE INCLUDING A HUGE PART OF WALL STREET,

57:07 WHAT IS THE TO DO LIST NOW TO BUY AT THE MARGIN SO I CATCH UP

57:10 INTO NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER?

57:15 >> THIS IS ABOUT AS GOOD DATA

57:23 AS WE WILL GET, AND THE FED IS CLOSE TO BEING DONE SO CALL IT

57:24 ONE MORE RATE HIKE AT THE MOST AFTER THIS WEEK.

57:27 I THINK YOU CAN PLAY FOR THE QUICK CATCH-UP TRADE.

57:30 I THINK THAT DOES MAKE SENSE. WE HAVE SEEN FROM THE ETF SPACE

57:35 WHERE INVESTORS ARE PLAYING FOR THE CATCH-UP TRADE.

57:39 NUMBER TWO, STILL FOCUSING ON QUALITY, STILL LOOKING AT

57:45 COMPANIES, WE WILL FIND THIS THIS WEEK, BUT LOOKING AT

57:46 OPPORTUNITIES. WE SAW HOW MUCH THE COMPANIES

57:51 THAT MISSED ON THE PROFIT MARGIN GOT POLISHED SO THAT IS

57:53 SOMETHING TO FOCUS ON. TOM:

57:59 WHAT IS INTERESTING HERE, SOME DISCONTINUOUS TRENDS HERE.

58:05 SOMEBODY WAS OUT THERE OVER THE

58:11 WEEKEND SAYING BACK IN 1979 -- GINA MARTIN ADAMS, LARGE AND

58:15 SMALL CAPS PARTITION GOES BACK TO 1979.

58:20 >> NOT YET.

58:26 MAYBE FOR A WEEK OR SO, BUT I THINK BROADLY -- TOM:

58:30 DAYTRADING.

58:31 >> LISTEN, THIS IS AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE YOU HAVE TO

58:34 BE MORE NIMBLE. I DO THINK IT IS ABOUT

58:37 DAYTRADING. IT IS ABOUT RECOGNIZING THE

58:43 DATA CAN BE CHANGED AND WE HAVE TO BE NUMBER ENOUGH TO CHANGE

58:47 OUR MINDS EVERY FOUR OR SIX WEEKS SETTING UP FOR A NEW

58:48 STORY. NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO LOAD UP

58:52 THE BOX WITH SMALL CAPS. CAN WE HAVE A QUICK SMALL CAPS

58:56 CATCH-UP TRADE FOR 12 DAYS? SURE. JONATHAN:

59:00 YOU SAY IT IS TIME TO GET DEFENSIVE.

59:02 WHAT IS DEFENSIVE TO YOU?

59:06 >> DEFENSIVE TO US IS QUALITY COMPANIES, DIVIDEND COMPANIES,

59:13 ACTUALLY MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF VOLATILITY SO IF YOU HAVE THE

59:14 DOWNTURN YOU ARE STILL

59:20 REMAINING INVESTED WITH A LEVEL, BUT DEFENSIVE DOES NOT

59:22 MEAN TO LEAVE THE MARKETS AND GO TO CASH.

59:26 DEFENSIVE MEANS STAYING IN THE PARTS OF THE MARKET THAT ARE

59:30 LIKELY TO OUTPERFORM LIKE THE LARGE CAPS IN A SLIGHTLY HIGHER

59:34 VOLATILITY ENVIRONMENT. JONATHAN:

59:40 WHERE DOES AI FIT INTO THIS? THERE IS SOME DOUBT NOW ON HOW

59:42 YOU SHOULD PLAY IT.

59:44 >> I KNOW. I DEFINITELY THINK THIS

59:48 EARNINGS SEASON, ONE OF THE THINGS WE WILL PROBABLY SEE IS

59:51 EVERY COMPANY TRYING TO MAKE THEMSELVES OUT TO BE AN AI

59:55 COMPANY. IT IS CHOOSING WHICH COMPANIES

01:00:00 ARE ACTUALLY USING AI TO GAIN EFFICIENCIES VERSUS NOT.

01:00:06 WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS SOON IN OUR MIDYEAR OUTLOOK.

01:00:11 THE REASON WE PUT IT THAT WAY IS THIS WILL BE WITH US FOR A

01:00:15 LONG TIME, BUT IT HAS ALREADY OBVIOUSLY IMPACTED PERFORMANCE

01:00:18 THIS YEAR. YOU CAN PLAY THIS THROUGH FIXED

01:00:20 INCOME, BUT REMEMBERING THIS IS NOT TOMORROW'S TRADE BUT THIS

01:00:22 WILL STAY WITH US. AI REMAINS WITH US.

01:00:28 THINKING ABOUT AI AND PRODUCTIVITY IS IMPORTANT.

01:00:33 LOOKING AT AI ENABLERS AND DEVELOPERS WILL BE THE NEXT LEG.

01:00:37 TOM: IS AI A BRANDED TECHNOLOGICAL

01:00:44 PROGRESS FROM ANOTHER TIME AND PLACE? I THINK IT IS A BRILLIANT

01:00:51 ANSWER, BUT SHE SAYS IT IS OUT THERE FARTHER. JONATHAN:

01:00:54 I THINK IT IS PART OF TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS, SURE.

01:00:59 THE PROBLEM WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS EVERYONE WILL GO ON THE CALL

01:01:03 THIS EARNINGS SEASON AND SAY "WE ARE DOING AI."

01:01:07 IT WILL BE 20 DIFFERENT THINGS TO 20 DIFFERENT PEOPLE. TOM:

01:01:12 I WANT TO GO TO A SIMPLER WORLD LIKE A BEACH CABIN. JONATHAN:

01:01:16 WHERE ARE YOU GOING WITH THIS THIS MORNING? TOM:

01:01:19 I SAW "BARBIE" THREE TIMES. JONATHAN:

01:01:23 YOU ACTUALLY WATCHED THIS MOVIE? TOM:

01:01:27 I THOUGHT BEACH KEN IS WHERE WE SHOULD BE. JONATHAN:

01:01:29 I DON'T BELIEVE YOU. THANK YOU. TOM: DID YOU SEE IT?

01:01:34 >> I DID NOT. [LAUGHTER]

01:01:39 >> "OPPENHEIMER," THOUGH. JONATHAN: YOU HAVE SEEN THAT?

01:01:43 >> I AM GOING TO TODAY. JONATHAN:

01:01:49 PEOPLE GO TO THE MOVIES AT SUNDAY NIGHT.

01:01:51 >> I HAD TO BE HERE THIS MORNING. JONATHAN:

01:01:54 IT IS THREE HOURS. THEY HAVE A LIFE. TOM:

01:01:59 WE HAVE PEOPLE COME ON THE SHOW. >> I AM NOT LIVING MY RIGHT

01:02:04 LIFE, I DON'T THINK. JONATHAN:

01:02:11 COMING UP A LITTLE BIT LATER, A GUEST FROM DEUTSCHE BANK,

01:02:15 LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS CONVERSATION A LITTLE LATER

01:02:18 THIS HOUR. AND THEN WE WILL CATCH UP WITH

01:02:22 ANOTHER GUEST AT 7:30 EASTERN TIME.

01:02:24 TONS OF EARNINGS AROUND THE CORNER AND THE CENTRAL BANK

01:02:27 DAYS AWAY. TOM: I HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS EARNINGS

01:02:31 SEASON. WE MAKE JOKES ABOUT IT, BUT

01:02:33 THIS IS ABOUT PEOPLE'S CAREERS, THEIR ADVANCEMENT INTO 2024.

01:02:38 IT IS A JUMBLE. IT WILL BE FASCINATING.

01:02:42 JUST FASCINATING. JONATHAN: COULD NOT AGREE MORE.

01:02:47 SPECIAL COVERAGE ON WEDNESDAY OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE DECISION.

01:02:51 THERE WILL BE AN APPEARANCE. TOM: I DID NOT KNOW THAT.

01:02:55 JONATHAN: I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG SHE WILL

01:02:56 STICK AROUND. SHE WILL COME BACK FOR A FED

01:02:59 VISIT. TOM: A DAY OR TWO. JONATHAN:

01:03:04 VERY EUROPEAN THESE DAYS. TOM: SHE HAS TAKEN OFF ALL MONTH.

01:03:09 JONATHAN: EQUITIES AT 0.2% ON THE S&P 500.

01:03:16 FROM NEW YORK, THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

01:03:30 >> IN TERMS OF WHAT RUSSIA SOUGHT TO ACHIEVE, EVERYONE

01:03:36 SAYS THEY ALREADY LOST. THE OBJECTIVE, TO ERASE UKRAINE

01:03:38 FROM THE MAP. THAT FAILED A LONG TIME AGO.

01:03:44 UNLIKE THE RUSSIANS, THE UKRAINIANS ARE FIGHTING FOR

01:03:47 THEIR LAND, THEIR FUTURE, THEIR COUNTRY, THEIR FREEDOM.

01:03:50 I THINK THAT IS THE DECISIVE ELEMENT, AND IT WILL PLAY OUT

01:03:55 BUT NOT OVER THE NEXT WEEK OR TWO.

01:03:56 WE ARE STILL LOOKING SEVERAL MONTHS. JONATHAN: THE U.S.

01:03:59 SECRETARY OF STATE SPEAKING OVER THE WEEKEND.

01:04:01 GOOD MORNING TO YOU ALL. EQUITY FUTURES JUST A LITTLE

01:04:09 BIT POSITIVE BY 0.2 PERCENT ON THE S&P 500.

01:04:13 WE HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS A FEW TIMES BUT IT IS WORTH GOING

01:04:18 THROUGH IT AGAIN. META ON WEDNESDAY.

01:04:20 AMAZON ON THURSDAY. FOLLOWING THURSDAY, YOU WILL

01:04:22 HEAR FROM APPLE. IPHONE SHIPMENTS, WE WILL GET

01:04:25 TO THAT LATER THIS MORNING. BEYOND THE EQUITY MARKET, IN

01:04:30 BONDS, A RALLY WORLDWIDE.

01:04:36 ON THE 10 YEAR, 3.8016.

01:04:42 REALLY REALLY TOUGH PMI'S OUT OF THE EURO FROM THE MONTH OF

01:04:46 JULY. NOT A GREAT START, LET'S PUT IT

01:04:49 THAT WAY. TOM: GERMANY AS WELL.

01:04:56 DIFFERENT OVERLAYS HERE, BUT

01:05:03 THEY GET A STRANGE CHOICE -- STRAINED CHOICE THAT MAXIME

01:05:04 LAGARDE HAS. WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON INFLATION

01:05:07 THIS YEAR? I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT SITS.

01:05:14 JONATHAN: EUROPE, THE ECB HAS HIKED

01:05:16 BEFORE WHEN PMI WAS TERRIBLE AT INFLATION WAS PROBLEMATIC.

01:05:19 I WOULD SAY THE DEFINITION FOR PROBLEMATIC WAS DIFFERENT IN

01:05:23 2008 AND 2011 COMPARED TO NOW. THE HIKES THEY MADE BACK THEN

01:05:27 TURNED OUT TO BE BIG MISTAKES. I WONDER HOW MUCH OF THAT COMES

01:05:31 UP IN THE NEWS CONFERENCE THIS WEEK ON THURSDAY.

01:05:37 TOM: I WILL SUGGEST THE ECB NEWS CONFERENCE WILL BE MORE

01:05:40 INFORMATIVE AND SIT ON THE EDGE

01:05:47 OF YOUR SEAT GIVEN THE BACKDROP. TOM:

01:05:55 OUR BLOOMBERG WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, YOU CAN THROW

01:05:58 ANYTHING AT HER. IT IS THE KIND OF MONDAY IT IS.

01:06:06 WHAT IS SEARED IN MY MEMORY IS THAT ISRAEL I KNEW, THE

01:06:10 EXPERIMENT I KNEW THAT ENDED WITH AN ASSASSINATION IN

01:06:13 NOVEMBER OF 1995.

01:06:27 WHAT I AM READING FROM THE MEDIA , FROM EXPERTS LIKE YOU, NOW IS

01:06:30 A MOMENTOUS TIME IN CONTEMPORARY ISRAEL.

01:06:32 THE ILLNESS OF NETANYAHU AND ALL THE JUDICIAL TURMOIL.

01:06:37 HOW DOES WASHINGTON ADDRESS THAT?

01:06:41 >> A STATEMENT FROM THE PRESIDENT SAYING BASICALLY A

01:06:46 NOD TO HOPING NETANYAHU WOULD BACK OFF ON THIS AND SAYING

01:06:51 THAT WHAT ISRAEL NEEDS TO DO IS FIND CONSENSUS, REALLY TRYING

01:06:56 TO SLOW DOWN, AND PUT SOME PRESSURE ON THE BRAKES WHEN IT

01:06:59 COMES TO A JUDICIAL OVERHAUL, BECAUSE WE SHOULD ALSO NOTE

01:07:04 THERE HAS BEEN NOT JUST RECENTLY PROTESTS BUT OVER THE

01:07:09 PAST FEW MONTHS PROTESTS REGARDING THIS.

01:07:11 BY AND LARGE, IT LOOKS LIKE THE POPULATION DOES NOT WANT TO SEE

01:07:12 THIS GO THROUGH. IT EVEN COST NETANYAHU HIS

01:07:16 GOVERNMENT THE LAST TIME AROUND. THIS IS A CONCERN.

01:07:19 IT IS ALSO INTERESTING. WE HAD THE PRESIDENT OF ISRAEL

01:07:22 HERE IN THE U.S. THERE WAS A JOINT SESSION OF

01:07:26 PROGRESS, AND HE ALSO SPOKE WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN.

01:07:32 IT WAS ANNOUNCED, AN INVITATION TO THE YAHOO!, BUT INTERESTING

01:07:35 THAT NO DATE OR TIME WAS IN THE INVITATION.

01:07:37 JUST THAT WE HOPE AT SOME POINT YOU CAN COME TO THE UNITED

01:07:39 STATES. AND THEN OF COURSE HE HAS

01:07:42 HEALTH CONCERNS. A PACEMAKER WAS ANNOUNCED THIS

01:07:47 WEEKEND, AND WE SEE HIM STILL WANTING TO PUSH THROUGH THIS

01:07:51 JUDICIAL OVERHAUL. TOM: FOR "BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE ,"

01:07:57 IT IS ABOUT JACOB FRANKEL, THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ISRAEL,

01:07:59 AND STANLEY FISHER AS WELL. BUT IT GOES MUCH MORE BEYOND

01:08:02 THAT. DESCRIBE A TRADITIONAL JEWISH

01:08:07 LOBBY.

01:08:13 DESCRIBE THAT JEWISH LOBBY NOW THAT YOU REPORT ON EACH AND

01:08:14 EVERY DAY.

01:08:19 >> THERE IS A NUMBER OF JEWISH LOBBIES WITHIN WASHINGTON, D.C.

01:08:23 I THINK IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE ISSUES AT HAND.

01:08:27 MOST OF THE JEWISH POPULATION IN AMERICA DOES LEAN LEFT.

01:08:34 OBVIOUSLY, THERE IS A SMALLER GROUP OF ORTHODOX JEWISH

01:08:39 INDIVIDUALS WHO LEAN CONSERVATIVE RIGHT, BUT IT

01:08:42 REALLY DEPENDS ON THE ISSUE.

01:08:45 WHAT YOU DID SEE RECENTLY, WE SHOULD NOTE, WAS A FULL-FLEDGED

01:08:49 BACKING OF THE ISRAELI STATE AND JEWISH FRIENDS WHEN YOU HAD

01:08:53 THE CHAIR OF THE PROGRESSIVE CAUCUS COME OUT AND CALL ISRAEL

01:08:55 A RACIST STATE. SHE HAS SINCE WALK THAT BACK.

01:09:03 THIS WAS CENTERED AROUND SOME INDIVIDUALS WHO ALSO THEN

01:09:06 DECIDED TO PROTEST AND NOT SHOW UP TO THE SPEECH IN CONGRESS.

01:09:08 TOM: I LOOK AT THIS AND TO ME IT IS

01:09:11 A CHANGE. I DON'T SEE A CHANGE OF PACE

01:09:17 LIKE 10 YEARS AGO OR 30 YEARS AGO. JONATHAN:

01:09:21 IT SPEAKS TO THE DOMESTIC ISSUES OVER THE WEEKEND.

01:09:26 GOVERNOR DESANTIS IN FLORIDA FALLING TO THIRD PLACE.

01:09:31 THERE ARE OBVIOUS REASONS FOR THAT GIVEN THE CANDIDATES

01:09:32 INVOLVED, BUT HOW MUCH OF A SHIFT ARE WE ABOUT TO SEE FROM

01:09:34 HIS CAMPAIGN?

01:09:39 >> WHEN YOU LOOK AT IOWA, I AM LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS NOW.

01:09:44 DONALD TRUMP, RON DESANTIS, THE NUMBERS DROPPING PRECIPITOUSLY.

01:09:48 ONE THING IN MY READING OVER THE WEEKEND IS YOU ARE SEEING

01:09:52 MOMENTUM FOR TIM SCOTT BECOMING THE THIRD IN IOWA.

01:09:56 YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE IOWA -- THIS IS A NEW NAME SO IT DOES

01:10:02 NOT HAVE THE SAME NAME RECOGNITION A FORMER PRESIDENT

01:10:05 WOULD HAVE TO GET THEY ARE RUNNING AGAINST AN INCUMBENT IN

01:10:09 THE PRIMARY AGAINST A FORMER PRESIDENT.

01:10:13 YOU LOOK AT GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS AND "THE NEW YORK

01:10:14 TIMES" HAD A BIG STORY OVER THE WEEKEND ABOUT HIM, THE BIG

01:10:19 REBOOT, AND WHAT THE CAMPAIGN IS TRYING TO DO.

01:10:22 THEY WANT TO BECOME LEANER AND MEANER.

01:10:25 THEY HAVE SHED SOME STAFF BECAUSE THEY ARE REALLY

01:10:27 PLUMMETING THROUGH A LOT OF THE CASH THEY HAD ON HAND.

01:10:30 THAT HAS BEEN A CONCERN FOR A LOT OF DONORS, WHICH IS WHY YOU

01:10:34 SEE SOME STILL WANTING TO WAIT IN THE WINGS BEFORE THEY DROP

01:10:40 MORE MONEY OR SOME OTHER DONORS TO GET INVOLVED.

01:10:45 THEY WANT TO SEE IF THIS RESTART OR REFRESH REALLY WORKS.

01:10:48 JONATHAN: FOLLOW THE MONEY. WHERE IS THE MONEY GOING?

01:10:52 >> THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION. AT THE MOMENT, THERE IS A LOT

01:10:56 OF MONEY THAT IS JUST ON PAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BIG CASH,

01:10:59 BUT THEN YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THESE SMALLER DONORS.

01:11:03 WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE SMALLER DONORS, A LOT OF THE MONEY THE

01:11:08 FORMER PRESIDENT IS ABLE TO

01:11:14 BRING IN, IT COMES TO AN INDIVIDUAL DONATING $5,000 OR

01:11:16 0,000. AT THE MOMENT, A LOT OF THESE

01:11:19 PEOPLE ARE WAITING ON THE SIDELINES. THEY WANT TO SEE WHO

01:11:23 POTENTIALLY CAN EMERGE FROM THIS PACK.

01:11:27 IS IT SENATOR TIM SCOTT, WHO IS AT THIS POINT STARTING TO GET

01:11:30 MOMENTUM? OR IS IT SOMEONE WHO HAS NOT

01:11:32 ENTERED THE RACE? I HEAR RUMORS ABOUT A POTENTIAL

01:11:38 GOVERNOR GETTING INTO THE RACE AT SOME POINT IN THE FALL, BUT

01:11:40 THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN. JONATHAN:

01:11:43 WE HEARD THAT IN THE LAST HOUR AS WELL.

01:11:46 A LOT OF PEOPLE SUSPECTING THAT MAY OR MAY NOT HAPPEN THE LAST

01:11:48 FEW MONTHS. NEXT MONTH, FOX NEWS HOSTS THE

01:11:50 FIRST DEBATE. ON THE DEBATE STAGE, A HOST OF

01:11:53 CHARACTERS. WILL THOSE CHARACTERS INCLUDE

01:11:57 THE FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP?

01:11:59 >> WE STILL DON'T KNOW YET. I SAW HIM PUT OUT ONTO SOCIAL

01:12:05 OVER THE WEEKEND THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

01:12:08 THIS, A COUNTER PROGRAM BEFORE HIM AND TUCKER CARLSEN. I

01:12:13 BELIEVE HE HAS A SHOW ON TWITTER OR X OR WHATEVER WE ARE

01:12:15 CALLING IT THIS MORNING. IT TOTALLY DEPENDS.

01:12:19 WE JUST DON'T KNOW YET.

01:12:25 THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY CHRIS CHRISTIE HAS SAID

01:12:28 HE SHOULD SHOW UP TO THE DEBATE. JONATHAN: THANK YOU.

01:12:32 THAT DEBATE IS ABOUT A MONTH AWAY. ONE MONTH AWAY.

01:12:36 JUST AROUND THE CORNER. AND THEN 18 MONTHS OF IT. TOM:

01:12:38 MORE. JONATHAN: A SOLID YEAR AND A HALF OF

01:12:42 CAMPAIGNING COMING UP. FROM NEW YORK CITY THIS

01:12:45 MORNING, GOOD MORNING TO YOU ALL.

01:13:03 ♪ JONATHAN: JUST ABOUT SQUEEZED OUT A SECOND WEEK OF GAINS ON

01:13:06 THE S&P 500. SOME UNDERPERFORMANCE ON THE

01:13:07 NASDAQ LAST WEEK THROUGH THIS WEEK.

01:13:12 THIS MORNING, THE POSITIVE BY 0.3% ON THE NASDAQ 100.

01:13:16 40% OF THE MARKET CAP ON THE S&P 500 REPORTING EARNINGS THIS

01:13:19 WEEK. IT IS ONTO APPLE NEXT WEEK.

01:13:23 SOME NEWS ON APPLE IN JUST A MOMENT.

01:13:28 IN THE BOND MARKET, YOU WILL NOTICE A RALLY WITH YIELDS

01:13:29 LOWER BY FOUR BASIS POINTS ON THE 10 YEAR, DOWN A SINGLE

01:13:34 BASIS POINT TO 482. IF YOU ARE LONG TREASURIES, YOU

01:13:37 CAN THINK YOU'RE UP THIS THIS MORNING.

01:13:40 THE PMI'S ARE PRETTY DREADFUL OUT OF THE EUROZONE AND U.K.

01:13:41 FOR THAT MATTER. THE EURO WEAKER OFF THE BACK OF

01:13:43 IT. SESSION LOWS AT 111.

01:13:50 -0.2% ON THE CURRENT PATH. THE LATEST FROM CHINA.

01:13:56 CHINA'S COMMUNIST PARTY PLUNGING STEPS TO BOOST THE

01:14:00 ECONOMY WITH THE BUREAU MEETING REPORTEDLY UNDERWAY THIS WEEK

01:14:08 SAYING IT WILL DRAFT A LIST OF THINGS INCLUDING ADJUSTING

01:14:10 PROPERTY POLICIES. TOM:

01:14:16 MAY HAVE TO LISTEN CLOSELY TO LEGITIMATE CHINA EXPERTS.

01:14:18 A LOT OF MOVING PARTS HERE. I HAVE NO IDEA WHICH WAY THIS

01:14:22 GOES.

01:14:28 HENRY KISSINGER TRAVELS OVER AND THESE ARE ALL DISTRACTIONS.

01:14:32 I WANT TO TALK TO CHINA EXPERTS ABOUT WHAT THEY SEE

01:14:33 DOMESTICALLY ON THE GROUND. THE BASIC IDEA IS THE MIX OF IT

01:14:41 IS THE SAME CONCERNS YOU SEE AMONG THE LEADERS AROUND

01:14:42 PRESIDENT XI. JONATHAN: PICK A BANK, ANY BANK, THAT

01:14:47 BANK PROBABLY DOWNGRADED GROWTH FOR CHINA.

01:14:50 THEY SET THE TARGET THAT IT IS ACHIEVABLE IF THEY GET STIMULUS

01:14:54 OUT OF THE COUNTRY. MAYBE WE GOT A HINT OF THAT

01:14:57 THIS MORNING. EUROPE NEEDS IT.

01:15:01 DATA FROM THE EUROZONE COMING IN MUCH COOLER THAN EXPECTED

01:15:08 THIS MORNING.

01:15:09 THESE PMI'S, MANUFACTURING, SERVICES, THAT DROPPED TO THE

01:15:13 LOWEST RATE SINCE DECEMBER. EUROPE AND THE EUROZONE NOT

01:15:14 ALONE. WE HAVE THIS REALLY INTRIGUING

01:15:19 DYNAMIC NOW. THE EURO ZONE DOWN WITH THE ECB

01:15:23 SET TO HIKE. THE U.K. WITH DISAPPOINTING DATA AND THE

01:15:28 BOE SET TO HIKE. TOM: THE DATA IS EVERYTHING HERE.

01:15:34 THE ANSWER IS I LOOK AT AMERICA AND THE BIDEN STIMULUS IF YOU

01:15:37 WANT TO CALL AT THAT, AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE EU

01:15:38 STIMULUS IS. THERE IS THE STIMULUS OF THE

01:15:42 WAR BUT I DON'T BUY IT BECAUSE THERE IS A U.S.

01:15:44 CONTRIBUTION THERE. I GO BACK TO WHEN WE TALK TO

01:15:51 THE FORMER OF ITALY AND HE WAS REALLY, REALLY CAUTIOUS ABOUT

01:15:53 EURO ENTHUSIASM. JONATHAN: JUST TO GO THROUGH THE CALENDAR

01:15:59 FOR THE CENTRAL BANK DECISIONS, THE FEDERAL RESERVE ON

01:16:02 WEDNESDAY, THE ECB COMING UP ON THURSDAY, THE BOJ ON FRIDAY.

01:16:06 AUGUST 3 FOR THE BANK OF ENGLAND.

01:16:08 ON THE SAME BAY AFTER THE CLOSE, YOU WILL HEAR FROM APPLE.

01:16:11 REPORTING THIS MORNING ON IPHONE SHIPMENTS, THE COMPANY

01:16:15 ATTEMPTING TO KEEP THEM STEADY COMPARED TO THE NUMBERS FROM

01:16:18 LAST YEAR DESPITE WHAT WE ARE SEEING ABROAD.

01:16:20 CHINA AND EUROPE SLOWING DOWN. THE TECH GIANT IS ASKING TO

01:16:25 PRODUCE 85 MILLION UNITS OF THE IPHONE 15 THIS YEAR.

01:16:29 THAT IS THE SAME NUMBER AS LAST YEAR.

01:16:33 BUT ULTIMATELY, REVENUE CAN INCREASE BECAUSE THEY ARE

01:16:34 LOOKING TO PUSH UP THE PRICE OF THE PRO.

01:16:38 YOU GET THE AVERAGE SELLING PRICE HIGHER AND KEEP SHIPMENTS

01:16:39 STEADY. TOM:

01:16:46 THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHERS OUT THERE THAT QUESTION THE MARKET

01:16:49 PERSISTENCY WITH THE REVENUE STATEMENT AND WHAT THEY WILL DO

01:16:51 WITH THE MARGINS. THE MARGINS WILL ERODE.

01:16:57 YOU HEARD IT ALL BEFORE, BUT

01:17:04 THE ANSWER IS ON A REVENUE BASIS, UNITS AND PRICE.

01:17:10 JONATHAN: THE PRICE IS UP 50% YEAR TO

01:17:11 DATE ON APPLE. WE TALKED SO MUCH ABOUT NVIDIA,

01:17:15 META. THE LIKES OF APPLE, THINK OF

01:17:21 HOW MUCH MARKET CAP THERE IS TO DATE. TOM:

01:17:25 MY TAKE IS TO COMPARE TO INTEL WHERE IT WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL.

01:17:29 INTEL RAN INTO LARGER STRATEGIC CHALLENGES.

01:17:33 APPLE SEEMS TO BE USING DIVIDEND CASH AND GROWTH BUT

01:17:38 DOING IT IN A PROFITABILITY CYCLE THAT SEEMS TO ENDURE.

01:17:41 DON'T ASK ME WHAT WILL BE IN 2026. YOU MENTIONED 85 MILLION

01:17:45 IPHONES. 84 MILLION AIRPODS UNDERNEATH

01:17:50 THE COUCH AT HOME. DO THEY MAKE MONEY ON THEM?

01:17:56 JONATHAN: IF IT WAS A SEPARATE COMPANY,

01:17:57 IT WOULD BE PRETTY BIG. THEY DON'T WORK FOR YOU? TOM:

01:18:01 THEY DON'T FIT. JONATHAN: I THOUGHT YOU COULD GET

01:18:03 ADJUSTMENTS. TOM: THEY DON'T WORK. JONATHAN:

01:18:06 THEY DON'T WORK FOR YOU BUT THEY WORK FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE.

01:18:08 TOM: THIS IS A JOINT. RIGHT NOW, EARL DAVIS WILL JOIN

01:18:13 US. HE HAS A WONDERFUL CANADIAN

01:18:21 PEDIGREE OUT OF WESTERN ONTARIO, WHICH IS ITSELF ITS

01:18:24 OWN STATISTICAL AND ECONOMIC EXCELLENCE.

01:18:28 THE ONTARIO TEACHERS PENSION PLAN.

01:18:31 AT ONE POINT, THEY OWNED THE TORONTO MAPLE LEAFS.

01:18:35 THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH RETAINING OWNERSHIP OF THE NEW

01:18:39 YORK YANKEES. SOMEONE HAS SEEN IT ALL AND

01:18:41 JOINS US NOW WITH THE MARKABLE RESEARCH.

01:18:45 -- WITH REMARKABLE RESEARCH. THE HEADLINE NUMBER IS YOU LOOK

01:18:51 AND CONSIDER 8% INTEREST RATES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.

01:18:54 OK, THAT GIVES EVERYBODY TO SIT UP STRAIGHT.

01:18:58 CAN YOU FRAME OUT 6% INTEREST RATES IN THE UNITED STATES OF

01:18:59 AMERICA?

01:19:01 >> YEAH.

01:19:07 TO BE SPECIFIC, THE 6% IS ON THE SHORT END.

01:19:11 I THINK IT IS CAPPED AT SIX SENT OVERNIGHT IN THE RECENT --

01:19:17 I THINK OVERNIGHT IS CAPPED AT 6%, AND THE REASON WHY IT IS

01:19:20 ALL OF THE CENTRAL BANKS ARE INDEPENDENT.

01:19:23 YOU ARE GOING TO GET A LOT A BACKLASH.

01:19:25 BACKLASH FROM THE POPULATION. BACKLASH FROM A BUT'S.

01:19:31 TO STAVE OFF THAT BACKLASH, YOU NEED POLITICAL BACKING.

01:19:34 YOU NEED YOUR SENIOR POLITICIANS TO SAY WE HAVE NO

01:19:37 CHOICE BUT TO GO THERE. YOU DON'T GET THAT DURING THE

01:19:40 SECOND HALF. YOU GET THAT AT THE BEGINNING

01:19:44 AS REAGAN PROVED. THAT WAS THE KEY TO STOPPING

01:19:48 INFLATION IN THE 1980'S. I AM NOT SAYING WE ARE DOING

01:19:52 LIKE WE DID IN THE 1980'S BUT TO FIGHT THE BACKLASH, YOU NEED

01:19:54 THAT BACKING. WE HAVE SEEN THIS AS A HARD CAP

01:19:59 AT 6% AT LEAST UNTIL THE NEXT ELECTION CYCLE. TOM:

01:20:02 WHAT DO YOU DO WITH DURATION THEN? YOU DON'T BUY THE EXTEND

01:20:06 DURATION. YOU GET THE INTEREST RATE TO

01:20:09 HELP YOU OUT ALONG THE WAY. WHERE ARE YOU WITH ASSET

01:20:17 MANAGEMENT ON THE EXTENSION OF MATURITY?

01:20:22 >> YEAH, WE ARE HESITANT TO EXTEND MATURITY NOW.

01:20:27 WE THINK 2024 WILL BE THE YEAR TO EXTEND MATURITY.

01:20:28 WE LOOK AT THE MARKET OF SAFETY. IF YOU TAKE YOUR SOVEREIGN BOND

01:20:34 YIELD AND AT A CORPORATE YIELD, HOW MANY MONTHS OR YEARS OF

01:20:36 PROTECTION DO YOU HAVE IF YOU GET 100 BASIS POINTS?

01:20:41 RIGHT NOW, IF YOU HAVE A THREE-YEAR PORTFOLIO OF

01:20:45 CORPORATE AND SOVEREIGN BONDS AND YOU GET 100 BASIS POINTS

01:20:47 INSTANTANEOUS SHOCK, YOU WILL MAKE THAT MONEY BACK WITHIN A

01:20:50 YEAR. THAT HASN'T HAPPENED ONCE YOU

01:20:51 START GOING BEYOND FIVE YEARS DURATION.

01:20:55 WE THINK THE POINT TO EXTEND DURATION IS NOT FAR AWAY FROM A

01:20:57 TIMING PERSPECTIVE. WE BELIEVE WE WILL SEE PEAK 10

01:21:07 YEAR RATES AND POSSIBLY Q4 OF THIS YEAR BUT MORE LIKELY Q1 OF

01:21:09 2024. THAT WILL BE THE OPPORTUNITY OF

01:21:10 A LIFETIME. TOM: ARE THERE SHADOWS FROM DEPOSITS

01:21:15 TO HIGHER YIELDS AND MONEY MARKET FUNDS?

01:21:17 WE HAVE ALL BEEN THERE AND I DON'T WANT TO GET TO HYSTERIA

01:21:22 BUT DO YOU SEE SHADOWS IN THE SYSTEM OR IS THERE A LOT OF

01:21:26 TRANSPARENCY ON THE RESILIENCY OF YIELD IN MONEY MARKET FUNDS?

01:21:30 >> YOU ARE TOUCHING ON A LOT OF THINGS HERE.

01:21:35 FROM A YIELD PERSPECTIVE, CASH IS NOW AN ASSET CLASS.

01:21:39 A YEAR AGO OR TWO YEARS AGO, CACHE WAS NOT AN ASSET CLASS.

01:21:43 EARNING TWO BASIS POINTS IF YOU ARE LUCKY.

01:21:47 RIGHT NOW, YOU ARE EARNING ON CASH 5%.

01:21:51 THAT IS VERY ATTRACTIVE FROM AN ASSET CLASS.

01:21:54 GOING BACK TO THE OTHER QUESTION IN REGARDS TO

01:21:56 FINANCIAL STABILITY, THAT IS OF THE UTMOST CONCERN FROM A

01:22:00 CENTRAL BANKER'S PERSPECTIVE. WE BELIEVE THE MARKET IS VERY

01:22:02 RESILIENT. WE BELIEVE WE ARE PAST THE

01:22:08 POINT AT LEAST IN THIS POINT OF TIME OF FINANCIAL RESILIENCY

01:22:12 BECAUSE YOUR BIGGEST BANKS, BIGGEST INVESTMENT BANKS ARE

01:22:15 EVEN SAFER NOW THAN THEY WERE THREE MONTH AGO WITH ALL THE

01:22:19 FACILITIES BROUGHT IN AFTER SVB AND THE LIKE.

01:22:23 WE THINK THE FINANCIAL MARKET IS VERY STABLE HERE FROM A

01:22:29 FINANCIAL STABILITY PERSPECTIVE. THERE ARE NO WORRIES THERE.

01:22:32 WE LIKE CASH AS PART OF THE MIX BECAUSE IT IS A NEW ASSET CLASS

01:22:35 AND IT IS GIVING YOU INFLATION AT LEAST FOR THE SHORT TERM

01:22:38 TIME SO IT MEANS YOU ARE EARNING A REAL DOLLAR. JONATHAN:

01:22:41 THERE IS A REINVESTMENT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THAT.

01:22:45 CAN WE HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT YOUR CONVERSATIONS WITH CLIENTS

01:22:46 SOUND LIKE? PERHAPS THE RATE CYCLE IS

01:22:52 AROUND THE CORNER AND THEY WANT TO LOCK THE STUFF IN LONGER

01:22:53 THAN THREE MONTHS OR 12 MONTHS. WHAT ARE YOU TELLING THEM?

01:23:00 >> WE THINK IT IS A GREAT INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY.

01:23:05 WHY WE SAY THAT IS PART OF THE SEQUENCING OF LOWER YIELDS,

01:23:06 FIRST YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR RISK ASSETS TO SELL OFF THAT WILL BE

01:23:11 THE BIG TRIGGER TO GET YOU LOWER YIELDS.

01:23:14 IF YOU ARE IN CASH NOW AND YOUR RISK ASSETS, EQUITIES, CREDIT

01:23:17 BONDS SELL OFF OF YOU COULD GO FROM CASHING TO RISK ASSETS, SO

01:23:19 THAT IS ONE KEY THING. NOW I WILL GO BACK TO YOUR

01:23:23 QUESTION DIRECTLY ABOUT DURATION.

01:23:26 PEOPLE ARE IN FIXED INCOME FOR TWO REASONS.

01:23:30 ONE IS THE YIELD AND THE COUPON. THE OTHER IS THE FLIGHT TO

01:23:33 SAFETY INSURANCE PLAN. AS YOU SAID, RATES START GOING

01:23:38 DOWN, YOU GET CAPITAL GAINS. RIGHT NOW, WE ARE NOT AT THE

01:23:42 LEVEL WHERE YOU GET ADEQUATE CAPITAL GAINS.

01:23:43 YOU GET ADEQUATE YIELD. WE BELIEVE THAT WILL BE Q4 OF

01:23:49 THIS YEAR OR Q1 OF 2024 AND THAT IS WHEN WE EXTEND OUT

01:23:53 DURATIONS TO GET YIELD AND THE CAPITAL APPRECIATION IN THE

01:23:56 RISK OFF MOMENTS. JONATHAN: INTERESTING. THAT WAS GREAT.

01:23:57 THANK YOU FOR TOUCHING BASE. ON THIS BOND MARKET RIGHT NOW.

01:24:04 CASH HAS BECOME AN ASSET CLASS THIS YEAR IN A BIG WAY.

01:24:07 IT WAS FAVORABLE OF 5%. I JUST MEMBER THAT INTERVIEW

01:24:16 WITH THE TEAM HERE AT BLOOMBERG WITH MORGAN STANLEY WHEN HE

01:24:18 SAID YOU WILL GET TO THE THIRD QUARTER INTO FOUR AND PEOPLE

01:24:22 WHO ARE IN CASH AT 5% AND MISSED OUT ON THE MASSIVE GAINS

01:24:26 IN THE EQUITY MARKET WILL START TO FEEL PRESSURE TO DEPLOY IT.

01:24:30 THAT TIMELINE HAS COME ALL THE WAY IN FROM THE FIRST QUARTER

01:24:34 OUT TO SEPTEMBER ALL THE WAY. TOM:

01:24:37 NORMAL RATIONAL BEHAVIOR IN ANY KIND OF BULL MARKET.

01:24:43 THERE IS A FIRST LEG IN OCTOBER AND MAYBE A SECOND LEG IN LATE

01:24:48 MAY, THE BROADENING OF THE SECOND LEG OF A BULL MARKET.

01:24:52 BUT I WOULD FOCUS ON THE CALENDAR GETTING TO THE END OF

01:24:55 THE YEAR WITH PEOPLE BEHIND. IF YOU ARE UP 7% IN AN EQUITY

01:25:01 PORTFOLIO, YOU CAN SAY I GUESS THEY WOULD BE CASH, BUT WHAT

01:25:06 ARE YOUR CUSTOMERS THINKING, YOUR CLIENTS, YOUR

01:25:09 SHAREHOLDERS, WHATEVER THE RELATIONSHIP IS? JONATHAN:

01:25:13 WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM PERMIT EQUITY FEATURES ON THE S&P 500

01:25:16 JUST ABOUT POSITIVE BY 0.16%. COMING UP AT 8:30 EASTERN TIME,

01:25:23 WE WILL CATCH UP WITH THE CHIEF ECONOMIST AT NATIONWIDE.

01:25:26 A KIWI FOR CHAIRMAN POWELL AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE FOR

01:25:30 CHRISTINE LAGARDE AND THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK ON

01:25:34 WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY RESPECTIVELY. TOM:

01:25:40 THAT INVENTORY BUILD GIVING HI NORMA'S NUMBER -- GIVING A BIG

01:25:44 NUMBER. WE WILL GET AN UPDATE ON THAT

01:25:50 AS WELL. EARL DAVIS I THOUGHT WAS GREAT

01:25:55 THERE WITH THE STATE OF YIELDS.

01:25:58 THE ONTARIO TEACHERS PENSION PLAN, THEY OWNED THE TORONTO

01:26:02 MAPLE LEAFS. THEY MAKE FOUR TIMES THEIR

01:26:05 MONEY WHEN THEY SOLD THAT. IT IS AMAZING, THE MONEY IN

01:26:07 SPORTS. JONATHAN: INCREDIBLE, THE DEMAND FOR IT.

01:26:12 TOM: A PENSION PLAN MADE FOUR TIMES

01:26:13 THEIR MONEY. JONATHAN: HAVE YOU SEEN THE STORY THIS

01:26:17 MORNING THAT A SAUDI ARABIAN CLUB HAS MADE A BID FOR MBAPPE?

01:26:22 TOM: IN THE NEWS THIS WEEKEND. JONATHAN:

01:26:25 HE IS IN A CONTRACT DISPUTE WITH PSG.

01:26:31 PSG, MBAPPE HAS AGREED WITH THE REAL MADRID AND WANTS TO LEAVE

01:26:33 FOR FREE NEXT SUMMER. TOM: WHO IS DRIVING THE BUS HERE?

01:26:37 JONATHAN: PSG IS PUTTING HIM UP FOR SALE.

01:26:45 THIS CLUB BID $332 MILLION FOR MBAPPE, WHICH IS AN

01:26:46 UNBELIEVABLE SUM OF MONEY. TOM: DOES THE PLAYER HAVE ANY

01:26:50 CONTROL OF THIS DEBATE, THIS DISCUSSION? JONATHAN:

01:26:54 HE HAS A YEAR LEFT ON HIS CONTRACT.

01:26:55 12 MONTHS LEFT AND THIS DISPUTE WILL GO THROUGH SEVERAL WEEKS

01:26:58 THROUGH THE REST OF THIS TRANSFER WINDOW I IMAGINE. TOM:

01:27:03 MBAPPE WAS THE GUY WHO WENT DOWN THE FIELD.

01:27:04 HE JUST GOES DOWN. JONATHAN: VERY FAST. TOM: DOWN THE FIELD.

01:27:14 FOOTBALL TALK. JONATHAN: THAT IS THE LATEST ON FOOTBALL

01:27:16 TALK.

01:27:33 >> OF COURSE THE EQUITY MARKET HAS LARGELY BEEN DRIVEN BY THE

01:27:37 TECH STOCKS, AND THERE ARE GOOD REASONS FOR WHY THAT HAS

01:27:40 OCCURRED. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ARE

01:27:42 INVESTING IN GROWTH STOCKS, IT IS ABOUT THE FUTURE AND TAKING

01:27:46 A VIEW ON HOW DEMANDING VALUATIONS ARE FOR WHAT IS

01:27:49 EXPECTED OF THESE COMPANIES. WE HAVE NOT SEEN VALUATIONS

01:27:55 WITH THIS DEMAND SINCE THE LATE 1990'S. JONATHAN:

01:27:58 THE DWS GROUP CIO THERE. WE WILL GET A LOOK AT THE PAST

01:28:04 WHEN WE GET TECH EARNINGS FROM SOME OF THE MAJOR PLAYERS ON

01:28:06 THE S&P 500 AND THE NASDAQ. AND THAT WILL FINISH WITH APPLE

01:28:10 NEXT THURSDAY. NOT THIS THURSDAY BUT NEXT

01:28:12 THURSDAY. THE EQUITY MARKET RIGHT NOW ON

01:28:16 THE S&P 500 SLIGHTLY POSITIVE 5.2%.

01:28:18 A LIFT LAST WEEK, JUST IN THE NO ONE.

01:28:21 WE ADD SOME WEIGHT TO THE RALLY THIS WEEK. 380 ON THE 10 YEAR.

01:28:26 3.7937. DATA IN EUROPE AND THE U.K.

01:28:29 UNDERWHELMING.

01:28:36 MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE DATA SURPRISING ACROSS THE CONTINENT.

01:28:39 TOM: STARTING WITH GERMAN MANUFACTURING, WHAT DOES IT SAY

01:28:42 ABOUT THE SERVICE SECTOR IN EUROPE?

01:28:48 BUT BEYOND AMERICAN TOURISTS WALKING AROUND IN THE HEAT,

01:28:50 WHAT ELSE IS THERE? JONATHAN: IN THE U.S., WE WERE TALKING

01:28:58 ABOUT IF MANAGERS WOULD CONVERGE BUT IN EUROPE IT IS

01:28:59 THE OTHER DIRECTION. TOM: SEEING GOOD DISINFLATION AND

01:29:03 DEFLATION OUT THERE. WE WILL GET RIGHT INTO IT.

01:29:10 A SENIOR TECH ANALYST FOR BLOOMBERG INTELLIGENCE.

01:29:12 I HAVE A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS ON LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS.

01:29:18 LET'S GO TO SMALL LETTER MODELS OVER THE WEEKEND AND OVERNIGHT.

01:29:22 FROM TWITTER TO X TO WHAT? WHERE IS X HEADING?

01:29:28 >> I THINK HE IS THINKING OF FOLDING TWITTER INTO HIS FAMILY

01:29:34 OF APPS.

01:29:35 CLEARLY, HE IS TRYING TO LIVE -- LEVERAGE TWITTER. TOM:

01:29:39 HE IS TRYING TO CATCH UP WITH THREADS?

01:29:42 >> I THINK IN THE PROCESS, HE HAS DAMAGED THE BRAND.

01:29:45 TWITTER AS A BRAND HAD A LOT OF VALUE, WHICH IS WHY HE ENDED UP

01:29:49 PAYING $44 BILLION FOR IT. NOW THE REVENUE IS DOWN 50% AND

01:29:54 HE IS TRYING TO DO SOMETHING BIG BUT NO ONE KNOWS WHAT

01:29:57 BECAUSE CLEARLY HE DOESN'T HAVE THE CREDENTIALS OF THE TECH

01:30:01 COMPANY, AND THE PLAY HERE IS DATA.

01:30:04 HE THINKS TWITTER'S DATA IS INVALUABLE. TOM:

01:30:06 YOU ARE THE EXPERT.

01:30:10 >> I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE POPULARITY OF THREADS AFTER

01:30:15 WEEK ONE, IT HAS GONE DOWN SIMPLY BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE

01:30:17 FINDING IT HARD TO SWITCH TO THE NEW PLATFORM THAT HAS LARGE

01:30:20 AMOUNTS OF DATA. JONATHAN: WE ARE PART OF THE PLATFORM,

01:30:24 NOT THE ONLY ONES. WE WANT TO SEE HIM SUCCEED.

01:30:30 WHEN DO THEY START TO KNOCK HIM AND WE START OF YOUR SERIOUS

01:30:32 CONCERN ABOUT THE DIRECTION OF THE BUSINESS?

01:30:36 >> AS LONG AS TESLA'S STOCK IS HOLDING UP WELL, HE IS FINE

01:30:39 BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE LAST SIX MONTHS IS TESLA'S

01:30:43 STOCK HAS COME UP QUITE A BIT.

01:30:49 THAT IS WHAT IS SOOTHING THE CREDITORS.

01:30:53 IN TWITTER'S CASE, EVERYONE KNOWS THE COMPANY IS PRIVATE

01:30:57 AND WILL GO THROUGH A COMPLETE MAKEOVER.

01:30:59 WHAT SORT OF MAKEOVER IT WILL BECOME A NO ONE HAS AN IDEA.

01:31:04 JONATHAN: YOU HAVE SOME OPTIONS WHEN YOU

01:31:07 ARE PRIVATE. I UNDERSTAND THAT. ONE OF THE OPTIONS IS TO GO

01:31:11 DOWN THE FINANCIAL ROUTE TO BECOME A BANK NOT IN THE

01:31:13 TRADITIONAL SENSE BUT INCLUDE SOME KIND OF BANKING.

01:31:17 HOW DIFFICULT IS IT TO EXECUTE THAT VISION?

01:31:21 >> VERY DIFFICULT GIVEN HE IS COMPLETELY TAKING AWAY THE

01:31:24 BRAND VALUE AND REBRANDING TO SOMETHING THAT NOBODY KNOWS.

01:31:27 I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY PRECEDENT WE CAN OFFER THAT HE

01:31:31 WILL BE SUCCESSFUL. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, YOU CAN

01:31:34 GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR AT LEAST HAVING A VISION IN TERMS OF

01:31:39 WHAT HE WANTS TO DO.

01:31:41 HE WAS EARLY IN AUTONOMOUS DRIVING AND WHAT HE IS DOING

01:31:42 WITH TESLA AS A CAR. HE COULD BE ONTO SOMETHING.

01:31:48 THAT IS WHAT EVERY COMPANY IS TALKING ABOUT.

01:31:50 THAT IS WHAT APPLE EVEN MENTIONED.

01:31:54 THEY NEVER TALKED ABOUT THESE BUZZWORDS LIKE METAVERSE. TOM:

01:32:00 AS I LOOK AT THE WE COULD BE A

01:32:05 PAGE FOR LARGE -- THEY USE CORPORA FOR

01:32:09 CORPORATIONS. THIS IS TECH BABBLE RIGHT NOW.

01:32:13 WHAT IN GODS NAME IS A LARGE LINK WHICH MODEL, AND WHY DO I

01:32:14 CARE?

01:32:17 >> A LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL USES PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING OUT

01:32:20 THERE ON THE INTERNET. TOM: WIKIPEDIA, CONTINUE.

01:32:27 >> WHAT COMPANIES REALIZE IS IT IS VALUE AND THEY DON'T WANT IT

01:32:31 TO BE SCRAPED FOR THE MODELS WHICH CAN BECOME VERY

01:32:32 INTELLIGENT CHATBOTS. WE WERE GIVEN A GLIMPSE LAST

01:32:35 WEEK. THEY CALLED OUT THIS SPECIFIC

01:32:37 AREA. SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANIES ARE

01:32:42 ALWAYS EARLY IN TERMS OF WATCHING DEMAND.

01:32:46 THIS SEGMENT, OVER 50%. TOM: IT WILL BE DECIDED IN COURTS

01:32:52 WHERE SOMEONE SAYS GENERAL MOTORS SAYS WE HAVE A COPYRIGHT

01:32:58 ON THIS BODY, THIS DATA, IS THAT WHERE WE ARE HEADED?

01:33:01 >> I THINK EVERY COMPANY WILL BECOME VERY PROTECTIVE ABOUT

01:33:02 THEIR DATA. THEY WILL ALLOW MINIMAL DATA TO

01:33:06 BE SCRAPED BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT IS FEEDING THE LARGE LINK WHICH

01:33:12 MODELS. THE NEXT THING WOULD BE WHO

01:33:16 OWNS THE BEST DATA, AND THAT IS WHERE SENTIMENT IS NEGATIVE ON

01:33:19 ALPHABET OR THE INTERNET COMPANIES, BECAUSE THEY HAVE

01:33:20 THE BEST DATA. JONATHAN: ALPHABET REPORT TOMORROW.

01:33:25 WEDNESDAY, THE FOCUS WILL BE ON CHAIRMAN POWELL.

01:33:28 IF YOU CAN STAY AWAKE AFTER HIS CONFERENCE, YOU CAN HEAR FROM

01:33:30 META. IS THREADS GETTING IT DONE?

01:33:35 >> NO, I DON'T THINK SO. WHEN IT COMES TO ENGAGEMENT,

01:33:41 YOU SEE THE PATTERN, THE FIRST FEW PATTERNS CAN BE OVERCOME

01:33:44 AND THAT IS WHERE IT COMES TO TOM'S QUESTION.

01:33:47 HE MUST FEEL THAT TWITTER'S DATA IS VALUABLE AND HE CAN DO

01:33:50 MUCH WITH IT. NOW IT IS ABOUT WHETHER THIS

01:33:53 COMPANY CAN GROW ENGAGEMENT. THEY HAVE SOME VALUABLE DATA.

01:34:01 THAT IS WHAT THE SUITE. IS BETTING ON I JONATHAN:

01:34:06 -- THAT IS WHAT THE SUITE IS BETTING ON. JONATHAN:

01:34:17 I THOUGHT A TWEET -- I SAW A TWEET ABOUT PEOPLE LAUGHING AT

01:34:19 X.

01:34:21 >> IT IS A FAMILY OF APPS. THEY DON'T WANT TO FOCUS ON ONE

01:34:26 BECAUSE THAT MAKES THE REGULATORY OCCASION STRONGER.

01:34:29 TOM: IS YOUR WORLD MATURING?

01:34:35 ARE THESE TECH GUYS WHETHER BRILLIANT OR LUCKY OR BOTH,

01:34:37 THEY STRUCK LIGHTNING ONCE OR TWICE, THREE TIMES, SOME OF

01:34:41 THEM FAILED WITH GREAT RESPECT, BUT THE ANSWER IS, ARE THESE

01:34:42 CLOWNS MATURING?

01:34:44 >> I THINK SO. LOOK AT THE SPEED IN WHICH

01:34:47 INCUMBENTS ARE CHANGING. SOME MAY ARGUE THAT GOOGLE IS

01:34:51 NOT CHANGING FAST ENOUGH. BUT FOR THE MOST PART, THESE

01:34:54 CUP NEEDS ARE CHANGING. THEY ARE TRYING TO CATCH THE

01:34:58 NEXT WAY, WHETHER IT IS THE CLOUD OR AI.

01:35:00 THAT IS THE BENEFIT. TOM: WHAT IS THE NEXT WAVE OF X?

01:35:09 >> LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS AND GENERATED AI -- GENERATIVE AI.

01:35:16 TOM: TWITTER IN MY SINK OPINION IS

01:35:18 NOT WORTH ANYTHING. TWITTER HAS DRAMATICALLY

01:35:24 DECLINED IN USABILITY AND PROFITABILITY. IT IS PAINFUL.

01:35:27 >> THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RETAIN THEIR CREATORS IN

01:35:28 CERTAIN SEGMENTS. I AGREE WITH YOUR ASSESSMENT

01:35:34 THE ADS ARE PRETTY BAD AND YOU DON'T WANT TO LOOK AT THEM, BUT

01:35:38 IF YOU ASK THE CREATORS, THEY THINK THEY GET THE FOLLOWING AN

01:35:39 ENGAGEMENT RIGHT NOW. IT WILL TAKE YEARS.

01:35:46 THREADS WILL NOT CATCH UP OVERNIGHT AND DISPLAYS TWITTER.

01:35:50 IF THIS HAPPENS, IT WILL HAPPEN SLOWLY AND THERE ARE MISSTEPS

01:35:51 THAT TWITTER IS MAKING. JONATHAN:

01:35:53 WHAT DO WE CALL TWITTER NOW? WHAT ARE THEY CALLED?

01:36:00 ON TWITTER, WHAT ARE THEY ON X?

01:36:03 >> THREAD, THAT IS THE NAME, RIGHT? THREAD. JONATHAN:

01:36:09 DID YOU WATCH IT OVER THE WEEKEND?

01:36:13 >> I THINK IT IS AN AMAZING MOVIE AND CLEARLY THERE IS A

01:36:17 LOT AND HOW THEY UNPACKAGED THEIR STUFF AND WHAT THEY DID

01:36:19 IN TERMS OF ADVERTISING IT AHEAD OF TIME.

01:36:21 THAT IS WHAT GENERATED THE EXCITEMENT. JONATHAN:

01:36:23 IT IS TRUE.

01:36:25 >> IN THE END, IT TURNED OUT TO BE GREAT.

01:36:29 THAT IS WHAT PROMPTED ME TO WATCH IT, THE ADVERTISING.

01:36:30 JONATHAN: THERE WAS ONE POINT WHERE THE

01:36:34 MARKETING OF THE MOVIE, I THOUGHT IT WAS OUT AND HAD BEEN

01:36:35 OUT. THANK YOU. TOM: MOVIE CRITIC. JONATHAN:

01:36:42 BIG WEEK OF TECH EARNINGS AND OUR RESIDENT MOVIE CRITIC AS

01:36:45 WELL ON "BARBIE"

01:36:51 AND "ARPIN HEIMER DESK AND "OPPENHEIMER -- "OPPENHEIMER."

01:36:56 JONATHAN: "BARBIE" YOU CAN WATCH WHAT YOU ARE

01:36:58 BORED, NOT SURE WHAT YOU WOULD GO TO THE THEATERS.

01:37:02 "OPPENHEIMER," I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO GO TO THE

01:37:04 WOULD-BE THEATER TO EXPERIENCE. THAT IS MY TAKE. TOM:

01:37:07 IT IS BIZARRE. JONATHAN: LEADERSHIP.

01:37:11 I LOVE THE INSIDE STORY. ARE YOU TELLING ME THE CEO WAS

01:37:18 ON BOARD WITH THAT, THE HAPHAZARD ABRUPT? TOM:

01:37:23 WE WILL FIND OUT ONCE HE SEES "OPPENHEIMER." JONATHAN:

01:37:27 IF YOU WANT TO SAY IT, YOU HAVE 10 SECONDS TO SAY IT. [LAUGHTER]

01:37:30 >> I DON'T KNOW. I THINK RIGHT NOW SHE IS JUST

01:37:35 FOLLOWING WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. JONATHAN:

01:37:39 THAT IS WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD FROM NEW YORK CITY,

01:37:53 >> IT'S A FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT. IF YOU CAN BETTER -- BATTLE

01:37:59 INFLATION WITHOUT BOWING -- BLOWING UP THE SYSTEM.

01:38:02 >> THE FED DOESN'T WANT TO CHANGE AS LONG ROOM ESTIMATE OF

01:38:05 WHERE THE FED FUNDS RATE IS.

01:38:08 >> I THINK THE FED WILL COME ACROSS AS DOVISH.

01:38:10 >> WE EXPECT A SMALL RECESSION.

01:38:13 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE. TOM:

01:38:22 GOOD MORNING, ON RADIO AND TELEVISION, MONDAY TOWARD AN

01:38:27 EVENTFUL 12 DAYS. AFTER THURSDAY NEXT WEEK, IT'S

01:38:29 ABOUT HER EARNINGS. IT'S ALSO ABOUT CENTRAL BANKS.

01:38:36 I THINK YOU CAN CONFLATE BOTH OF THEM TOGETHER, EARNINGS AND

01:38:37 CENTRAL BANKS. JONATHAN: WE'VE GOT THIS SWEET SPOT WHERE

01:38:44 JOBS GROWTH IS STILL PRETTY GOOD AND MOST PEOPLE THINK THE

01:38:47 FEDERAL RESERVE MIGHT WANT TO DUMP BUT I DON'T THINK CHAIRMAN

01:38:52 POWELL IS SAYING THE SAME. AFTER GETTING BURNED EARLIER

01:38:58 THIS YEAR, THE FOMC WANTS TO REPEAT THE ACT.

01:39:03 THE NOTES INDICATE THE MAJORITY OF THE COMMITTEE ARE LOOKING

01:39:04 FOR ONE OR TWO HIKES THIS YEAR. MOST PEOPLE ANTICIPATE THIS

01:39:10 INTO WEDNESDAY AND THEY WANT TO RETAIN THE OPTION TO MOVE AGAIN

01:39:13 IF THEY NEED TO AND BETWEEN NOW AND SOME TEMPER, YOU HAVE A YOU

01:39:14 MORE INFLATION PRINTS. TOM: WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS

01:39:19 TO ME.

01:39:26 THERE IS A LEVELING OUT OF GROWTH.

01:39:33 BRAMO IS OFF SOMEWHERE AND YOU LOOK AT THE NORWEGIAN REAL GDP

01:39:36 GROWTH AND SCANDINAVIA AND THAT'S WHAT CHRISTINE LAGARDE

01:39:43 HAS TO CONFRONT IS THE LEVEL PRE-PANDEMIC BUT THERE IS A

01:39:46 LEVELING IN EUROPE THAT THERE IS NOT IN THE UNITED STATES.

01:39:51 JONATHAN: MANUFACTURING DATA IN EUROPE

01:39:54 WAS TERRIBLE. YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT.

01:39:56 EUROPE IS FAR MORE INTERESTING THAN THE FEDERAL RESERVE THIS

01:39:59 WEEK. THE GROWTH BACKDROP AS FAR LESS

01:40:01 RESILIENT. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S DEVELOPING IN EUROPE, AND ECB

01:40:07 IS HIKING INTO WEAKNESS. IF YOU ASK WALL STREET WHETHER

01:40:13 THEY ARE HIKING INTO THE WEAKNESS IN THE U.S., YOU HAVE

01:40:14 MORE OF A SPLIT OK AND YOU AND. THEY ARE HIKING INTO WEAKNESS

01:40:19 BECAUSE INFLATION IS TOO HIGH IN EUROPE.

01:40:21 I REMEMBER GUY JOHNSON SAID IT WEEKS AGO, EUROPE IS

01:40:25 INTERESTING BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT A GROWTH PROBLEM AND INFLATION

01:40:29 IS STILL TOO HIGH FOR THE ECB. THAT'S PRETTY FASCINATING IF

01:40:35 YOU ARE ON THE SIDE WHERE YOU THINK THE FEDERAL RESERVE CAN

01:40:40 ENGINEER A DECELERATION IN INFLATION WITHOUT A RECESSION.

01:40:42 TOM: WHAT WE WILL SEE THIS WEEKEND

01:40:46 EARNINGS, EVERY NATION FOR ITS SELF, EVERY COMPANY IN EVERY

01:40:51 NARRATIVE. MOST IMPORTANT PERSON THIS WEEK

01:40:54 IS JULIAN EMANUEL AT EVERCORE WHO DOES THAT DAILY SOME OF THE

01:40:59 AGGREGATE OF ALL OF THOSE INDIVIDUAL NARRATIVES.

01:41:05 JONATHAN: TECH EARNINGS HAVE GOT TO COME

01:41:07 IN PRETTY STRONG. TESLA LAST WEEK GOT PUNISHED.

01:41:13 TOM: WE CONFLATE TECH AND BIG BUNKS

01:41:18 AND TECH IS MORE IDIOSYNCRATIC THAN ANYTHING I'VE SEEN IN BIG

01:41:22 -- THANKS. JONATHAN: WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SHIPMENTS

01:41:26 OF HARDWARE AT APPLE. TOM: WHAT DID MET ESSAY?

01:41:36 JONATHAN: VICTORY LAPS AT META AND IT

01:41:37 WILL BE ABOUT THE DATA.

01:41:43 THREADS IS OPEN BUT I HAVEN'T USED IT. TOM:

01:41:47 IT WAS PEOPLE PARTYING ALL WEEKEND.

01:41:50 JONATHAN: I'VE GOT NO PROBLEM WITH PEOPLE

01:41:54 PARTYING. TOM: I DON'T WANT IT TO GET INTO

01:41:59 MIGHT TWITTER LIKE ACCOUNT.

01:42:08 BRENT CRUDE, 81.47, NICELY ABOVE $80 PER BARREL. JONATHAN:

01:42:12 EQUITIES ARE SLIGHTLY POSITIVE AND THERE IS A LIFT WITH THE

01:42:15 RALLY IN THE BOND MARKET.

01:42:21 THE 10-YEAR HAS A BREAK OF 3.80. IT'S ON THE BACK OF WEEK DATA

01:42:25 IN EUROPE AND THE U.K.. U.S. PMI COMES OUT IN ABOUT AN HOUR

01:42:29 AND 40 MINUTES. WE WILL BREAK THAT DOWN FOR YOU.

01:42:35 TOM: I AM DEAF ON A 33 YEAR PAID --

01:42:40 33 PAGE MIDYEAR REVIEW.

01:42:51 DEUTSCHE BANK INTERNATIONAL PRIVATE BANK DOES A GREAT JOB

01:42:56 AND THEY ARE PUTTING TOGETHER SOMETHING IN ENGLISH.

01:43:04 HOW DO PUT YOUR NOTE TOGETHER? ALREADY THREE PAGES AND IT'S

01:43:07 ACTUALLY INTERESTING TO READ.

01:43:14 HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY PUT A NOTE TOGETHER TO GET YOUR BELIEF?

01:43:19 >> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION, IT'S A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT

01:43:22 BETWEEN US AND OUR INSTITUTIONAL PARTNERS SO WE

01:43:26 COMBINED FORCES WE TAKE INPUT

01:43:32 FROM GLOBAL MARKETS WE MATCH UP BUT FINALLY, THE INTERNATIONAL

01:43:36 PRIVATE BANK AND DWS COME UP WITH THE FIVE-MONTH FORECAST

01:43:37 FOR THE FINANCIAL MARKETS. TOM: YOUR LOOK DOVETAILS AS GOOD AS

01:43:45 I CAN SEE WITH THE IMF GRIM VIEW OUT TO 2028.

01:43:50 YOU'RE LOOKING FOR GLOBAL GROWTH.

01:43:53 HOW CAN I PARTICIPATE IN THE STANDARD & POOR'S 500 IF I HAVE

01:43:57 A FRAMEWORK WRAPPED AROUND THAT OUTLOOK?

01:44:01 >> IT'S BEEN SAID A FEW TIMES ALREADY TODAY THAT MARKETS AND

01:44:04 ECONOMIES ARE DIFFERENT PLACES.

01:44:10 FROM AN ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVE, WE CAN EXPECT A DECELERATION.

01:44:15 I'M NOT SUGGESTING A SHARP CONTRACTION HERE.

01:44:19 I THINK YOU WILL SEE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THIS YEAR OR

01:44:24 FIRST QUARTER OF NEXT YEAR, A BRIEF RECESSION IN THE U.S.

01:44:28 THAT'S NOT REALLY OUR BASE CASE BUT THERE IS A HIGH PROBABILITY

01:44:29 THAT MIGHT HAPPEN. YOU ARE LOOKING AT AN ECONOMY

01:44:35 THAT REALLY HAS BEEN FIRING ON A LOT OF CYLINDERS.

01:44:39 YOU LOOK AT THE DOT PLOTS FROM JUNE AT THE FED AND FORTH ORDER

01:44:48 OVER FOUR ORDER, 0.9%. JONATHAN: WHERE IS THE EARNINGS GROWTH

01:44:52 GOING TO COME FROM?

01:44:57 >> THE CONSUMER IS QUITE RESILIENT.

01:45:02 SPENDING IS STILL UP AND HIS TURN TO GO UP IN YOUR SEEING

01:45:03 EFFICIENCY GAINS.

01:45:12 THE TROUGH PART OF THE EARNINGS CYCLE, SECOND QUARTER OF THIS

01:45:14 YEAR, MAYBE THE THIRD QUARTER BUT STARTING THE FOURTH

01:45:17 QUARTER, THE COMPS LOOK BETTER. I THINK YOU ARE LOOKING AT

01:45:20 BETTER EARNINGS GOING INTO LATER THIS YEAR IN TERMS OF THE

01:45:23 NEXT YEAR. JONATHAN: ARE YOU LEANING AWAY FROM THE

01:45:28 INDEX LEVEL STORY?

01:45:34 >> PRETTY MUCH, BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO ARGUE AGAINST BIG TECH

01:45:37 FOR THE TIME BEING. IT'S ALSO DIFFICULT TO

01:45:43 RATIONALIZE THE SUSTAINABLE REACTION OF THE TECH MARKET,

01:45:46 HOW BIG CAN BIG TECH GROW? YOU HAVE TO BE A LITTLE BIT

01:45:48 CONSERVATIVE. WE ARE NOT TALKING THAT

01:45:53 CAPITULATION BUT WERE TALK ABOUT CONSOLIDATION SUBMIT VIA

01:46:01 35 AND -- 3-5% PULLBACK GOING INTO LATE SUMMER AND EARLY FALL.

01:46:09 THE GOOD THING IS THAT IF YOU ARE ALREADY INVESTED, THERE IS

01:46:11 NOTHING MUCH TO DO. TOM: YOU STAY INVESTED AND NO ONE IS

01:46:16 RUNNING AROUND SAYING GO TO CASH.

01:46:20 >> STAY INVESTED BUT IF YOU HAVE NEW MONEY TO DEPLOY,

01:46:25 THAT'S WHERE THINGS -- HAVING A BETTER ENTRY POINT MIGHT NOT BE

01:46:26 TO FURTHER OUT.

01:46:33 GIVEN THE THREE-MONTH PEOPLE IS GIVING YOU 5.25 PERCENT, IT'S

01:46:35 NOT A BAD TIME TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF CASH IN THEIR AS YOU

01:46:37 WAIT FOR BETTER ENTRY POINTS.

01:46:47 TOM: THEY HAVE A FIVE COURSE LUNCH

01:46:51 ON WALL STREET AND THEN COME BACK AND LOOK AT THEIR

01:46:58 BLOOMBERG.

01:46:59 JONATHAN: PEOPLE WERE FOOLISH ABOUT

01:47:00 MISSING OUT ON THIS EQUITY RALLY. ARE THEY MORE INCLINED TO

01:47:05 INVEST IN TECH OR GO ELSEWHERE?

01:47:10 >> I THINK CHASING IS NOT THE BEST IDEA GIVEN THE VALUATION

01:47:11 LEVELS. I UNDERSTAND THE PROFITABILITY

01:47:16 FOR BIG TECH WILL BE BETTER THAN THE OVERALL INDEX BUT

01:47:22 VALUATIONS GIVES A PAUSE TO START DEPLOYING NEW MONEY INTO

01:47:23 TECH. I THINK A STRATEGY WHERE YOU

01:47:27 HAVE SOMEWHAT GROWTH ON ONE

01:47:34 SIDE BUT LOOK AT VALUE STOCKS. THAT LOOKS MORE PROMISING ON

01:47:36 EUROPEAN FUNDS. THAT KIND OF A STRATEGY MIGHT

01:47:41 BE THE WAY TO GO. TOM: HOW ABOUT CASH?

01:47:48 WE'RE IS YOUR SHOP RIGHT NOW IN CASH?

01:47:52 >> WE ARE SLIGHTLY OVERWEIGHT CASH COMPARED TO OUR NEUTRAL.

01:47:56 THAT'S PRIMARILY BECAUSE WE ARE WAITING FOR THE FED TO DEPLOY

01:48:02 MONEY. I WOULD SAY CASH EQUIVALENTS

01:48:05 AND PUT INTO ACCOUNT ON A SHORT-TERM CASH MANAGEMENT

01:48:15 TECHNIQUE, NOT SAYING THEY ARE CASH BUT HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:48:17 EXPOSURE.

01:48:18 THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME, YOU'RE GETTING A NICE RETURN ON

01:48:28 THE INVESTMENT.

01:48:30 JONATHAN: LOOKING FOR A BETTER ENTRY

01:48:37 POINT, ABSOLUTELY RIPPED PAST EXPECTATIONS.

01:48:40 LOOKING AT EQUITIES NOW, LOOKING FORWARD TO A BIG

01:48:45 EARNINGS WEEK.

01:48:46 ALPHABET AND GOOGLE COMING UP TOMORROW ALONGSIDE MICROSOFT

01:48:50 TUESDAY, META ON WEDNESDAY AND AMAZON ON THURSDAY.

01:48:55 CENTRAL BANK DECISIONS IN BETWEEN, THE FED ON WEDNESDAY

01:48:56 AND THURSDAY THE ECB. THE BOJ IS IN THE BACKGROUND.

01:49:03 THAT'S ON FRIDAY SO WHAT WILL THEY DO WITH THEIR INFLATION

01:49:05 OUTLOOK? TOM:

01:49:11 USE THE MARKET IS A POINT OF INFORMATION HERE.

01:49:15 DOLLAR-YEN IS .43. A STRONGER YEN, WEAKER DOLLAR

01:49:20 WHICH IS AN AFFIRMATION THAT THEY ARE UNDER CONTROL.

01:49:27 IT'S MESSED UP THAT ONE SENTENCE GOTTEN WRONG COULD GO

01:49:28 EITHER WAY.

01:49:35 WITH THE FANCY PEOPLE ON THIS TOPIC REMOVED FROM ALL OF US,

01:49:36 ITS PINS AND NEEDLES. JONATHAN: I THINK THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

01:49:41 THE CENTRAL BANKS ARE FASCINATING.

01:49:47 EUROPE AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE WANTS NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT

01:49:49 WHATSOEVER. WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM, EQUITY

01:49:54 FUTURES ARE POSITIVE BY 0.1%. PLENTY OF DATA THIS WEEK, PMI

01:50:01 LATER THIS MORNING IN THE 9:00 HOUR EASTERN TIME AFTER SOME

01:50:05 DISAPPOINTING PMI IN AMERICA.

01:50:11 EWCI WILL BE OUT AS WELL. WE WILL BREAK DOWN SOME OF THAT.

01:50:20 TOM: I'M LOOKING AT THAT TTIP. -- AT THE DATA.

01:50:29 JOBS ARE EARLY WITH CLAIMS ON AUGUST 3 WITH APPLE.

01:50:35 AUGUST 4 EARLY JOBS DATA THIS TIME AROUND, CPI IS AUGUST 10.

01:50:40 JONATHAN: AND THEN INTO JACKSON HOLE? TOM:

01:50:46 LAST FRIDAY INTO THIS WEEKEND, THAT WAS WHAT WE WILL HEAR IN

01:50:48 JACKSON HOLE.

01:51:01 THEY HAVE AUTHENTIC COWBOYS OUT THERE. I'M DRESSED LIKE HOPALONG

01:51:05 CASSIDY. IT SHOULD BE FUN.

01:51:13 JONATHAN: WHAT DO YOU EAT THERE? TOM: CHIPPED BEEF ON TOAST.

01:51:18 JONATHAN: IT'S LIKE BREAD WITH THE WHITE,

01:51:19 GOOEY SAUCE.

01:51:25 IT'S LIKE A 1950'S THING LIKE VELVETY TO CHEESE. JONATHAN:

01:51:28 I'M AWARE.

01:51:36 INVESCO WILL JOIN US SHORTLY. EQUITY FUTURES ON THE S&P ARE

01:51:40 POSITIVE BY 0.1%.

01:51:59 >> I THINK THE FED AND THE ECB ARE GIVING SOME FACILITY BUT

01:52:00 NOT MUCH FURTHER TO GO.

01:52:09 THE S&P 500 IS REPORTING THIS WEEK.

01:52:16 JONATHAN: A GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST WHO

01:52:20 HAS BEEN CONSTRUCTIVE ON THIS EQUITY MARKET ALL YEAR.

01:52:23 HE'S LOOKING FOR MORE GAINS AHEAD ANYTHING EARNINGS WILL

01:52:26 PICK UP WITH A TON OF EARNINGS THIS WEEK FROM BIG TECH.

01:52:29 IT STARTS TOMORROW AFTER THE CLOSING BELL.

01:52:34 LOOKING AT THE EQUITY MARKET THIS MORNING, A LIFT ON THE S&P

01:52:38 500 BY 0.1%. YIELDS ARE DOWN SLIGHTLY LOWER.

01:52:49 DATA IN EUROPE IS NOT GREAT IN THE DATA IN EUROPE IS NOT

01:52:50 PRETTY. CENTRAL BANKS ARE STILL SET TO

01:52:53 HIKE IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS. THAT'S THE BACKDROP. TOM:

01:52:58 WHEN THE FACTS CHANGE, THEY WILL CHANGE AS WELL.

01:53:02 THEY WILL WAIT TO SEE THE DATA AND MAYBE WE WILL SEE AN

01:53:03 ABRUPTNESS.

01:53:11 ROB STONE IS LINKED IN TO BRAZIL/PANAMA.

01:53:15 YOU ARE WATCHING THIS SURREPTITIOUSLY? JONATHAN:

01:53:17 IT'S PRETTY SPECIAL.

01:53:24 IT'S AN AWESOME TEAM BUILDER. TOM: ARE THEY MAKING AN IMPACT

01:53:27 ACROSS AMERICA? JONATHAN: SOCCER HERE IS HUGE AND IS

01:53:32 GETTING BETTER -- BIGGER IN THE U.K. AS WELL.

01:53:38 TOM: 3-0 BRAZIL/PANAMA BUT THE NEXT

01:53:40 ROUND WILL GET MORE COMPETITIVE? JONATHAN: YES.

01:53:47 TOM: THERE IS YOUR WORLD CUP COVERAGE FOR TODAY.

01:53:50 I DON'T SEE THE VIDEO YET ON IT. JONATHAN:

01:53:53 I PUT IT OUT ON TWITTER. TOM: EXCUSE ME.

01:54:01 JOHN PUT IT OUT ON X. JONATHAN: IT DIDN'T QUITE WORK.

01:54:08 TOM: ANYTHING WE ASKED MAX BRILL IS

01:54:11 USELESS.

01:54:20 LET'S SAVE OURSELVES FROM X.

01:54:29 IT'S IN A NO MAN'S LAND BETWEEN HIGH YIELD AND FULL FAITH AND

01:54:30 CREDIT. WHAT DO YOU LEARN IN QUALITY

01:54:34 CREDIT RIGHT NOW? HOW DO YOU SEE THEM OUT ON

01:54:40 YIELD OR TOTAL RETURN SIX MONTHS YEAR?

01:54:45 >> GOOD MORNING, WE ARE LOOKING AT TOTAL RETURNS AND EVERYONE

01:54:51 IS COMPARING CASH VERSUS ACTUAL FIXED RATE BONDS AND THEY ARE

01:54:55 UP 3.5% YEAR TO DATE WHICH IS COUPON PLUS, MAYBE AHEAD OF

01:54:58 WHERE CASH AND T-BILLS ARE. GOING FORWARD, WE THINK THERE

01:55:01 IS A GOOD PATH. THE INFLOWS HAVE BEEN THERE

01:55:06 WE'VE SEEN ABOUT 17 WEEKS OF INFLOWS.

01:55:08 SPREADS ARE KIND OF NEUTRAL OVER THE RANGE BUT YIELDS ARE

01:55:13 EXTREMELY ATTRACTIVE IN THE LOW 5'S AND THAT DRAWS MONEY IN OUT

01:55:15 OF CASH LITTLE BY LITTLE. PEOPLE ARE STILL HANGING ONTO

01:55:21 T-BILLS BUT THEY CONTINUALLY ARE STEPPING OUT OF THE CURVE.

01:55:25 THINK WE ARE SETTING UP FOR A GOOD TOTAL RETURN. TOM:

01:55:28 DO YOU SEE CORPORATE ISSUANCE?

01:55:35 WILL YOU SEE A LOT OF CORPORATE ISSUANCE HERE OR WILL THE CEOS

01:55:37 PULL IT BACK?

01:55:41 >> FOR THE MOST PART, YOU ARE SEEING THE TYPICAL CORPORATION

01:55:44 SAYING THIS IS FAIRLY EXPENSIVE AND I DON'T WANT TO BORROW AT

01:55:46 5.5%. THEY ARE NOT LEVERING UP AND IS

01:55:52 BEEN LESS M&A OVER THE NEAR-TERM.

01:55:56 WE WILL SEE IF PEOPLE ADJUST TO THIS NEW RATE ENVIRONMENT AND

01:55:57 THERE HASN'T BEEN A LOT OF DEBT COMING DUE.

01:56:00 THEY HAVE TWO OR 3% BONDS. THEY HAVEN'T REALLY FELT THE

01:56:06 FULL SHOCK OF THE RATE CURVE GOING HIGHER YET.

01:56:11 WE WILL SEE FOR THE TYPICAL INDUSTRIALS WITHIN THE BANKS

01:56:12 FACE. BANKS HAVE BEEN BORROWING MORE

01:56:13 THIS LAST WEEK.

01:56:22 YOU WILL SEE THE BIG BANKS BORROWING BUT THE REGIONAL

01:56:24 BANKS WILL BE ON THE SIDELINE AND SAY IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE.

01:56:27 JONATHAN: I'M INTERESTED WHEN THEY HAVE

01:56:29 TO BORROW, NOT WHEN THEY WANT TO BORROW. WHEN DO THEY NEED TO?

01:56:39 HAS THE HIGH-YIELD BOND EVER REALLY MATURED?

01:56:45 WHERE IS THE WINDOW OF THE TECHNICALS, WHERE IS IT?

01:56:49 >> FOR THE IG MARKET, THERE IS NO MATURITY WALL.

01:56:55 THE HIGH-YIELD MARKET IS UP 3% AND COMING DUE THE REST OF THIS

01:56:59 YEAR WITH 9% DUE IN 2024. THEN IT GOES TO LIKE 15% SO

01:57:05 THEY WILL PROBABLY WORK TO ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE THEY WILL

01:57:10 REFINANCE THAT. THE WALL IS VERY CONTROLLED OR

01:57:16 LOW FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS AND THEN IT CUTS HIGHER FROM THERE

01:57:21 BUT THEN IT GOES BACK TO NO ONE HAS FELT THE FULL EFFECT OF

01:57:23 THIS HIGHER YIELD YET. THEY HAVE NOT HAD A LOT OF DEBT

01:57:24 ROLLOFF. IF AND WHEN THAT COMES A LARGER

01:57:29 PERCENTAGE OF THEIR DEBT WILL BE EIGHT OR 9%.

01:57:35 I THINK IS GOOD FOR FIXED RATE BORROWERS THAT THEY'VE BEEN

01:57:36 ABLE TO LOCK IN YIELDS FOR LONGER TERM. JONATHAN:

01:57:41 HAS IT EVER BEEN WIDE -- THIS WIDE BETWEEN A COUPON PAYMENT

01:57:46 FOR COMPANY AND WHAT WOULD CAUSE THEM TO ARO IN THE SECOND

01:57:52 -- TO BORROW IN THE SECONDARY MARKET RIGHT NOW?

01:58:01 >> NOT SINCE THE 1980'S OR THE LATE 70'S.

01:58:06 THE BOND ROSE OFTEN 4% AND YOU REPLACE IT BUT THAT'S NOT THE

01:58:13 CASE NOW.

01:58:14 APPLE IS BORROWING AT 1.5% FOR A LONG TIME SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY

01:58:18 COULD. I THINK THEY WILL KEEP THAT IS

01:58:20 THEIRS DISH AS THEIR CAPITAL STRUCTURE BUT THEY MAY CHOOSE

01:58:26 TO PAY OFF. WE WILL HAVE TO SEE. IT STILL CREATIVE EARNINGS.

01:58:33 TOM:

01:58:39 A DELICATE QUESTION --

01:58:48 IS CHALLENGES IN THE LEVERAGED LOAN MARKET, HOW BAD IS IT?

01:58:52 >> IT HASN'T BEEN BAD YET SIMPLY BECAUSE THE ECONOMY IS

01:58:56 GOING SO STRONG.

01:59:06 THE LOW RATE MARKET WILL GO UP IN SUMMER BORROWING AT 12% OR

01:59:10 MORE. IT CAN BE ATTRACTED TO THE LENDER BUT PUNITIVE TO THE

01:59:13 BORROWER. AS LONG AS THE ECONOMY STAYS

01:59:17 THE STRONG, THEY WILL BE FINE BUT IF YOU CAR LANDING, YOU

01:59:20 COULD BE IN MORE TROUBLE. JONATHAN:

01:59:26 THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE ON CREDIT THERE.

01:59:30 JUST GOT A GREAT EMAIL FROM AN AMERICAN.

01:59:37 ABOUT SOCCER IN AMERICA, THIS IS SOMEONE WHO WATCHED CHELSEA

01:59:38 RECENTLY. AMERICANS NEED TO STAY IN THEIR

01:59:43 SEATS AND PUT THEIR PHONES DOWN. IT'S IS NOT AMERICAN FOOTBALL

01:59:47 WHERE YOU HAVE HOURS OF NOTHING HAPPENING.

01:59:51 IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT WAY OF EXPERIENCING THE GAME.

01:59:57 THAT CAME IN MOMENTS AGO. TOM: HUGE DEAL.

02:00:04 I HEAR FROM LOTS OF PEOPLE. THERE IS AN OUTRAGE OVER THIS

02:00:15 NEW THING WHERE IT'S COOL .IT'S LIKE THAT GAME IS

02:00:18 SECONDARY. YOU CAN START WITH FOOTBALL.

02:00:30 IT'S A VERY SENSITIVE DEAL WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT

02:00:35 WE ARE MORE FOCUSED. I ENJOYED THE TIME THE TOPS LET

02:00:43 ME CAME IN FOR FREE.

02:00:50 I REALLY ENJOY THE FOCUS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.

02:01:00 JONATHAN: IT'S A DIFFERENT RHYTHM THAN AT

02:01:02 HALFTIME. TOM: IT'S A SENSITIVE ISSUE IN

02:01:07 AMERICAN SPORTS. JONATHAN: FROM NEW YORK, THIS IS

02:01:11 BLOOMBERG.

02:01:29 TOM: BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE, GOOD

02:01:32 MORNING AND ON FRIDAY WE LOOK TO JACKSON HOLE.

02:01:36 LISA ABRAMOWICZ IS OUT ON THE TUNDRA.

02:01:40 SHE IS LOOKING AT POLAR BEARS IN ICELAND.

02:01:44 AN IMPORTANT 9:00 HOUR COMING UP.

02:01:51 BITCOIN IS OVER $29,000 RIGHT NOW.

02:01:59 THE VIX IS UP 14, A FRACTIONAL GREEN ON THE SCREEN NOW.

02:02:04 WE WILL DIVE INTO THE ECONOMY. WE NEED TO GO TO MICHAEL MCKEE.

02:02:10 FRIDAY I WILL LOOK TO JACKSON HOLE.

02:02:14 WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE AND MY PEOPLE ARE HANDLING THIS, WE

02:02:16 WILL NOT BE UP AT 3 A.M. THIS YEAR.

02:02:19 WE WILL SHIP BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE LATER IN THE

02:02:23 MORNING TO GET IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN THE CONVERSATION.

02:02:27 THAT'S THE LINE YOU'RE GETTING FROM FOLKS.

02:02:28 THE OTHER REASON IS SO I CAN GET MY CHIPS TOASTY BEFORE THE

02:02:32 SHOW. FOR THOSE ON RADIO, IT'S A BEAUTIFUL IMAGE OF POTATOES AND

02:02:37 MY FATHER WOULD CALL THIS A BIG GLOB WHICH IS CHIPPED BEEF IN A

02:02:43 WHITE SAUCE. THE PIONEER GRILLED SPEAKS FOR

02:02:46 ITSELF. MIKE:

02:02:48 IT DOESN'T YOU SPEAK FOR YOURSELF WANTING TO EAT THAT

02:02:59 STUFF.

02:03:00 TOM: EVERYBODY EATS THEIR ALONG WITH

02:03:03 THE WONDERFUL PEOPLE IN WYOMING. IT'S SOMETHING TO LOOK DOWN THE

02:03:10 PIONEER GRILL AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE KANSAS CITY FED AND ALL

02:03:13 OF HER STEP IS SITTING THERE. WHAT IS THE KANSAS CITY FED

02:03:19 DOING NOW TO MAKE FOR A SUCCESSFUL JACKSON HOLE?

02:03:22 >> LOOKING FOR A REPLACEMENT. MIKE:

02:03:28 THE FORMER PRESIDENT RETIRED QUITE SOME TIME AGO AND THEY

02:03:30 STILL DON'T HAVE A PRESIDENT A MONTH OUT FROM THE EVENT.

02:03:35 I TALKED WITH SOMEBODY THERE FRIDAY.

02:03:41 THEY ALWAYS SAID THIS EVENT IS BIGGER THAN ONE PERSON. TOM:

02:03:48 THIS IS THE HEARTLAND OF AMERICA, KANSAS CITY AND DALLAS

02:03:52 HAVE A DIFFERENT OUTLOOK THAN THE SALTWATER ECONOMIES WEATHER

02:03:56 AT SAN FRANCISCO OR THE TRADITIONAL EAST COAST. ONE IS

02:04:01 IN EARLY FEE FOR JACKSON HOLE WHERE WE DON'T KNOW THE

02:04:04 SCHEDULE AND WE DON'T KNOW THE AGENDA AT WE DON'T KNOW THE

02:04:05 ECONOMIC PAPERS YET. WHAT WILL IT LOOK LIKE? MIKE:

02:04:11 IT'S PUTTING TOGETHER A FRAGMENTED ECONOMY WILL BE THE

02:04:15 THEME AS WE TRY TO RECOVER FROM THE PANDEMIC.

02:04:18 AND THE VARIOUS THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN GOING ON IN VARIOUS

02:04:22 SECTORS THAT DON'T ADD UP PREVIOUS MODELS. TOM:

02:04:31 FOR ME, JACKSON HOLE IS TWO CONSECUTIVE DAYS OF CHIPPED

02:04:36 BEEF AND TOAST. NATIONWIDE JOINS US NOW WITH A CLEAR VIEW

02:04:38 ON THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. THERE IS THE DISAGGREGATION OF

02:04:43 THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. DO YOU PUT IT INTO ONE ECONOMY

02:04:48 OR DO YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT AMERICA AND SEPARATE IT?

02:04:50 >> GOOD MORNING.

02:04:57 IT DEVOLVES. YOU LOOK AT THE TOP DOWN BUT

02:05:01 THEN YOU HAVE TO DISAGGREGATE AND I LOOK AT IT ACROSS THE

02:05:03 SPECTRUMS OF THE ECONOMY.

02:05:10 IT'S BEEN A VERY INTERESTING POST COVID -- IT WAS THE

02:05:15 RECOVERY AND THEN THE EXPANSION WHICH IS UNIQUE AND WE SEE

02:05:19 THESE ROLLING RECESSIONS. DO THEY CULMINATE IN A BROAD

02:05:23 BASE ANY REAL RECESSION THAT THE NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC

02:05:26 RESEARCH WILL CLAIM IS A RECESSION? TOM:

02:05:29 ARE WE A FULLY EMPLOYED AMERICA? >> YES, WE ARE OVER EMPLOYED.

02:05:42 IT'S GREAT IF YOU ARE IN EMPLOYEE BUT IT'S PROBLEMATIC

02:05:44 FOR THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO BALANCE THAT AGAINST INFLATION

02:05:47 PRESSURES. SOME CORPORATIONS ARE STILL

02:05:50 FINDING QUALIFIED WORKERS AND FEELING THE WAGE PRESSURE

02:05:53 DURING THIS PERIOD.

02:05:59 MIKE: THE ROLLING RECESSIONS IS WHAT

02:06:04 HAPPENED IN 2015-16 AND NOW WE SEEM TO BE SEEING IT AGAIN.

02:06:13 WE SAW A SLOWDOWN IN NEW HOME CONSTRUCTION AND A NEW LOW IN

02:06:16 AUTO SALES AND THEY HAD COME BACK.

02:06:21 IS THIS WHAT WE WILL SEE THE NEXT YEAR OR SO OR AN OVERALL

02:06:24 FORECAST WITH A DECLINE IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY?

02:06:28 >> THAT'S THE KEY QUESTION. IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET THE

02:06:33 TIMING. WE ARE STILL IN THE CAMP THAT

02:06:38 WE ARE CAUTIOUS AND THINK CONDITIONS ARE THERE FOR A

02:06:39 FULL-BLOWN RECESSION. WE HAVE ALWAYS ARGUED IT WOULD

02:06:43 BE ON THE MODERATE SIDE.

02:06:50 YOU ARE RIGHT, HOUSING IS THE FIRST SECTOR TO HEAR THE PINCH

02:06:51 OF INTEREST -- HIGHER INTEREST RATES.

02:06:53 NOW WE ARE COMING BACK AT LEAST FOR CONSTRUCTION AND NEW HOME

02:06:59 SALES. PEOPLE CAN'T FIND ENOUGH SUPPLY

02:07:03 IN THIS MARK -- IN THIS MARKET.

02:07:12 THE SUBSIDIZED MORTGAGE RATE IS 5% WHICH IS BETTER THAN SEVEN

02:07:13 BUT THAT'S THE HOPE ON THE HOUSING MARKET.

02:07:20 THERE'S BEEN A RESTRAINT OF SUPPLY AND THERE IS STILL

02:07:29 PENT-UP DEMAND.

02:07:31 AUTOMOBILES HAVE PRICING POWER AND THEY ARE CONTINUING THAT

02:07:32 SHORTAGE OF SUPPLY.

02:07:39 MANUFACTURING GLOBALLY, WE ARE SEEING THAT AS A RECESSION AND

02:07:40 IT SEEMS TO BE GETTING WORSE.

02:07:48 CHINA HAS BEEN REOPENING AND WE'VE HAD 11 MONTHS STRAIGHT OF

02:07:52 IMPROVEMENTS. TIME WILL TELL AND THE LABOR

02:07:56 MARKET IS RESILIENT ENOUGH TO OFFSET THOSE OTHER FACTORS.

02:08:04 WE THINK EVEN WHEN THE FED IS DONE HIKING, WE THINK

02:08:06 RESTRICTIVE RATES EVENTUALLY WILL PINCH THIS ECONOMY.

02:08:09 WE WILL SEE IS SLOW DOWN. MIKE:

02:08:15 YES BUT DO WE ACTUALLY HAVE A RECESSION?

02:08:18 WE GOT WAGES RISING FASTER THAN INFLATION RIGHT NOW.

02:08:26 >> THAT'S RIGHT, RIGHT NOW, THERE IS SOME REAL INCOME GAINS.

02:08:31 THE KEY HERE IS WHAT HAPPENS WITH CORPORATE PROFITS AND

02:08:36 BALANCE SHEETS. IF INFLATION CONTINUES TO TREND

02:08:40 LOWER WHICH IS WHAT WE EXPECT GRADUALLY, CORPORATIONS WILL

02:08:44 BENEFIT AND WE ARE SEEING UP DATING WAGE PRESSURE GOING ON.

02:08:51 MORE WILL GO ALONG WITH UBS AND THE OTHERS.

02:08:59 ULTIMATELY, THAT'S WHERE THE CONSUMER FEELS THE NEGATIVE.

02:09:07 TOM: ANOTHER ANALYST SAID HE'S CONSTRUCTED ON AN ECONOMY THAT

02:09:11 LOSES STEAM ON INVENTORY DYNAMICS. LECTURE US ON MARGINAL

02:09:16 INVENTORIES.

02:09:26 DO YOU THINK WERE MARGINAL INVENTORIES WON'T ASSIST GPT --

02:09:28 GP GOING FORWARD?

02:09:31 >> THAT'S A GREAT POINT. INVENTORIES SEEM TO BE WORKING

02:09:34 IN THE BACKGROUND. WHEN THEY SWING, IT CAN BE A

02:09:40 POWERFUL FORCE IN THE BUSINESS CYCLE DYNAMIC.

02:09:44 IT CAN BE VERY LARGE THREAT OR MAYBE ADD TO GDP.

02:09:48 COMPANIES THAT HAVE GOTTEN THERE INVENTORIES AND

02:09:55 CELEBRATIONS IN THEIR SHAPE, IT DOES NOT MEAN WE WILL SEE A LOT

02:09:56 OF THIS GOING FORWARD. THAT'S A HEADWIND FOR GDP

02:10:00 GROWTH. JUST LIKE STUDENT LOANS DEBT

02:10:04 REVIEWS COMING UP, THAT'S A HEADWIND.

02:10:13 THE DATA HAS BEEN STRONGER AS PICKING UP SOME SUPPORT IN THE

02:10:16 SOFT LANDING CAMP AT THE ECONOMY IS STILL SOFT.

02:10:19 IT'S NOT HARD TO GET HIS INTO RECESSION.

02:10:22 THAT'S WHERE WE REMAIN CAUTIOUS. TOM:

02:10:28 WILL THE STOCK MARKET ADAPT TO THIS OR IS IT REMOVED FROM AN

02:10:29 ECONOMIC SLOW DOWN?

02:10:36 >> HISTORICALLY, THE EQUITY MARKET IS NOT IMMUNE TO

02:10:41 RECESSION OR A DOWNTURN. IF YOU GET THAT ALREADY COME IN

02:10:49 THAT DIRECTION AND NOW, I WOULD ARGUE THAT VALUATIONS ARE QUITE

02:10:57 HIGH.

02:10:58 IF WE HAVE A RECESSION, PROFITS GO DOWN.

02:11:02 WE WOULD BE CAUTIOUS WE DON'T THINK IT IS IMMUNE TO A

02:11:03 RECESSION.

02:11:09 MIKE: THE GENERAL FEELING WEDNESDAY

02:11:12 IS THE FED COULD SORT OF STIPULATE WHAT'S GOING TO DO.

02:11:16 WHAT THEY TELL US ABOUT THE FUTURE IS WHAT IS GOOD OR BAD

02:11:18 FOR THE MARKETS OF WHAT WILL THEY TELL US ABOUT THE CHURCH?

02:11:21 DO THEY KEEP GOING AFTER ONE MORE?

02:11:28 >> IT IS WHAT THEY PROVIDE AS FAR AS FORWARD GUIDANCE.

02:11:35 25 BASIS POINTS SEEM TO BE A SHORT BET.

02:11:38 THERE IS A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY. LAST NIGHT JUST LAST TIME, THEY

02:11:46 ADDED TWO MORE RATE HIKES BUT I THINK DATA COMES IN BETTER THAN

02:11:51 EXPECTED AND I THINK CHAIRMAN POWELL SHOULD BACK UP AT A

02:11:57 LITTLE BIT.

02:11:58 STILL YOU NEED TO BE CAUTIOUS BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT

02:11:59 INFLATION WHICH WOMEN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO REVERSE YEARS.

02:12:05 INFLATION HAS BEEN A PICKUP BUT THE BASE EFFECT WILL BE LESS

02:12:06 FAVORABLE GOING FORWARD.

02:12:08 TOM: WHAT IS YOUR PREDICTION FOR GDP

02:12:12 FOR THE SECOND QUARTER? FOR ENDING JUNE 30, WHAT IS THE

02:12:17 STATISTIC?

02:12:22 >> WE HAVE SLIGHTLY ABOVE 2%, 2.2%.

02:12:29 ITS RESILIENCE IN THE CONSUMER AND NONRESIDENTIAL INVESTMENT.

02:12:35 IT WILL BE ADDED TO THE END PRICE.

02:12:42 AND WE WILL NOT HAVE A SLUMP FOR RESIDENTIAL INVESTORS

02:12:44 BECAUSE HOUSING HAS A STABILIZED.

02:12:52 THE MEMBER OF THE FED WANTS IT BELOW 1.8% POTENTIALLY.

02:12:56 THERE MUST BE SEVERAL QUARTERS OF GROWTH WILL BELOW 2%. TOM:

02:13:01 THANK YOU SO MUCH.

02:13:12 WEIRD IS INTERNATIONAL COME INTO THIS?

02:13:17 IS THAT PART OF THIS DISCUSSION FORWARD? MIKE:

02:13:19 IT'S A MINOR PART OF THIS POINT. TRADERS HAVE NOT BEEN A HUGE

02:13:27 FACTOR IN THE OVERALL GROWTH PICTURE FOR THE UNITED STATES

02:13:33 IN RECENT MONTHS.

02:13:35 YOU SEEN PEOPLE SAY IT WILL HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON

02:13:38 THE U.S. TOM: IT'S AN IMPORTANT THEME.

02:13:45 WE ARE GETTING READY FOR A FED MEETING WEDNESDAY AND FUTURES

02:13:48 ARE UP SIX IN THE S&P 500 IS UP 012%.

02:13:51 GOOD MORNING TO ALL OF YOU ON RADIO AND TELEVISION.

02:13:54 LISA IS ON ASSIGNMENT. I LOOKED ON THE MAP.

02:14:05 MIKE: SHE WILL PROBABLY HAVE GREAT

02:14:07 PICTURES OF THE NORTHERN LIGHTS. TOM: THEY GO AROUND THE WORLD.

02:14:11 IT'S A LATITUDE THING. WE DON'T SEE THEM.

02:14:14 MIKE: NOT SO MUCH HERE BECAUSE IT'S

02:14:17 TOO LIGHT. TOM: MAYBE YOU NEED TO GO UP TO

02:14:20 YONKERS.

02:14:28 THE ASTRONOMY REPORT WITH MICHAEL MCKEE AND JONATHAN GET

02:14:32 -- GETTING READY FOR THE 9:00 HOUR.

02:14:36 THE MYSTIC FINAL SALES SEEMS TO BE FRONT AND CENTER VERSUS THE

02:14:37 INTERNATIONAL. MIKE: YOU TAKE AT THE EXPORTS AND WE

02:14:45 TAKE OUT BASICALLY GOVERNMENT SALES.

02:14:48 WE KNOW THE GOVERNMENT SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY ON WEAPONRY.

02:14:53 IT IS WHAT CONSUMERS ARE DOING THAT'S THE KEY ISSUE.

02:15:02 EVERYBODY THANKS THEY ARE SPENDING DOWN THEIR PANDEMIC

02:15:04 BENEFITS IN THE INFLATION RATE HAS EATEN AWAY AT THEIR

02:15:07 SALARIES EVEN THOUGH WE ARE RUNNING AHEAD OF THAT AND THEY

02:15:08 WILL PULL IN THEIR HORNS. COMING UP, WE GOT BACK TO

02:15:13 SCHOOL AND THEN THE HOLIDAYS. IF YOU'RE GOING TO SEE ANY KIND

02:15:19 OF SERIOUS SLOW DOWN, IT WILL HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT OF

02:15:23 CONSUMERS PULLBACK BUT A LOT OF THAT IS CONFIDENCE.

02:15:26 CONFIDENCE HAS BEEN GOING UP. TOM:

02:15:31 WE MENTIONED THIS EARLIER, THE

02:15:37 ISRAELI PARLIAMENT APPROVED THEIR CONTROVERSIAL JUDICIAL

02:15:38 OVERSIGHT LAW.

02:15:45 PLEASE STAY WITH US, WORLDWIDE, THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE.

02:16:04 >> A NUMBER OF AIRLINES WERE ONLY OPERATING AT 93% CAPACITY.

02:16:09 WE BEEN GROWING STRONGLY AND OUR GROWTH IS RESTORING TRAFFIC

02:16:11 THAT WAS TAKEN OUT DURING THE PANDEMIC.

02:16:14 IT'S GROWING ACROSS EUROPE WITH MORE CONSOLIDATION AT THE

02:16:19 MOMENT.

02:16:21 THAT'S LIKELY TO IMPROVE OVER THE NEXT TWO OR THREE YEARS.

02:16:26 TOM: THEIR CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER.

02:16:38 MIKE: I HAVE NOT FLOWN RYANAIR YET.

02:16:40 TOM: I WAS GOING TO GO TO MOROCCO ON

02:16:41 IT. MIKE:

02:16:47 YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO STOP SOMEPLACE. TOM:

02:16:51 GOOD MORNING TO RYANAIR IN THE SPIRIT THEY HAVE.

02:16:54 MICHAEL MCKEE IS WITH US NOW. IT'S A MONDAY IN THE SUMMER AND

02:17:03 WE ARE THRILLED THAT EDWARD HARRISON IS WITH US AND HE

02:17:04 LOOK
