00:13 >> OUR POLICY RATE IS LIKELY AT ITS PEAK FOR THIS TIGHTENING

00:16 CYCLE. IT WILL LIKELY BE DIALING BACK

00:18 AT SOME POINT THIS YEAR.

00:23 >> I THINK THE MARKET IS TAKING IT AS A SIGNAL THEY WILL

00:25 TOLERATE SLIGHTLY HIGHER INFLATION FOR LONGER.

00:28 >> THEY HAVE TO TOLERATE A LITTLE HIGHER INFLATION IN THE

00:33 NEAR TERM.

00:35 >> I THINK THIS IS A FED THAT REALLY WANTS THE SOFT LANDING

00:36 TO CONTINUE.

00:41 >> HE SAID OVER AND OVER AGAIN IT DEPENDS ON THE DATA.

00:45 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE WITH JONATHAN

00:47 FARROW, ALISA BRAHMA ONCE AND AND REORDER IN. JONATHAN:

00:50 GOOD MORNING. FOR OUR AUDIENCE WORLDWIDE THIS

00:53 IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE. YOUR EQUITY MARKET S&P 500

00:57 RECORD HIGHS AT THE CLOSE. UP ONE THIRD OF 1%.

01:04 THE BIGGEST TAKE AWAY OF THE LAST 24 HOURS FOLLOWING

01:08 CHAIRMAN TELLS NEWS CONFERENCE, STRONGER INFLATION WON'T STOP

01:10 RATE CUTS. LISA: THIS IS A FEDERAL RESERVE THAT

01:17 WANTS TO CUT RATES IN THE HOTTER THAN EXPECTED INFLATION

01:20 DATA HAS NOT STIRRED THEM FROM THAT PATH AND THAT'S THE

01:22 MESSAGE THE MARKET IS HEARING LOUD AND CLEAR.

01:28 >> EQUITY MARKETS ALL-TIME HIGHS OF THE CLOSE ON THE S&P

01:29 500.

01:35 GOLD THROUGH 2200 FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER.

01:37 WHAT YOU THINK GOLD IS PICKING UP ON FOLLOWING YESTERDAY? LISA:

01:43 EITHER AN INFLATION HEDGE OR IT'S BEEN A STEADY MARCH HIGHER

01:47 AND THIS RAISES THE QUESTION

01:53 THE END OF TIGHTENING MONETARY POLICY, MEANS THAT REAL ASSETS

01:57 HAVE MORE VALUE AGAIN GIVEN INTEREST-BEARING ASSETS WON'T

01:58 BE AS INTEREST-BEARING GOING FORWARD.

02:04 JONATHAN: LISA WE HAD SOME QUESTIONS FOR

02:07 THE FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN AS -- HAS HE GAINED OR LOST

02:10 CONFIDENCE FOLLOWING THE PRINCE OF THE LAST FEW WEEKS.

02:12 THE ANSWER WAS BASICALLY NEITHER.

02:14 HE REFERRED TO THEM AS PUMPS. BASICALLY LOOKING THROUGH THE

02:20 RECENT INFLATION DATA AS PUMPS IN THE ROAD AND SAID ALMOST

02:21 EXPLICITLY THE STORY HAS NOT CHANGED.

02:25 >> ULTIMATELY IT'S A FEDERAL RESERVE THAT HAS SOME CHANGES.

02:28 HE SAID A LOT OF WORDS BUT DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A DIFFERENT

02:31 MESSAGE AND DID NOT HAVE A STORY TO TELL OTHER THAN WE ARE

02:35 MAKING PROGRESS WE WILL BE PATIENT AND IF IT TAKES TIME TO

02:37 GET DOWN TO 2% WE ARE OK WITH THAT.

02:42 THIS IS REALLY THE ULTIMATE SORT OF TURBOCHARGER TO STOCKS.

02:47 THIS IS A FEDERAL RESERVE THAT WILL PRIORITIZE THE SOFT

02:49 LANDING OVER INFLATION DATA THAT IS BUMPY CAUSING SOME ODD

02:51 TO IN OTHER CORNERS. JONATHAN:

02:55 THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF ACCEPTING SLIGHTLY HIGHER

03:03 INFLATION.

03:03 IF YOU GO THROUGH THE FORECAST, SLIGHTLY LESS FAST PICK UPGRADE

03:07 TO INFLATION. THEY CAN MAKE THE ARGUMENT ON

03:11 THIS BUT IF YOU REPEAT THAT IN JUNE BILL OF GOT MUCH BIGGER

03:13 QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR COMMITMENT TO GETTING BACK DOWN

03:14 TO 2%. I THINK THEY CAN HAVE A ONE-OFF

03:17 EXCUSE THIS TIME AROUND. I DON'T THINK YOU CAN PREPARE

03:21 THAT IN QUITE THE SAME WAY IN A FEW MONTHS TIME.

03:24 >> WHICH IS A REASON THERE ARE NO RATE CUT PEOPLE OUT THERE

03:28 SAYING THEY WANT TO CUT RATES BUT THEY WILL NOT BE GIVEN THE

03:30 PRIVILEGE TO DO SO. THIS IS A QUESTION OF WHEN TO

03:33 THE DATA POINTS, MORE THAN THE NOISE.

03:36 RIGHT NOW IT SEEMS THAT THE FED IS DISMISSING THEM AS NOISE.

03:38 THE MARKET MAYBE NOT. THEY ARE TAKING THE MESSAGE OF

03:42 THE FED IS NOT MEANT TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.

03:44 THIS IS THE REASON WHY DATA DEPENDENCY IS DIFFICULT.

03:48 HOW MANY DATA POINTS DO YOU NEED TO BE DEPENDENT ON THOSE

03:53 STATUS.

03:54 JONATHAN: SURPRISE 25 BASIS POINT CUT

03:56 MUCH WEAKER SWISS FRANC OVERNIGHT.

04:00 DOLLARS SWISS PUSHING 19 ON THE SCREEN. BY ABOUT 0.8%.

04:06 I KNOW I REFER TO THEM, THE LIKES THE SMB, WHAT OTHER

04:09 CENTRAL BANKS ARE DOING.

04:12 >> THEY ARE TRYING TO GET AHEAD OF ANY MOVE FROM THE FEDERAL

04:15 RESERVE AND ECB BECAUSE THEY WANT A WEAKER CURRENCY.

04:18 THEY WANT A WEAKER SWISS FRANC AND TO ME THIS RAISES THE

04:21 QUESTION WILL THE SECOND HALF OF 2024 BE THE RACE TO CUT

04:25 ESSENTIALLY HOW DO YOU CUT FIRST AND GET AHEAD OF THE

04:28 OTHER SO YOU CAN CARRY THE BENEFITS OF BEING A MARKET

04:32 LEADER AND FRANKLY EDIFY AN ECONOMY THAT OTHERWISE COULD BE

04:35 SET BY A FEARS OF A HARD LANDING. JONATHAN:

04:41 EQUITY FUTURES POSITIVE BY 0.3%. THE EQUITY MARKET DOING BETTER

04:43 THAN OK. YIELDS DOWN AGAIN BY ANOTHER

04:46 BASIS POINT.

04:52 AND THE EURO AGAINST THE DOLLAR 1.0 917.

04:56 THE FED FUEL STOCKS ALL-TIME HIGHS. THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION

05:00 RELAXES EVENING RULES MAKING SOME ROOM. WE HAVE J.P.

05:05 MORGAN ON THE FED'S PATH FORWARD AND IF THE CALL FOR

05:08 THREE CUTS WAS SHIFTING TO TWO OR EVEN FEWER.

05:11 THE FED FUELING GLOBAL STOCKS TO ALL-TIME HIGHS.

05:14 JAY POWELL & CO. STICKING TO THREE CUTS FOR THE

05:19 YEAR DESPITE A STRING OF HOTTER THAN EXPECTED INFLATION PRINCE.

05:23 SOME ALL CAPS POSTING WITH GOLD RUNNING ABOUT 2200 FOR THE

05:24 FIRST TIME EVER. CHRIS, LET'S GET TO IT.

05:32 GOLD, WHAT IS THAT BREAK OFF IN GOLD ALL ABOUT GOING THROUGH

05:34 2200 FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER?

05:39 >> WHEN YOU LOOK BACK AT THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS THE LAST

05:43 SEVERAL WEEKS LET'S FIRST GO BACK TO JANUARY FEBRUARY WHERE

05:47 YOU HAD THE DECISIVE MOVE IN GOLD THROUGH 2100 AND WE FOUND

05:51 REALLY NOTABLE THESE LAST TWO WEEKS AS BOND YIELDS PUSHBACK

05:55 HIGHER AND THEY GO FROM FOUR TO ABOUT 435. GOLD DID NOT FLINCH.

06:03 IT WAS A VERY ORDERLY PAUSE, THE TITLE IS GOLD NEW.

06:07 GOLD KNEW WE WOULD BE GETTING A DOVISH FED YESTERDAY.

06:09 I THINK CERTAINLY THE RESPONSE SPEAKS TO THAT HERE.

06:15 I THINK THE BACKDROP REMAINS POLISH IN METALS, BULLISH AND

06:19 MATERIALS AND WE SEE THAT WITH THE EXPANSION OF NEW HIGHS IN

06:21 THINGS LIKE COPPER, THE MATERIAL STOCKS. ETC..

06:26 >> WATCH WHAT THEY DO AND NOT WHAT THEY SAY.

06:28 WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT THEY ARE DOING.

06:33 IS THAT A FED SIGNALING THEY WILL TOLERATE HIGH INFLATION.

06:38 >> I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TONE OF REALLY GLOBAL BOND

06:42 MARKETS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS, I THINK THE BOND MARKET

06:46 IS SET ON THE IDEA ALMOST REGARDLESS OF WHERE SOME OF THE

06:49 NEW TERM INFLATION DATA COMES OUT. THESE ARE CENTRAL BANK THAT

06:51 WILL CUT. WE SEE THE MOVING SWISS

06:53 OVERNIGHT. THE SWISS BOND MARKET HAS BEEN

06:56 TELEGRAPHING THIS FOR WEEKS. I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THINGS

07:04 LIKE YOU TAKE 10 YEAR DEALS, GERMAN TENDS ARE STILL.

07:10 SO THE GLOBAL PICTURE FOR BONDS I THINK SUPPORTS THE IDEA THAT

07:14 ALMOST IRRESPECTIVE OF WHERE THE FUTURE INFLATION DATA COMES

07:16 IN. YOU WILL GET THE CENTRAL BANKS

07:18 CUTTING THE SHARE. LISA: THE IDEA OF WHY THERE'S SO MUCH

07:22 DEMAND. IS THIS A TRADE ON THE IDEA

07:29 THAT MAYBE INFLATION WILL RUN HOTTER AND THIS IS A GOOD HEDGE

07:30 AGAINST THAT. OR IS THIS A TRADE THAT THE FED

07:36 AND THE REST OF THE CENTRAL BANKING COMPLEX CUTTING RATES

07:38 WILL SUPPORT GROWTH AS SOME OF THE DEMAND FOR THE ASSETS?

07:42 >> I THINK IT'S MORE OF LATTER. USE THIS TERM FISCAL DOMINANCE

07:46 TO DESCRIBE WHY WE THINK GOLD IS IN THIS MARKET IMPLIES THE

07:51 CENTRAL BANK HAVE TO EASE GIVEN THE POSITION THESE SOVEREIGNS

07:53 ARE IN ACROSS THE WORLD.

07:59 ANYTIME YOU SEE GOLD BREAKOUT YOUR MIND DOES BEGIN TO WONDER.

08:02 IS THERE SOMETHING SINISTER OR OMINOUS ON THE HORIZON.

08:07 I THINK GOLD WAS TRYING TO COMMUNICATE THERE IS SOMETHING

08:08 NASTY OUT THERE. WE WOULD ALSO SEE IT IN CREDIT

08:12 CONDITIONS DETERIORATING WHICH WE HAVE NOT SEEN YET.

08:16 YESTERDAY WAS ONE OF THE BEST NEW HIGH RATINGS IN MONTHS AND

08:19 MONTHS AND MONTHS. I THINK GOLD IS MORE ABOUT THE

08:24 POSITION CENTRAL BANKS THEREIN RELATIVE TO WHERE THEIR

08:28 PHYSICAL COUNTERPARTS ARE AS OPPOSED TO SOME OF THE OMINOUS

08:31 MESSAGE ABOUT ECONOMIC GROWTH DOWN THE LINE.

08:36 >> GIVEN THAT IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE WHY THERE'S SO

08:38 MUCH MONEY JUST FLOODING INTO THE TRADES THAT HAVE DONE THE

08:40 BEST SO FAR THIS YEAR. AT WHAT POINT DO WE HAVE TO

08:43 WORRY ABOUT THE FACT WE HAVE AN ECONOMY BEING TURBOCHARGED BY

08:46 FISCAL MONEY AND A FEDERAL RESERVE AND OTHER CENTRAL BANKS

08:50 POISED TO EASE MONETARY CONDITIONS FROM THE TIGHTEST

08:52 LEVELS IN DECADES AT A TIME WHEN WE ARE NOT SEEING THOSE

08:55 REAL SIGNS OF WEAKNESS THAT COULD CURTAIL ANY UPSIDE

08:57 SURPRISE.

09:03 >> WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT OR MAKE LIGHT OF EVERYONE HAS THIS

09:04 FANCY LIQUIDITY MODEL. THE ONLY ONE THEY NEED IS THE

09:08 PRICE OF GOLD OR BITCOIN. THAT TELLS YOU EVERYTHING YOU

09:11 NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE LIQUIDITY MARKET THAT WE

09:14 CONTINUE TO DEAL IN HERE. WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT IRONIC

09:22 WHICH DESPITE THIS RIPPING MOVE HIGHER IN GOLD, THE PAPER

09:27 MARKET , THE FLOWS HAVE BASICALLY NOT ADJUSTED INTO THE

09:29 GLD ARE VERY MILD. CERTAINLY COMPARED TO WHERE WE

09:33 SEEM GOLD AT THE PASS. I DON'T THINK SENTIMENT IS THAT

09:36 HUGE THREAT YET. YOUR QUESTION LOOMS TO A LARGER

09:40 -- LONGER-TERM IDEA OF AT SOME POINT THIS GROWTH ULTIMATELY

09:44 BEGIN TO SLOW. IF THAT IS THE CASE WE WILL SEE

09:50 IT IN A CHANGE IN EQUITY MARKET LEADERSHIP.

09:53 I WOULD EXPECT THINGS LIKE INDUSTRIALS TO DETERIORATE,

09:58 THERE'S NOT IT'S ON OF EVIDENCE OF THAT YET.

10:03 SO FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM WE SEEM TO BE IN THE SWEET SPOT

10:06 WHERE YOU HAVE BOND YIELDS THAT LIKELY DON'T RUN AWAY FROM US,

10:10 AND I THINK GOLD, COPPER AND DISCRETIONARY END INDUSTRIALS

10:13 ALL REFLECT THAT. JONATHAN: USUAL SUSPECTS THE TOP OF THE

10:17 PILE. ENERGY ACTUALLY LAGGED.

10:23 ARE YOU SEEING SIGNALS? CHRIS: THERE'S A COUPLE OF IMPORTANT

10:26 THINGS GOING ON.

10:32 YOU MENTIONED ENERGY AND MATERIALS, I WOULD NOT CALL

10:33 THEM LEADERSHIP BUT THEY ARE NOT GOING DOWN.

10:38 WHEN YOUR LAGGARDS ARE GOING UP IN PRICE IT DESCRIBES A PRETTY

10:40 FULL -- THERE'S A LOT OF PARTICIPATION.

10:44 WE ARE STILL SITTING HERE 3.5 MONTHS INTO THE YEAR AND 80

10:49 PLUS PERCENT OF THE S&P, SO IT'S STILL PRETTY BROADLY MOST

10:52 ANY METRIC NOW. SOMETHING WE LIKE TO DO IN OUR

10:57 WORK IS LOOK AT WHAT THE CONSENSUS PERCEIVES TO BE THE

11:00 WEAKEST GROUP AND THEN SIMPLY ASK IS IT BEHAVING AS IF IT'S

11:01 THE WEAKEST GROUP.

11:07 FROM OUR CONVERSATIONS, THE CONSENSUS BELIEVES COMMERCIAL

11:09 REAL ESTATE AND REGIONAL BANKS WILL BE THE SOURCE OF ANY NEW

11:11 STRESS OR TROUBLE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CHARTS

11:15 THEY ARE JUST NOT THAT BAD. BANK STOCKS ARE PRETTY WELL BID.

11:21 THE REITS THANKFULLY -- FRANKLY TRADE PRETTY WELL.

11:24 ALONG THE IDEA THAT WE WILL NOT GET BOND YIELDS RUNNING AWAY

11:30 FROM HERE. OUR THINKING, OUR APPROACH

11:34 WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE WITH 10 YEAR YIELDS ABOVE 450. LISA:

11:38 ARE YOU A SCREAMING BOWL, CHRIS? CHRIS:

11:41 WE HAVE BEEN BULLISH AND I REMAIN BULLISH.

11:44 THE CHANGES TO THAT IF THERE'S A PROBLEM BREWING OUT THERE IF

11:49 THERE IS SOMETHING SINISTER IT IS TOO EARLY TO KNOW.

11:55 WE WOULD SEE IT IN REALLY DEGRADATION OR DETERIORATION TO

11:56 THE LEADERSHIP FABRIC OF THE MARKET.

12:00 THAT'S LARGELY BEEN INTACT FOR THE LAST YEAR.

12:03 I FOCUS ON THINGS LIKE IS DISCRETIONARY STILL

12:04 OUTPERFORMING STAPLES. OUR INDUSTRIAL SETTING THE

12:06 LEADERSHIP TONE OF THIS MARKET. SO LONG AS THOSE BOXES ARE

12:11 CHECKED WE ARE IN THE STATUS QUO ENVIRONMENT.

12:14 YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BE ON GUARD FOR THINGS THAT COULD CHANGE

12:15 THE VIEWER EXCEPT THAT. MAYBE IT'S OIL TO 90.

12:20 BUT NEITHER OUR BASE CASE.

12:27 >> FOR SO MANY THAT WAS JUST A GREEN LIGHT TO BUY EQUITIES.

12:29 GOLD RALLYING. EVERYTHING RALLYING AGAINST THE

12:31 U.S. DOLLAR IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE AS

12:34 WELL. A SNAPSHOT OF SOME OF THE FEEDBACK WE'VE GOT ON THE SPEED

12:39 -- SALE SIDE. RECENT INFLATION DATA JUST A

12:41 BUMP. FED STILL ON TRACK FOR A JUNE

12:44 RATE CUT. RATE CUTS ARE COMING EVEN IF

12:50 INFLATION WILL GROWTH RUN SMOOTHER THAN EXPECTED.

12:55 LOOKING AT HOW THE RECENT DATA HASN'T CHANGED IT AT ALL.

12:58 CHAIRMAN POWELL SAID A FEW TIMES IN A NEWS CONFERENCE THE

12:59 STORY HASN'T CHANGED. LISA: AT WHAT POINT DO INFLATION

13:05 CONCERNS BECOME A THREAT AGAIN OR DOES THE MARKET BY INTO THE

13:09 IDEA THAT GROWTH IS NOT GOING TO CAUSE INFLATION TO

13:15 MATERIALLY INCREASE, THAT IT IS COMPATIBLE TO SEE INFLATION,

13:18 DOWN EVEN WITH STRONG GROWTH THAT COULD BE A SELLER RATE --

13:21 RE-ACCELERATE. JONATHAN: THE CONVERSATION WE NEED TO

13:28 HAVE LATER THIS MORNING AND THROUGHOUT TODAY.

13:29 EQUITY FUTURES POSITIVE BY ONE THIRD OF 1%.

13:31 HERE IS YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF.

13:36 >> THE SWISS NATIONAL BANK CUTTING ITS KEY INTEREST RATE

13:40 BY 25 BASIS POINTS ACTING MONTHS AHEAD OF THE FED AND ECB.

13:45 OFFICIALS LOWERING THE RATE TO 1.5%.

13:48 SOME WERE BETTING ON A CUT BUT MOST ECONOMISTS PREDICTED THE

13:53 RATE WOULD STAY UNCHANGED UNTIL AT LEAST JUNE.

13:56 THE FRANK TUMBLING AFTER THE DECISION FALLING 1% AGAINST THE

14:00 EURO TO ITS WEAKEST LEVEL SINCE JULY OF 2023.

14:02 JOB CUTS ARE COMING AT BARCLAYS. THE U.K.

14:07 BANK IS PREPARING TO CUT SEVERAL -- SEVERAL HUNDRED JOBS.

14:11 THE MOVE COMES AS A YEAR-LONG EFFORT TO TRIM COSTS AND WITHIN

14:13 THE UNIT.

14:21 ASTERA LABS MARKING THE BEST GAINS FOR A U.S. IPO SINCE 20.

14:24 SHARES ROSE MORE THAN 70%.

14:31 GIVE ME COMPANY A MARKET VALUE AND ADDING MOMENTUM TO THE AI

14:32 STOCK FRENZY. THE LISTING IS THE FOURTH

14:37 LARGEST IN THE U.S. THIS YEAR ACCORDING TO DATA

14:38 FILED BY BLOOMBERG. THAT'S YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF.

14:43 >> RELAXING THE RULES FOR EV'S.

14:47 >> THE CONSUMER PUSHING IN A DIRECTION.

14:51 AS WE LOOK IN THE NEAR TERM, WE SEE HYBRIDS CONTINUE TO GAIN IN

14:53 POPULARITY. I THINK WE WILL SEE MARKETS

14:56 HEAD TOWARDS HYBRIDS. JONATHAN: THE LATEST ON POLICY AND THE

15:00 NATIONS CAPITAL UP NEXT FROM NEW YORK CITY. GOOD MORNING.

15:07 ♪

15:23 >> THE RALLY CONTINUES. ANOTHER THIRD OF 1% ON THE S&P

15:27 500 FOLLOWING AN ALL-TIME HIGH AT THE CLOSE YESTERDAY.

15:30 RECALLING THE RALLY AT THE BOND MARKET.

15:33 WE ARE LOWER AGAIN AND YIELD DOWN ON US FIVE BASIS POINTS.

15:39 UNDER SURVEILLANCE THIS MORNING, RELAXING THE RULES FOR

15:43 EV'S.

15:44 >> IT'S A MAJOR PART OF THE ECONOMY, IT'S A LARGER PORTION

15:48 OF THE BASE WHEN YOU GET INTO THE SECONDARY MARKET IT'S TWICE

15:51 THAT SO IF YOU WERE TRYING TO DRIVE AND SUPPORT AN ECONOMY

15:52 THIS IS WHERE YOU WOULD START.

15:59 AS WE LOOK AT THIS IN THE NEAR TERM WE WILL SEE HIGHER RATES

16:03 CONTINUING TO GAIN IN POPULARITY.

16:05 I THINK WE WILL SEE MARKETS HEAD TOWARDS HYBRIDS.

16:09 >> THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION EASING PLANS REGULATIONS ON THE

16:13 AUTO SECTOR MAKING ROOM FOR HYBRIDS AND THE PUSH FOR MORE

16:18 ELECTRIC VEHICLES. THE NEW RULE GIVING AUTOMAKERS

16:21 MORE TIME TO COMPLY WITH STRICTER 2030 AFTER WARNING

16:22 FROM INDUSTRY AND LABOR LEADERS. THIS FEELS LIKE A WIN FOR THE

16:31 TRADITIONAL AUTOMAKERS WHO MANY ARE CONSIDERING LEANING INTO

16:34 HYBRIDS A LITTLE BIT MORE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS AND PERHAPS

16:35 OVER THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE AS WELL. CRAIG:

16:40 IT'S A SORT OF BOWING TO REALITY, THE BIDEN

16:44 ADMINISTRATION SEEING THE CHALLENGES THEY ARE HAVING SORT

16:48 OF GETTING THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE SALES GOING.

16:51 WE LOOK OUT EIGHT YEARS FROM NOW IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT

16:56 WE WILL GET TO THESE NUMBERS THAT ARE SORT OF IMPLIED BY

16:57 THESE RULES. IF WE LOOK BACK EIGHT YEARS AGO

17:02 I WOULD'VE CALLED YOU CRAZY TO SAY THE MODEL WHY WAS GOING TO

17:06 BE ONE OF THE BEST-SELLING VEHICLES IN THE WORLD AND SO

17:10 THIS IS AN INDUSTRY THAT HAS BEEN CHANGING REALLY QUICKLY

17:15 MUCH AS WE HAVE SEEN THIS REAL SUBSTANTIAL SLOWDOWN LATELY IN

17:19 TERMS OF MOMENTUM FOR EV'S I DO THINK WE WILL SEE BOTH MORE OF

17:25 HYBRIDIZING, MAY BE IN THE PASTORAL WOULD'VE BEEN

17:29 COMBUSTION CARS AND STILL SOME CONTINUED EFFORT AGAIN.

17:34 THE CONSUMER INTERESTED IN GOING FULLY ELECTRIC AS WELL.

17:38 >> THERE IS THIS QUESTION OF WHETHER IT SIGNIFYING SOME SORT

17:39 OF SHIFT IN THE ADMINISTRATION STANCE.

17:44 NOT NECESSARILY TRYING TO SUPPORT ELECTRIC VEHICLES PER

17:48 SE BUT OVERALL TARGETING EMISSIONS WITH A GREATER

17:50 ACCEPTANCE OF WHATEVER MEANS THEY USED TO GET THERE.

17:54 IS THAT AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF HOW THE ADMINISTRATION SEEMS

17:55 TO BE SLIGHTLY ALTERING ITS TONE.

17:59 >> I THINK THAT'S RIGHT AND I DO THINK THIS WAS A RULEMAKING

18:03 PROCESS THAT WAS PRETTY TENSE WHERE YOU HAD SOME PUSHBACK ON

18:08 THE PART OF SEVERAL AUTOMAKERS, TOYOTA AND STELLANTIS.

18:11 WHICH ARE BIG EMPLOYERS IN THE U.S.. YOU ALSO HAD REAL CONCERNS

18:15 RAISED ON THE PART OF YOU NODDED IDLE -- UNITED AUTO

18:19 WORKERS UNION. THAT WAS A KEY CONSTITUENCY FOR

18:21 PRESIDENT BIDEN. HE DID NOT WANT TO BE SORT OF

18:28 GIVING FODDER FOR PUSHBACK AGAINST HIS REELECTION

18:30 PROSPECTS. THIS IDEA HE WASN'T LOOKING OUT

18:35 FOR THE INTERESTS OF THE U.S. AUTO WORKER AND SO THE UAW HAS

18:39 A VERY INTERESTING SORT OF HISTORY OF BEING A GROUP THAT

18:44 IS VERY INVESTED IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT AND YET

18:49 THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE THREAT THIS POSES TO FOLKS WHO

18:56 WORK AT ENGINE AND TRANSMISSION COMBUSTION ASSEMBLY LINES

19:01 ACROSS THE U.S..

19:03 WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THE IDEA ELECTRIC VEHICLES HAVE FEWER

19:05 MOVING PARTS, LESS THINGS TO PUT TOGETHER.

19:10 A HUGE PART OF WHAT IS POTENTIALLY DISRUPTIVE HERE IS

19:14 SOME OF THESE LESS PAID ATTENTION TO FACTORIES BUT DO

19:18 SOME OF THE POWER IN TERMS OF THE VEHICLES TOGETHER. LISA:

19:22 WE ARE HEARING A LOT OF THE RHETORIC OF HOW THE AUTO

19:25 INDUSTRY IS JUST PURELY DRIVEN TOWARDS THE ELECTION.

19:29 ALONG WITH THE PROPOSALS WHETHER IT IS SOME OF THE

19:35 CHANGES TO THIS ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH OR

19:38 WHETHER IT'S STRUMS TALK ABOUT MAYBE 100% TARIFFS ON CHINESE

19:39 MADE VEHICLES COMING IN FROM MEXICO.

19:43 IS THIS JUST TALK TO GET AHEAD OF THE ELECTION.

19:47 >> IT WAS INTERESTING TO HEAR SOME OF THIS RHETORIC OUT OF

19:53 TRUMP BECAUSE THE NUMBERS HE'S THROWING AROUND HAVE BEEN ALL

19:55 OVER THE PLACE IN TERMS OF WHAT HE'S GOING TO DO.

20:00 BUT I THINK GENERALLY WE ARE GOING TO HEAR MORE AND MORE OF

20:04 THIS RHETORIC ABOUT THE THREAT BIDEN'S EFFORTS TO ELECTRIFY

20:10 THE INDUSTRY POSES. THERE IS A VALIDITY TO THIS

20:14 IDEA IT WILL BE A DISRUPTIVE FORCE SO EVEN AS WORKERS MAYBE

20:21 ARE WILLING TO HEAR BIDEN SAY HE'S LOOKING OUT FOR THEM,

20:23 THERE IS A REAL CONCERN ABOUT JUST HOW MUCH THERE IS A SORT

20:28 OF WILLINGNESS TO CHANGE BECAUSE THIS IS AN INDUSTRY

20:33 WHERE A LOT OF THE FOLKS WHO HAVE WORKED ON THESE ASSEMBLY

20:35 LINES IN THESE FACTORIES HAVE DONE SO FOR DECADES.

20:39 IF YOU ARE GOING TO FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THIS

20:42 INDUSTRY, THAT'S REQUIRING A LEAP OF FAITH.

20:48 YOU ARE SEEING TRUMP SORT OF CDS ON THAT WILLINGNESS TO

20:50 SECOND-GUESS WHAT BIDEN'S TALKING ABOUT AND YET THIS IS

20:56 SOMETHING BIDEN CAN TALK -- .2 AS AN ACHIEVEMENT IN TERMS OF

20:59 WHAT GIVE THE IRA HAS ACCOMPLISHED.

21:03 >> I'M THINKING OF DETROIT THIS MORNING.

21:06 THEY'VE GOT CLARITY ON POLICY NOW, THEY CAN REALLY START TO

21:10 PLAN. MARY WAS STARTING TO CONSIDER

21:12 GOING BACK TO HYBRIDS. SOMETHING THERE WERE RELUCTANT

21:14 TO DO. WHAT YOU THINK THE NEXT MOVE IS

21:18 FROM SOME OF THESE AUTOMAKERS?

21:23 >> I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE THE CASE THE GENERALLY COMBUSTION

21:28 ONLY IS JUST NOT GOING TO CUT IT ANYMORE.

21:33 IN ORDER TO COME ANYWHERE CLOSE TO WHERE THESE RULES OR

21:37 REQUIRING, YOU NEED TO AT LEAST PARTIALLY ELECTRIFY VIRTUALLY

21:42 ANYTHING.

21:43 WHETHER THAT MEANS SLOWING DOWN SOME OF THE FULLY ELECTRIC MOVE

21:48 I THINK WE ARE SEEING THAT IN TERMS OF GETTING COLD FEET

21:52 ABOUT HOW READY THE CONSUMER IS TO GO FULLY ELECTRIC.

21:56 YOU CAN OFFER CONVENTIONAL HYBRIDS THAT DON'T EVEN HAVE A

21:59 PLUG AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT BRINGING THE

22:04 CONSUMER ALONG EVEN TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY INSTALL A PLUG-IN

22:05 IN THEIR GARAGE. EVEN JUST GOING IN THE

22:10 DIRECTION OF PARTIALLY ELECTRIFYING COMBUSTION ENGINES

22:14 WILL GO A LONG WAY TO REDUCING THE EMISSIONS OF THE FLEET AND

22:21 GETTING THE CONSUMER USED TO THIS IDEA THERE ARE REASONS

22:27 THIS CAN IF YOU GET A LITTLE BIT OF EXTRA OWN FALL OFF THE

22:31 LINE, THAT MAY SORT OF OPEN THE EYES OF THE CONSUMER OF MAYBE

22:34 THIS ISN'T SO BAD AFTER ALL.

22:36 >> I TRIED TO GET SOME DETAIL. I WONDER IF YOU KNOW WHERE THIS

22:42 IS GOING, HOW EASY IS THIS TO TRANSITION TO START MAKING

22:47 HYBRIDS.

22:48 >> I LISTEN TO YOUR INTERVIEW A FEW WEEKS BACK AND SHE WAS A

22:49 LITTLE BIT CAGEY ABOUT THIS. IT IS NOT GOING TO BE SORT OF

22:57 SNAP YOUR FINGERS AND THIS SHIFT OVER TO HYBRIDS.

22:59 THIS WILL BE SOMETHING THAT WILL PLAY OUT PROBABLY GOING TO

23:04 TAKE GM A GOOD YEAR AND A HALF BEFORE WE START TO SEE SOME OF

23:07 THIS DECISION THAT WE'VE MADE IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS TO

23:12 REALLY SORT OF COME TO FRUITION FOR US TO SEE THIS END PRODUCT

23:17 OF MORE HYBRIDS AVAILABLE YOUR DEALERSHIP.

23:20 >> IT'S A NOTICEABLE SHIFT, THANK YOU.

23:22 THE LATEST FROM THE EPA. THE ADMINISTRATION ATTEMPTING

23:28 TO SPEAK OUT OF BOTH SIDES OF THEIR MOUTH I GUEST BECAUSE ON

23:30 THE ONE HAND YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO CLIMATE ACTIVISTS WE ARE

23:33 GOING HARD AND GOING TO BE TOUGH.

23:38 AUTO WORKERS IN DETROIT TO SAY THEY ARE NOT GOING AS HARD WE

23:40 CAN DO OTHER THINGS AS WELL.

23:43 >> WHICH MEANS ARE WE LOOKING AT A POLICY SHIFTING OR LOOKING

23:46 AT RHETORIC THAT SHIFTED AHEAD OF THE ELECTION.

23:48 IF WE HEAR WHAT CRAG IS TALKING ABOUT.

23:54 THE FACT THESE RULES WERE ALTERED BASED ON THE FEEDBACK

23:55 FROM THE AUTO MANUFACTURERS IN THE UNITED STATES.

23:57 IT FEELS LIKE THIS IS A SLIGHT SHIFT.

24:03 IT'S LESS ON ELECTRIC VEHICLE SUBSIDIES IN THE SAME WAY.

24:06 TO ME HAD THERE WILL BE HISTORY BOOKS WRITTEN ABOUT WHETHER

24:10 THIS INDICATES THE END OF AN ERA WITH SOME OF THE DREAMS OF

24:11 THAT. JONATHAN: IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE I

24:14 THINK.

24:20 ULTIMATELY THIS IS WHERE THE MARKET IS PAID THE MARKET HAS

24:23 SPOKEN AND THEY'VE HAD TO LISTEN OTHERWISE YOU WILL GET

24:25 AUTOMAKERS IN DETROIT IN A BIG MESS.

24:28 EQUITY FUTURES POSITIVE BY ONE THIRD OF 1%. THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

24:43 JONATHAN: WHAT A MOVE YESTERDAY ON THE

24:44 EQUITY MARKET. CHAIRMAN POWELL, EQUITY FUTURES

24:53 NOW ADDING SOME MORE WEIGHT ON THE NASDAQ UP BY 0.7.

24:55 SOME ALL CAPS OUTPERFORMING. BIGGEST DAY OF GAINS IN ABOUT A

24:58 MONTH. UP AGAIN BY 0.6%. LET'S TURN TO FIXED INCOME.

25:07 DOWN ANOTHER FOUR BASIS POINTS NOW.

25:13 LISA THAT'S QUITE A TURNAROUND OVER THE LAST FOUR DAYS. LISA:

25:18 TRADERS ARE PRICING IN A CHANCE OF A JUNE RATE CUT.

25:22 THAT'S UP FROM A DAY BEFORE THE PRESS CONFERENCE.

25:28 BASICALLY SAYING WE ARE GOING TO CUT RATES SO STOP IT WITH

25:30 THINKING THIS WAS SOMEHOW CHANGED ALL PICTURE.

25:33 THE MARKET GOT THE MESSAGE LOUD AND CLEAR AND IT'S OFF TO THE

25:37 RACES. JONATHAN: DOVISH HITS AFTER HAWKISH

25:39 KNOCKS. LISA: IT'S A LINEUP WHICH IS

25:43 ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE SAW. JONATHAN:

25:47 THIS IS A DIFFERENT FED CHAIR THAN WHAT WE SAW IN AUGUST.

25:49 COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. LISA: I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS RAID

25:54 THERE WAS A QUESTION OF ARE WE LOOKING AT A TIME WHERE YOU

26:00 HAVE FISCAL STIMULUS COMING IN STILL FULL FORCE AND THEN

26:02 YOU'VE GOT MONETARY STIMULUS ON THE EDGES STARTING TO COME BACK.

26:06 WHAT HAPPENS IN THE FIGHT BETWEEN THESE TWO?

26:08 THEY ARE IN SYNC. IT'S A GREEN LIGHT TO STOCKS

26:11 AND FOR RISK ASSETS. IS THERE A CONSEQUENCE OR IS

26:17 THIS JUST A GOLDEN ERA OF INCREDIBLE GROWTH IN STIMULUS.

26:21 JONATHAN: THERE WERE MANY OTHER CONSEQUENCES AS WELL.

26:23 LET'S TURN TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

26:26 THE MOMENT. A SURPRISE MOVE FROM SWITZERLAND.

26:30 THE SWISS NATIONAL BANK CUTTING RATES.

26:33 WHAT DO YOU HAVE, A WEAKER SWISS FRANC. OUT BY ABOUT 0.7%.

26:40 I THINK ABOUT 90 MINUTES AWAY WE WILL HEAR FROM THE BOE.

26:42 WHAT INTERESTS ME ABOUT THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS THERE ARE A

26:47 COUPLE OF MEMBERS WHO WILL END UP SAYING I THINK WE SHOULD

26:49 HIKE INTEREST RATES. I WONDER IF THE RECENT DATA

26:53 CLIPS THE WORDS OF THE HAWKS AT THE BANK OF ENGLAND. LISA:

26:58 DO WE END UP WITH A UNANIMOUS VOTE AT LEAST THAT THE GOAL IS

27:02 DOWN, BECAUSE THAT WAS SORT OF ONE OF THE TENSIONS OF THE BANK

27:06 OF ENGLAND. THEY ARE LOOKING AT A DIFFERENT

27:07 GROWTH BACKDROP IN A DIFFERENT KIND OF DOMINANCE OF THE

27:08 CURRENCY. FOR THE BANK OF ENGLAND IT'S

27:16 THIS DELEGATE DANCE ESPECIALLY AS THEY DEAL WITH THE DEFICIT

27:22 AND GROWTH BRING JONATHAN: FLOCK OF DOVES WHICH IS WHAT IT

27:23 FEELS LIKE THE LAST DAY OR SO. UNDER SURVEILLANCE, FED CHAIR

27:28 JAY POWELL STAYING ON MESSAGE FOR STOCKS AND BONDS INSISTING

27:32 TOLERANCE FOR INFLATION HAS NOT SHIFTED.

27:39 >> WHAT IT MEANS IS WE'VE SEEN IN COMING AS I POINTED OUT IN

27:43 MY OPENING REMARKS WE DIDN'T MARK UP OUR GROWTH FORECAST.

27:47 THE ECONOMY IS PERFORMING WELL.

27:53 THE INFLATION DATA CAME IN HIGHER AS A SEPARATE MATTER AND

27:56 THAT CAUSED PEOPLE TO BRING UP THEIR INFLATION.

27:59 NONETHELESS WE CONTINUE TO MAKE GOOD PROGRESS ON BRINGING

28:02 INFLATION DOWN. JONATHAN: I THINK THOSE COMMENTS ARE SO

28:05 IMPORTANT. THERE WAS A CLEAR AND WE

28:10 THOUGHT OBVIOUS CONTRADICTION OF THE FORECAST OF 2024 AND IT

28:13 GOES OF THE SUMMARY OF ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS.

28:17 GROWTH COMES UP BY QUITE A LOT. UNEMPLOYMENT COMES DOWN.

28:22 CPI REVISED HIGHER BY JUST A LITTLE BIT AND THEN YOU

28:24 BASICALLY SING THE MEDIAN. IS UNCHANGED EVEN THOUGH GROWTH

28:26 WILL BE STRONGER AND INFLATION WILL BE HIGHER.

28:32 IT RAISED THE QUESTION FOR BOTH OF US ARE THEY WILLING TO

28:33 TOLERATE HIGHER INFLATION. WHAT GIVES.

28:36 THEN YOU GET THAT RESPONSE THERE AND HE REFERS TO

28:41 INFLATION. IT WAS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER AS A

28:45 SEPARATE MATTER, DISTINCT FROM WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH ECONOMIC

28:49 GROWTH. THEY MADE THAT POINT

28:51 REPEATEDLY, STRONGER GROWTH IS NOT SOMETHING WE ARE CONCERNED

28:53 ABOUT AT THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND WE HEARD THE SAME MESSAGE

28:55 OF THE END OF JANUARY. LISA: I SHRUGGED IT OFF AS MAYBE HE'S

29:03 JUST TRYING TO HIM AND HAW GIVEN THE FACT IT'S NOT SOME

29:05 SORT OF COHESIVE MESSAGE FROM FED MEMBERS.

29:06 IT'S EACH ONE OF THEM COMING UP WITH THEIR OWN GUIDELINES.

29:10 RICK REEDER OF BLACK ROCK HAD AN INTERESTING POINT WHICH IS

29:12 INFLATION HAS NOT BEEN A FUNCTION OF FED POLICY ON THE

29:14 WAY UP OR DOWN. AND THIS IS INDEPENDENT AND

29:19 SOME OF THE INTEREST-RATE SENSITIVE AREAS OF THE MARKET

29:21 AREN'T FUELING THE INFLATION. SO THE FED IS KIND OF IMPOTENT

29:27 AND WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO IS GAUGE HOW NOT TO BECOME PART

29:30 OF THE PROBLEM AS SOME OF THESE OTHER AREAS RIGHT SIZE.

29:35 HAS THE FED LOST CONTROL OVER THE INFLATION NARRATIVE

29:38 ENTIRELY WHICH IS THE REASON WHY STOCK MARKETS ARE MOVING.

29:42 >> RICK'S COLLEAGUE JOINED THE PROGRAM. HE WAS FANTASTIC.

29:46 CAN YOU GIVE US EVIDENCE OF HOW WE ARE SUFFICIENTLY RESTRICTIVE.

29:50 HE'LL POINT TO THE LABOR MARKET. YOU ASK ABOUT THE LOOSENING

29:54 WE'VE SEEN THERE. THEY WILL POINT TO THE SUPPLY

29:57 SIDE OF THE LABOR MARKET. THEY WON'T EVEN MENTION WHAT'S

30:03 HAPPENING WITH DEMAND BECAUSE IT'S NOT ABOUT INTEREST RATES,

30:05 IT'S ABOUT IMMIGRATION WHICH IS WHAT WE HEARD REPEATEDLY FROM

30:07 ECONOMIST ON WALL STREET.

30:12 >> IT SO DIFFICULT TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING COHESIVE AND

30:15 UNDERSTANDABLE TO SAY. WE FIND OURSELVES OF THE POLICY

30:20 INTEREST-RATE STRUCTURE THAN SOME WAYS IS INEFFICIENT

30:23 SLOWING SOME SEGMENT OF THE ECONOMY QUITE A BIT WITH HIGH

30:26 RATES WHILE APPEARING QUITE INEFFECTIVE IN REDUCING

30:29 ACTIVITY OR PRICE GATES AND MANY OF THE SERVICE SECTORS OF

30:33 THE ECONOMY. IF THE FED IS INEFFECTIVE, ARE

30:35 WE BASICALLY SAYING WE DON'T WANT TO SLOW THINGS MATERIALLY

30:39 ON THE OTHERS AND THEN WHAT'S CAN OFFSET THE OTHER PART.

30:45 IS IT GOING TO BE IMMIGRATION, SUPPLY-SIDE RESPONSES SAYING

30:49 OVER TO YOU GOVERNMENT. JONATHAN:

30:51 I FINISHED THE NEWS CONFERENCE I THINK WE BOTH SAID THE EQUITY

30:55 MARKET BOWLS WOULD JUST LIKE TO HEAR THAT NEWS CONFERENCE OFF

30:56 AND ON. MAYBE JUST WANTS TO REPLAY THE

30:58 WHOLE THING. WHICH IS REPLAY THE NEWS

31:03 CONFERENCE FOR 60 MINUTES BACK-TO-BACK FOR THE NEXT THREE

31:04 HOURS. WE ARE KNOCKING TO DO THAT WE

31:08 WILL TALK ABOUT APPLE. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS

31:12 SET TO SUE APPLE AS SOON AS TODAY FOR ALLEGED ANTITRUST

31:16 VIOLATIONS. BLOOMBERG REPORTING THE DOJ

31:17 WILL ACCUSE THE WORLD'S SECOND MOST VALUABLE TECH COMPANY OF

31:20 BLOCKING RIVALS FROM ACCESSING HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE FEATURES

31:22 ON THE IPHONE. THIS WOULD BE IN ADDITION TO

31:24 THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S OTHER ANTITRUST SUITS, THE DOJ

31:29 HAS A LAWSUIT AGAINST ALPHABET ACCUSING GOOGLE OF

31:34 MONOPOLIZATION AND THE FTC IS PURSUING ACTION AGAINST META

31:36 AND AMAZON AS WELL. THEY ARE NOT IN A GOOD SPOT.

31:41 -7% YEAR-TO-DATE.

31:45 >> WHICH IS INTERESTING GIVEN THEY ARE QUITE KEEN ON THE

31:46 ANTITRUST EFFORTS. PEOPLE LOOKING FOR SOME SORT OF

31:52 DIFFERENT ANTITRUST APPROACH WITH A CHANGE IN

31:55 ADMINISTRATION, THIS CASE WAS OPENING 2019 UNDER THE FORMER

31:58 PRESIDENT TRUMP. WE ARE LOOKING AT EITHER

32:00 CANDIDATE CONTINUING THIS ANTITRUST TYPE OF ACTION WHICH

32:04 IS COMPELLING TO ME GIVEN A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT SEEMED

32:05 POLARIZING.

32:12 JONATHAN: GOING INTO THE SELECTION LATER

32:13 THIS YEAR PRAYED LET'S TURN TO FOREIGN POLICY.

32:17 JAKE SULLIVAN MAKING A SURPRISE TRIP TO UKRAINE.

32:20 LOOKING TO ASSURE ALLIES EIGHT WILL BE DELIVERED FOR THE

32:21 COUNTRY'S DEFENSE AGAINST RUSSIA.

32:27 SULLIVAN SAYING YOU'LL GET A STRONG BIPARTISAN VOTE IN THE

32:28 HOUSE. I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO SPEAK

32:29 ABOUT A PLAN B. SPEAKER JOHNSON IS REFUSED ACT

32:36 ON AN AID PACKAGE PASSED BY THE SENATE TO INCLUDE SUPPORT FOR

32:37 UKRAINE, ISRAEL AND TAIWAN. JUST AS LEADERS START TO

32:42 REGROUP IN EUROPE AND TALK ABOUT WHAT TO DO NEXT, LET'S

32:45 GET TO THAT. CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW MUCH

32:50 DISTANCE IS THERE BETWEEN MACRON AND EVERYONE ELSE?

32:53 LESLIE: THERE IS A DIVIDE AND MACRON IS

32:57 PUSHING FORWARD, SETTING FRANCE OUT AS A LEADER WITH THE

33:00 POSSIBILITY OF WESTERN TROOPS IN UKRAINE IS NOT UNTHINKABLE

33:04 AT THIS MEETING DOUBLING DOWN ON HOW DOES EUROPE WORK

33:09 TOGETHER TO INCREASE BASICALLY IT'S REARMAMENT AND HOW DOES IT

33:10 FIND ITSELF. THAT'S THE BIG QUESTION HERE.

33:18 I THINK AS YOU SUGGESTED THAT FRANCE IS DISTINCT IN ITS VIEWS

33:23 FROM GERMANY, THE U.K. AND EVEN FROM THE U.S..

33:30 BUT THERE ARE OTHERS IN EUROPE, THOSE CLOSER TO RUSSIA WHO

33:36 SHARE THIS VIEW AND INTERESTINGLY SOME LEADING

33:39 COMMENTATORS, FAREED DZHOKHAR YOU CAME OUT WITH AN OP-ED

33:46 SAYING SIMILAR SAYING THE WORST THING WOULD BE FOR PRUDENT TO

33:49 WIN IN WESTERN TROOPS OF SOME FORM ON THE GROUND SHOULD NOT

33:53 BE UNTHINKABLE. THERE IS MOMENTUM IN THE

33:54 BACKDROP TO ALL OF THIS IS OF COURSE THAT ONGOING FEAR THAT

33:58 AMERICA WILL NOT DELIVER THE AMOUNT OF MONEY NECESSARY TO

34:03 REALLY CONTINUE TO SUSTAIN THAT SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE EVEN UNDER

34:07 BIDENS LEADERSHIP AND SOMETHING THAT COULD CHANGE QUITE

34:10 DRAMATICALLY OR TRUMP TO BE ELECTED.

34:13 I DO THINK WHAT WE ARE HEARING NOW IS THAT SUPPLEMENTAL BILL

34:16 THAT THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE WILL ALLOW THAT TO GO FORWARD

34:21 AND THERE WILL BE FUNDING BUT THAT'S NOT REASSURANCE FOR VERY

34:26 LONG THAT IT WILL BE ENOUGH AND THEY NEED TO STEP UP. LISA:

34:33 ON THAT EXISTENTIAL CONCEPT, HOW MUCH DISCUSSION IS THERE OF

34:37 THE WAYS TO FINANCE THIS AKIN TO WHAT EMMANUEL MACRON WAS

34:40 TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY THE KEY STRUGGLE.

34:46 HOW DO YOU PAY FOR SUPPORTING UKRAINE BY EUROPE ALSO

34:47 INVESTING IN SOME OF THE MILITARY STRENGTH AND THE HALF

34:52 THE FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ASKING FOR AND FRANKLY THEY

34:53 FEEL LIKE THEY WILL NEED ESPECIALLY WITHOUT NECESSARILY

34:55 IN THE U.S.. LESLIE: THERE'S AN URGENT QUESTION

35:05 ABOUT HOW EUROPE CONTRIBUTES TO DEFENDING UKRAINE AND GETTING

35:06 THOSE ARMAMENTS THERE AND HOW THEY PAY FOR THAT.

35:10 THEN THERE WAS A LONGER-TERM QUESTION WHICH SPEAKS TO THE

35:13 PRESSURE FROM THE FORMER PRESIDENT BUT QUITE FRANKLY

35:16 FROM MULTIPLE U.S. PRESIDENTS AND ONE THAT WE'VE

35:18 SUSTAINED REGARDLESS OF WHOSE ELECTED.

35:23 BUT ON THE QUESTION OF BONDS, THAT WILL BE CONTROVERSIAL.

35:25 IT STRIKES ME AS UNLIKELY TO MOVE FORWARD.

35:29 THERE'S THE BROADER QUESTION OF USING RUSSIA'S CENTRAL BANK

35:33 FROZEN ASSETS. THAT I THINK IS GETTING A LOT

35:36 OF TRACTION BUT THIS QUESTION OF FINANCING, THE SUPPORT FOR

35:42 ARMAMENTS IS CRITICAL AT A TIME WHEN EUROPEAN ECONOMIES ARE OF

35:45 COURSE NOT STRONG ON THE WHOLE. SO THIS MEETING TODAY IS VERY

35:51 IMPORTANT AND ONCE AGAIN MACRON IS AN OUTLIER AND SETTING FORTH

35:56 A BOLD VISION THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT.

36:00 >>, TALK WITH US FROZEN ASSETS.

36:06 IS IT VERY SPECIFIC OBSTACLE A LEGAL ISSUE, A SPECIFIC COUNTRY

36:08 THAT'S DOING SO. WHERE IS THE HOLDUP COMING FROM?

36:14 LESLIE: MANY SEE THIS AS BREAKING A

36:18 FUNDAMENTAL NORM, A SHIFT IN OPINION, OF THE DEBATE HAS BEEN

36:19 GOING ON FOR A LONG TIME. THE OPINION HAS SHIFTED IN

36:25 FAVOR AND THERE IS A QUESTION OF EXACTLY WHAT ARE THOSE

36:30 ASSETS USED TO FINANCE AND THAT'S A LINE MANY PEOPLE DRAW

36:32 IN DIFFERENT PLACES. SOME DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE

36:37 USED TO FINANCE THE DIRECT PURCHASE OF ARMAMENTS.

36:42 SOME HAVE WANTED TO FOCUS PRIMARILY ON THE DAY AFTER ON

36:46 UKRAINIAN RECONSTRUCTION BUT OF COURSE THAT DAY AFTER YOU ONLY

36:51 GET THERE BY CHANGING THE BALANCE OF POWER ON THE GROUND

36:55 GETTING TO SOME SORT OF PEACE SO THERE'S ONCE AGAIN A

36:59 QUESTION OF URGENCY BUT THERE IS A LEGAL AND NORMATIVE

37:02 POSITION THAT DIVIDES MANY PEOPLE ACROSS EUROPE AND IN THE

37:07 UNITED STATES. JONATHAN: LESLIE, THANK YOU.

37:10 IT'S DIFFICULT A LOT OF THIS MONEY IN THOSE ASSETS ARE IN

37:11 SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.

37:17 WHAT YOU HAVE IS HOW DO YOU CONFISCATE ASSETS FROM A

37:19 COUNTRY YOU ARE NOT IN DIRECT CONFLICT WITH AND THAT'S THE

37:20 CONVERSATION WE BEEN HAVING FOR QUITE A WHILE. LISA:

37:28 HOW DO YOU MOVE FORWARD IN THE MARKETPLACE THAT YOU'RE A SORT

37:31 OF LOYAL STEWARD OF THE MONEY YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN TO HOLD

37:34 CUSTODY OF IT'S A DIFFICULT MOMENT AND THIS IS SOMETHING WE

37:38 KEEP TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS HOW DO COUNTRIES LOSE THE ABILITY

37:40 TO ACT WITH IMPUNITY. HOW LONG CAN THEIR HISTORICAL

37:46 POWER GET THEM THROUGH AN ERA WHERE THEY ARE CHANGING THE

37:47 RULES IN REAL TIME. JONATHAN:

37:53 EQUITY FUTURES ON THE S&P 500 POSITIVE BY 0.3%.

37:56 YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF. YAHAIRA: THE U.S.

38:01 IS PUSHING FOR AN IMMEDIATE CEASE-FIRE IN GAZA TIED TO THE

38:05 RELEASE OF HOSTAGES HELD BY HAMAS.

38:11 ANTONY BLINKEN SAYS THE U.S. IS CIRCULATING A DRAFT

38:12 RESOLUTION AT THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL CALLING FOR A TEMPORARY

38:15 PAUSE IN THE WAR. THIS MARKING A CHANGE.

38:20 UNTIL NOW THE U.S. USE ITS VETO POWER TO BLOCK

38:24 CALLS FOR A CEASE FIRE.

38:33 REDDIT WILL BEGIN TRADING TODAY. THE PRICE OF THE TOP OF THE

38:37 EXPECTED RANGE. THE OFFERING VALUES THE HIM WAS

38:41 $6.5 BILLION. CHAIRS -- SHARES WILL TRADE ON

38:46 THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE UNDER RDDT.

38:51 WE WILL HAVE AN INTERVIEW WITH THEIR CEO LIVE 11:45 EASTERN.

38:54 L.A. DODGERS FIRING THE INTERPRETER

38:57 FOR SUPERSTAR PLAYER SHOW HEY OTANI.

39:02 THE PLAYERS LONGTIME FRIEND AND INTERPRETER RACKED UP DEBTS TO

39:03 A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BOOKMAKING OPERATION WHICH IS

39:06 UNDER FEDERAL SCRUTINY. QUESTIONS WERE RAISED AFTER AT

39:11 LEAST $4.5 MILLION IN WIRE TRANSFERS WERE SENT FROM THE

39:17 BASEBALLS -- BASEBALL PLAYERS BACON COUNT TO A BOOKMAKER.

39:21 OTANI -- BANK ACCOUNT TO A BOOKMAKER. JONATHAN:

39:25 THAT STORY IS NUTS. LISA: HE ALLOWED FOR A 4.5 MILLION

39:30 DOLLARS TRANSFER OF FUNDS. THE DODGERS ORGANIZATION

39:34 DOESN'T MATTER. JONATHAN: IT'S LIKE SMALL CHANGE.

39:43 UP NEXT ON THIS PROGRAM, THE FED STAYING ON MESSAGE.

39:48 >> THE UNDERLYING STORY HASN'T CHANGED.

39:51 WE DIDN'T BUY INTO OUR GOOD THE INFLATION NUMBERS WERE IN THE

39:53 SECOND HALF. WE ARE NOT COMPLETELY PUT OFF

39:58 BY THE BAD INFLATION READS IN JANUARY FEBRUARY. JONATHAN:

40:01 THIS IS BLOOMBERG. ♪

40:26 JONATHAN: RECORD HIGH AT THE CLOSE

40:27 YESTERDAY. GOOD MORNING TO ALL AND WELCOME

40:29 TO THE PROGRAM. YIELDS ARE LITTLE BIT LOWER

40:34 AGAIN DOWN ANOTHER FOUR BASIS POINTS. EURO NOT DOING MUCH.

40:41 UNDER SURVEILLANCE THIS MORNING THE FED STAYING ON MESSAGE.

40:45 >> OUR BASIC MESSAGE IS THE UNDERLYING STORY HAS NOT

40:49 CHANGED. WE DID NOT COMPLETELY BUY INTO

40:52 OUT QUICKLY INFLATION NUMBERS WERE IN THE SECOND HALF OF NEXT

40:57 YEAR.

40:58 WE WERE NOT PUT OFF BY JANUARY FEBRUARY.

41:01 WE STILL THINK MONETARY POLICY IS TIGHT.

41:03 WE WILL GET INFLATION DOWN AND SO WE STILL THINK WE WILL CUT

41:07 RATES THIS YEAR.

41:08 >> THE POST FED RALLY CONTINUES AFTER THE CENTRAL BANK

41:11 REITERATED ITS OUTLOOK FOR RATE CUTS THIS YEAR.

41:17 THIS IS A FED THAT WANTS TO CUT RATE -- CUT RATES.

41:20 THERE IS STILL TIME BEFORE THE JUNE MEETING FOR THE DATA TO

41:23 FALL INTO PLACE ALTHOUGH THE NARRATIVE HAS BEEN CHALLENGED.

41:26 THE CHAIRMAN SAYS HE'S COMMITTED TO GETTING INFLATION

41:29 BACK DOWN TO 2%. TO THOSE PROJECTIONS LOOK AT

41:32 THEIR COMMITTED TO GETTING BACK DOWN TO 2%.

41:35 >> HE'S MORE COMMITTED TO GETTING THE U.S.

41:39 ECONOMY MOVING FORWARD. HE'S INDICATED THEY'RE HAPPY TO

41:43 TOLERATE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER INFLATION AND MAKING SURE WE DO

41:44 KEEP THE SOFT LANDING IN PLACE. THAT SEEMS TO BE HIS MAIN GOAL.

41:48 I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING DIFFERENT. JONATHAN:

41:52 IF THAT'S THE BIG TAKE AWAY DESPITE THE FACT THE DATA HAS

41:55 CHANGED SOMEWHAT WHAT IS THAT TELL YOU THEY SHOULD DO IN

41:56 MARKETS RIGHT NOW. IAIN:

42:03 IT TELLS ME THAT PEOPLE WANT TO BE INVESTED, THAT STOCK MARKETS

42:05 ARE GOING TO DO WITH THEIR DOING OVER THE LAST FEW HOURS

42:08 AND ULTIMATELY INVESTING IN THE FIXED ON MARKETABLE ALSO MAKES

42:15 SENSE.

42:16 LISA: IS IT HERE'S THE FORK AND YOU

42:17 CAN EAT YOUR CAKE AS WELL. HOW LONG DOES IT GO ON BEFORE

42:20 THERE'S CONSEQUENCE ON THE OTHERS. WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE

42:24 BECAUSE OF A CERTAIN POINT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT DOES THIS ALLOW

42:29 INFLATION TO RUN HOTTER AND MAYBE MAKE LONGER-TERM BOND THE

42:33 OPPOSITION FOR LONGER-TERM BONDS LESS ATTRACTIVE. IAIN:

42:37 THEY DO BELIEVE THEY'VE GOT INFLATION COMING DOWN UNDER

42:38 CONTROL. MAYBE THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS

42:43 THEY ARE WILLING TO LOOK THROUGH THAT AND SEE THE

42:45 DOWNWARD TRAJECTORY IS STILL THERE.

42:50 I THINK THEY GENUINELY BELIEVE THEY ARE IN RESTRICTIVE

42:53 TERRITORY AND THEY DON'T THINK THEY ARE TAKING THEMSELVES IN

42:56 THE EASY TERRITORY. THEY'RE JUST TAKING A FOOT OFF

42:58 THE ACCELERATOR TO ALLOW THE ECONOMY TO CONTINUE TO GROW.

43:02 I THINK THE FIRST FEW RATE CUTS WE SEE ARE GOING TO BE DRIVEN

43:03 BY INFLATION. IF WE SEE A REALLY SERIOUS RATE

43:09 CUTTING CYCLE THROUGH OTHER CYCLES IT'S CAN IT BE A

43:11 DETERIORATION OF GROWTH AND WE ARE NOT SEEING THAT.

43:15 WE WILL HAVE A FEW RATE CUTS UNLESS THINGS GET A LOT WORSE.

43:18 LISA: TWO MARKETS AGREE THAT THEY ARE

43:19 IN RESTRICTIVE TERRITORY. IAIN: THERE ARE ALSO THOSE FINANCIAL

43:26 CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTING THE FED TO BE EASING OFF A BIT.

43:30 THERE IS STILL A LOT OF CUTS PRICED INTO THE SYSTEM WHICH IS

43:32 WHAT THE MARKET LIKES. LISA: AT WHAT POINT DOES IT STOP OR

43:37 DO YOU JUST PILE IN. I JOKED ABOUT THIS, WHY DON'T

43:42 YOU JUST LEVER UP AND PILE INTO RISK.

43:44 YOU'RE GETTING A GREEN LIGHT NOT ONLY FROM THE FED BUT ALSO

43:45 FISCAL GOVERNMENTS. IAIN: I DO STILL THINK WE'VE HAD A

43:53 LOT OF TIGHTENING AND I DON'T THINK THE LAGS HAVE BEEN AS

43:54 QUICK AS PREVIOUS CYCLES. I THINK THERE ARE CONCERNS THAT

43:58 THOSE WILL COME DOWN THE ROAD AT SOME POINT SO I DON'T THINK

44:01 YOU WANT TO BE INDISCRIMINATE. YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE IN

44:07 THE RIGHT BUT IT DOES FEEL LIKE THE CENTRAL BANKS ARE WILLING

44:11 TO CONTINUE THIS RALLY FOR THE TIME BEING. JONATHAN:

44:14 ARE WE PRETENDING THEY HAVE CONTROL OVER SOMETHING THEY

44:15 DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER? IS THAT ONE BIG GAME WE ARE ALL

44:17 PLAYING. THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS SUFFICIENTLY RESTRICTIVE.

44:25 BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE LABOR MARKET WE SPEAK TO ECONOMISTS

44:28 AS TO WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE LABOR MARKET THEY POINT TO THE

44:32 SUPPLY SIDE IS THE REASON TO WHY THINGS HAVE COOLED DOWN A

44:36 LITTLE BIT. WHAT DO YOU THINK THE FED HAS

44:39 CONTROL OVER WHEN THEY SIT HERE AND PRETEND WE ARE SUFFICIENTLY

44:44 RESTRICTIVE. IAIN:

44:45 DEFINITELY SUPPLY-SIDE HAS DRIVEN GROWTH.

44:47 INFLATION IS COMING DOWN. WE LOOK AT THE EMPLOYMENT

44:54 PICTURE IT WENT FROM A VERY HOT PERIODS, IT WAS COOLING DOWN.

45:00 SLOWING RATES, A REDUCTION, REDUCTION IN OPENINGS.

45:02 THINGS ARE HEADING IN THAT DIRECTION.

45:04 I THINK THE CENTRAL BANKS ARE LOOKING AT IT AND IT'S

45:09 HAPPENING TO GROWTH. WE CAN MAINTAIN THIS IF WE ARE

45:14 SORT OF CUTE AROUND HOW WE DEAL WITH THIS AND SOME RATE CUTS

45:15 WILL HELP THAT.

45:20 >> JUNE IS A CALL FOR YOU IF THE DATA FALLS INTO PLACE.

45:23 CAN YOU ASK PLANE WITH THAT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE, IS IT 2.5%.

45:28 I DON'T EVEN KNOW ANYMORE? WHAT IS IT? IAIN:

45:32 YOU HAVE TO SEE THEM ON A MONTHLY BASIS.

45:37 IF WE START SEEING A WHOLE LIST OF .4 IT'S GOING TO CALL THAT

45:40 INTO QUESTION BUT I ALSO THINK IN A MINDSET JAY POWELL WANTS

45:45 TO RAISE POLICY SEEMS DETERMINED. JONATHAN:

45:49 STEVE SAID THE SAME THING. THIS IS A CHAIRMAN THAT WANTS

45:52 TO CUT INTEREST RATES. IF I LOOK ACROSS THE CURVE

45:56 RIGHT NOW I CAN SEE WHY MAYBE WIND BY THE FRONT-END

46:02 TREASURIES. LOOKING FOR RATE CUTS.

46:04 I'M WONDERING IF THEY'RE WILLING TO TOLERATE HIGHER TALL

46:08 -- INFLATION HOWDY THINGS OPERATE. IAIN:

46:12 YOU DO SEE THE CURB STEEP AND UP A BIT.

46:15 MAYBE THAT'S THE FIVE-YEAR PART OF THE CURVE.

46:18 I THINK THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS. WE'VE STILL GOT THE INVERTED

46:21 YIELD CURVE. WE SHOULD REVERSE THAT AT SOME

46:25 POINT. SO FOR ME I DON'T THINK YOU'LL

46:28 SEE A BIG SALE FROM THE BACK END.

46:33 I DO THINK THIS HUGE DEMAND FOR BONDS AND I THINK THEY LOOK

46:38 ATTRACTIVE IN REAL TERMS. BUT AGAIN, THIS IS MORE OF THE

46:44 CARRY ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE I THINK WE WILL GO BACK TO WHERE

46:46 WE WERE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR. I THINK WE SEE SEVEN CUTS

46:50 UNLESS WE SEE DETERIORATION AND DATA.

46:52 WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DOTS, THE MEAN JUST MOVES A LITTLE BIT

46:58 HIGHER. THERE ARE OVERDUBS OUT THERE

47:00 CALLING FOR FOUR MORE CUTS. THEY SEEM TO BE TAKING A CUE

47:05 FROM THE DATA AND COALESCING AROUND THE CENTRAL.

47:11 >> HOW MUCH IS THIS PART OF THE BID BEHIND GOLD.

47:14 THE IDEA THAT THAT'S MORE OF A SAFE HAVEN AT THIS POINT THE

47:17 LONGER-TERM BONDS WHEN YOU'RE NOT SURE ABOUT WHAT CAN BRING

47:20 INFLATION BACK DOWN TO 2%. AND PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR SOME

47:25 SORT OF BALLAST AT A TIME WHEN INFLATION IS STILL A RISK. IAIN:

47:29 THERE'S A FEW REASONS WHY GOLD IS DOING WELL.

47:34 THERE ARE PEOPLE SAYING POLICIES CAN BE EASING GOING TO

47:36 REAL ASSETS. I DON'T THINK IT'S SHOWING YOU

47:44 PEOPLE ARE PARTICULARLY CONCERNED AROUND GOLD HAS OFTEN

47:48 BEEN SEEN AS THAT SAFE HAVEN ASSET BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE

47:49 REST OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITIONS IN THE STOCK MARKET,

47:53 WILL I DON'T THINK GOLD IS REALLY SHOWN THAT.

47:55 I THINK IT'S MORE INFLATION. JONATHAN:

48:00 I'M NOT SURE WHAT SIGNAL I SHOULD TAKE FROM THE FACT YOU

48:01 ARE HERE AND NOT THERE. IAIN:

48:07 THE MOST INTERESTING THING FOR ME WILL BE WHETHER WE GET SOME

48:10 OF THOSE MOVES DOWN. BOTH SAYING THE MARKET WILL

48:18 TAKE THAT AS A DOVISH TILT. WE GET THE EXPECTATIONS OF WAGE

48:21 DATA AT THE SAME TIME. THE MOVEMENT IN THE U.K.

48:29 IS ALSO QUITE SUPPORTIVE THIS YEAR MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT

48:32 WE ARE SEEING OVER HERE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THE BANK

48:34 OF ENGLAND IS READING THAT. JONATHAN:

48:35 I APPRECIATE THE DISSENT. I AGREE WITH MIKE WHEN HE TALKS

48:38 ABOUT THIS. LISA:

48:45 I APPRECIATE IAIN STEELE HE HAD A CONSTRUCTIVE WAY OF SAYING --

48:48 ANSWERING WHAT YOU SAID WHAT'S THE TAKE THAT YOU ARE HERE AND

48:54 NOT THERE. JONATHAN:

48:56 THIS WAS GREAT, RATE TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

49:48 >> I THINK THIS IS A SIGNAL IN THE MARKET IS TAKING IT AS THAT

49:52 THAT THEY WILL TOLERATE SLIGHTLY HIGHER INFLATION FOR

49:56 LONGER.

49:56 >> THEY HAVE TO TOLERATE HIGHER IN THE NEAR TERM BUT THEY HAD

49:59 -- I DON'T THINK THEY ARE GIVING UP ON THAT GOAL.

50:08 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE.

50:22 WAS BY EVERYTHING, LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY THIS MORNING,

50:25 GOOD MORNING FOR OUR AUDIENCE WORLDWIDE THIS IS BLOOMBERG

50:27 SURVEILLANCE, OF THE SECOND HOUR BEGINS RIGHT NOW.

50:31 POSITED BY ONE THIRD OF 1%. REPORTED A FEW TIMES ON THE

50:33 PROGRAM.

50:34 IAN STEELY J.P. MORGAN, THIS CHAIRMAN WANTS TO

50:39 CUT RATES. LISA: THAT'S THE CAVEAT WE LEARNED

50:43 YESTERDAY. PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT'S OFF TO

50:45 THE RACES. ON THE ONE HAND YOU SEE

50:50 STRENGTH AND THEY WANT TO HAVE THE MONETARY CONDITIONS, WHAT'S

50:52 THE HOLDUP? JONATHAN: I WANT TO GO ALL BOY BACK

50:55 SEVERAL MONTHS.

50:57 WE BOTH ARE LOOKING AT EACH OTHER LIKE WHAT SHE'S TALKING

51:03 ABOUT. AFTER WHAT I HEARD YESTERDAY,

51:06 THE FED PUTS BACK. HE SAID REPEATEDLY AND HE

51:11 TALKED ABOUT IN JANUARY, THAT'S IMPLICIT.

51:15 IN BOTH THE FORECASTED NEWS CONFERENCE YESTERDAY.

51:19 THEY ARE TELLING YOU OF GROWTH WEEKENDS WE ARE READY TO GO.

51:22 REGARDLESS OF WHETHER INFLATION IS. LISA:

51:26 I WANT TO ISSUE A MEA CULPA.

51:29 I TURN TO YOU AND SAID THIS IS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT REGIME,

51:32 INFLATION IS FOCUSED. YOU WERE CORRECT AND I WAS

51:35 VASTLY WRONG. TO ME THIS HAS BEEN A BIG

51:39 SURPRISE.

51:45 EVERYONE WAS EXPECTING ALL THAT PAIN WE HEARD FROM FED CHAIR

51:46 JAY POWELL WILL COME INTO THE MARKET.

51:49 IT NEVER HAS AND THEY ARE DONE. JONATHAN:

51:54 THAT VOELKER IMPRESSION, THAT EIGHT MINUTE ADDRESS.

51:58 HERE WE ARE A FEW YEARS LATER. I REMEMBER A NUMBER OF YEARS

52:02 AGO WITH THE OBJECTIVE TO EXTEND THE CYCLE.

52:04 THAT'S WHAT I HEARD YESTERDAY EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T ACTUALLY

52:06 HEAR HIM SAY IT. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO EXTEND THE

52:09 CYCLE. HE DOES NOT WANT A RECESSION.

52:13 LISA: I KEEP GOING BACK TO THIS NOTE

52:20 ON BLACKROCK WHERE RICK WAS TALKING ABOUT ALONG WITH THE

52:21 INFLATIONARY PRESSURES ARE NOT IN CONTROL OF THE FED.

52:25 THE FED IS CONCERNED ABOUT SENTIMENT AND CONCERN ABOUT

52:27 THINGS GETTING OUT OF THEIR CONTROL AT A TIME WHERE YOU

52:32 LOOK AT SERVICE INFLATION, INSURANCE, MEDICAL COST, NONE

52:34 OF THIS STEMS FROM INTEREST RATE POLICY.

52:38 WHAT IS GOING TO CONTROL THOSE THINGS? IS IT JUST SUPPLY-SIDE

52:43 RESPONSES AND THE FED SAYING WE ARE DONE BECAUSE THOSE ARE OUT

52:47 OF OUR CONTROL. JONATHAN: CONCERNS FROM HOLDING TOO LONG

52:50 SEEM TO BE TRUMPING CONCERNS OF CUTTING TOO SOON.

52:54 GREENLIGHTED THE NEWS CONFERENCE , THAT'S WHAT

52:56 HAPPENED YESTERDAY. WE ARE POSITIVE BY ONE THIRD OF

52:59 1% ON THE S&P 500. IT'S NOT JUST STOCKS.

53:04 DOWN FOR BASIS POINTS ON THE 10 YEAR. DOWN.

53:12 MONDAY NORTH OF 470. AT THE FRONT END OF THE CURVE.

53:16 HERE WE ARE ON THURSDAY SOUTH OF 460. BIG TURNAROUND. LISA:

53:21 70% CHANCE OF A FED RATE CUT IN JUNE BECAUSE THE DATA WILL NOT

53:27 COOPERATE ENOUGH TO GO AHEAD. JONATHAN:

53:29 WE WILL TRY TO CHALLENGE THAT CONSENSUS WITH RICHARD

53:35 BERNSTEIN AND WHY HE THINKS THE FED MAY GO THE WHOLE YEAR

53:39 WITHOUT CUTTING GRADE BIDEN DOUBLES DOWN IN AMERICA FIRST

53:45 AND KALLUM PICKERING AHEAD OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND RATE

53:50 DECISION.

53:51 CHAIR POWELL STAYS THE COURSE BOOSTING BETS THE FED WILL CUT

53:52 RATES IN JUNE. RICHARD NOT EXPECTING ANY

53:57 REDUCTIONS THIS YEAR EVEN SUGGESTING THERE'S A CHANCE OF

53:59 A HIKE. RICHARD I'M PLEASED TO SAY IS

54:02 WITH US AROUND THE TABLE. LET'S START WITH THAT PRESS

54:06 CONFERENCE BRAIDWOOD YOU MAKE OF THAT YESTERDAY? RICHARD:

54:11 I HAVE THE VIEW OF VIEWING HIM AS A BARTENDER STILL POURING

54:12 DRINKS. WE HAVEN'T HEARD LAST CALL YET

54:18 AND AS YOU SAID THAT'S CAUSING SPECULATIVE ASSETS TO GO UP AND

54:21 THAT'S A NATURAL REACTION THAT SHOULD GO ON WHEN THE FED IS

54:26 GOING TO PROVIDE A LOT OF LIQUIDITY IN AN ALREADY LIQUID

54:35 ENVIRONMENT.

54:35 MY CONFUSION IS THAT THERE IS EVERYTHING IS GOING UP.

54:39 IT SEEMS TO ME WE SHOULD BE SEEING THE CYCLICAL PRO

54:42 INFLATION SIDE DOING MUCH BETTER AND I'M NOT SURE THAT'S

54:46 HAPPENING GRADE I THINK THERE'S A SLIVER IN WHICH A SPECULATIVE

54:49 FURTHER IN THE MARKET, ANYTHING LIKE THAT I THINK THAT'S KIND

54:52 OF THE WARNING SIGN OUT THERE. THE MORE ECONOMICALLY SENSITIVE

54:55 STUFF SHOULD BE THERE.

54:59 LISA: FABULOUS FIVE YOU WANTED TO GET

55:06 APPLE AND TESLA.

55:08 I'M CURIOUS ABOUT WHY THAT SPECULATIVE IF THE EARNINGS ARE

55:12 THERE AND THAT'S THE JUSTIFICATION THAT EVERYONE

55:16 COMES ON THE SHOW GIVES. RICHARD:

55:18 THERE'S ALWAYS THIS NOTION WE HAVE TO WORRY SOME OF THESE ARE

55:21 BAD COMPANIES. THEY ARE NOT BAD COMPANIES.

55:23 THE QUESTION IS ARE THE UNIQUE COMPANIES.

55:24 I DON'T THINK THEY ARE.

55:30 JUST FOR THE S&P 500 WE HAVE 150 COMPANIES GROWING 25% OR

55:32 MORE. ONLY THREE OF THE MAGNIFICENT

55:36 SEVEN PASS THAT SCREEN. SO THERE IS CLEARLY A LOT OF

55:39 CHOICE OUT THERE. WHY WOULD ANYONE FOCUS ON THE

55:42 MAGNIFICENT SEVEN.

55:48 HISTORY SAYS YOU START GETTING THIS BROADENING THAT THE MARKET

55:52 STARTS BROADENING, THAT'S HAPPENING IN FITS AND STARTS.

55:55 LISA: THE THEORY WE HEAR IS OF THE

55:58 FEDERAL CUT RATES THAT WOULD ALLOW THE BROADENING OUT, IT

56:03 WOULD ALLOW SOME OF THE OTHER 490 FIVE STOCKS TO REALLY GAIN

56:06 SOME MOMENTUM BECAUSE THOSE OF THE MOST AFFECTED BY HIGH

56:08 INTEREST RATES. WHY DO YOU DISAGREE? IAIN:

56:11 I DON'T DISAGREE. -- RICHARD: I DON'T DISAGREE.

56:18 WHY WOULD THE FED WANT TO SPUR SPECULATIVE ASSET TO THE STOCK

56:21 MARKET AND FINANCIAL MARKETS? BECAUSE ULTIMATELY BUBBLES WERE

56:28 VERY SPECULATIVE PERIODS OF THAT ARE INHERENTLY INFLATION.

56:38 THEY ARE INHERENTLY INFLATIONARY .

56:39 YOU ALLOCATE CAPITAL FOR THINGS YOU DON'T NEED AND YOU DON'T

56:42 ALLOCATE FOR THINGS YOU DON'T NEED.

56:45 ULTIMATELY YOU SPUR INFLATION. I DON'T THINK THE FED HAS

56:46 THOUGHT THAT ONE THROUGH. JONATHAN:

56:51 HOW DO YOU IDENTIFY THAT IN STOCKS AT THE MOMENT. RICHARD:

56:57 IF YOU LOOK AT JUST STOCKS, IF YOU LOOK TO MY GIVES AND SEVEN

57:00 EFFECT GROWING EARNINGS TO 5% OR MORE.

57:03 I WOULD ARGUE THAT'S EUPHORIA. THE PROFIT CYCLE WASN'T SLOWING

57:07 IN THE UNITED STATES. TODAY THE PROFIT CYCLE IS

57:10 ACCELERATING. I WAS IN THE STOCK MARKET.

57:17 LISA: WHEN YOU TALK BUT HOW THEY ARE

57:21 FUELING A BUBBLE OR SPECULATIVE FERVOR, THERE IS A QUESTION OF

57:25 WHETHER THEIR POLICY MATTERS AT ALL WITH RESPECT TO INFLATION.

57:29 THIS IDEA AT SPURRING THE SPECULAR BUBBLE IS NOT FED

57:32 POLICY AT ALL. IT'S SOMETHING ELSE MAYBE

57:34 FISCAL AND THE FED IS TRYING TO RESPOND TO WHAT THEY CAN

57:37 CONTROL, A COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE, SOME OF THESE OTHER

57:40 ASPECTS. WHICH I FELT THE BITE OF IT.

57:42 RICHARD: THE KEYWORD THAT I THINK IS

57:45 IMPORTANT IS THE WORD RESPOND. A LOT OF INVESTORS BELIEVE THE

57:51 FED IS A LEADING INDICATOR, THE FED IS A LAGGING INDICATOR.

57:55 MAYBE WITH THE VOELKER FED BUT EVERY FED HAS BEEN A LAGGING

58:00 INDICATOR. THEY LOOK AT INFLATION LAGGING

58:02 INDICATORS AND THEY RESPOND TO LAGGING INDICATORS.

58:06 THAT'S THE THING I'M I THINK PRESENT THE OPPORTUNITY RIGHT

58:09 NOW IS THAT YOU'VE GOT LEADING INDICATORS THAT THEY'RE

58:11 STARTING TO GET STRONGER. WE SAW BUILDING PERMITS THE

58:13 OTHER DAY. BUT THE FED IS STILL REACTING

58:18 TO THE LAGGING INDICATORS. I THINK THAT PRESENTS A

58:22 TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE IT SAYS WE ARE LIKELY TO HAVE

58:26 MORE RATHER THAN LESS AND THE FED IS GOING, THAT'S TO ME SAYS

58:32 YOU WILL SEE MORE GROWTH AND CALLS FOR CYCLICALS. JONATHAN:

58:36 THIS IS JUST A TACTICAL CALL. THIS IS A LONG-TERM CALL,

58:40 CHANGE OF REGIME. CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT. RICHARD:

58:47 YOU GOT THE SECOND BACKDROP OF GLOBALIZATION CONTRACT.

58:51 I THINK THAT'S THE LONG-TERM, I KNOW ABOUT AI.

58:56 I THINK CONTRACTING GLOBALIZATION BECAUSE THE

59:00 UNITED STATES IS IN THE UNFORTUNATE POSITION OF A

59:02 MASSIVE TRADE DEFICIT IS GLOBALIZATION CONTRACT.

59:04 THAT'S A REALLY BAD COMBINATION. IT MEANS THE UNITED STATES WILL

59:09 HAVE TO REBUILD CAPITAL STOCK. PEOPLE CALL THIS RE-SHORING,

59:13 NEAR SHORING. THERE ARE SO MANY WORDS FOR

59:15 THIS. IT'S ALL THE SAME THEME. WE'VE REBUILD THE UNITED STATES

59:20 CAPITAL STOCK. JONATHAN: WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL WORK

59:26 THIS TIME BUT DIDN'T WORK LAST TIME IN THE PREVIOUS DECADE.

59:29 RICHARD: I THINK SMALL-CAP STOCKS.

59:33 THE AREA I THINK PEOPLE ARE PAYING ANY ATTENTION TO ON

59:36 SMALL AND MID-CAP INDUSTRIAL STOCKS.

59:39 THEY'VE OUTPERFORMED THE S&P 500 OVER THE LAST DECADE.

59:43 SMALL MID-CAP INDUSTRIALS HAVE WHICH I THINK IS THE BEGINNING

59:48 SIGN OF THIS D GLOBALIZATION REBUILDING THE STOCK.

59:53 >> DO PUSH BACK AGAINST THOSE WHO SAY THEY ARE BETTER

59:57 EQUIPPED TO ACTUALLY HANDLE THE VOLATILITY IN INFLATION IN THE

01:00:00 GLOBAL BACKDROP. RICHARD: I FIND THE LOVE OF LARGE

01:00:02 COMPANIES INTERESTING.

01:00:04 WHEN I STARTED MY CAREER, SENIOR ANALYST BALTIMORE

01:00:09 COMPANIES. IN THE LATE 70'S AND EARLY 80'S

01:00:16 THERE WAS A MASSIVE SMALL-CAP RALLY AND SMALL CAPS WERE

01:00:19 CONSIDERED SEXY SO SENIOR ANALYST FOLLOWED SMALL-CAP

01:00:21 COMPANIES, OF THE BIG COMPANIES THAT WERE BORING WERE FOLLOWED

01:00:23 BY JUNIOR ANALYSTS.

01:00:29 AS YOU GO THROUGH THE 80'S AND INTO THE 90'S THE BANKING CYCLE

01:00:32 CERTS PICKING UP YOU FIND THAT STARCH SWITCHING.

01:00:35 SO MANY YOU HAVE EVERYONE LOVING LARGE CAPS SINK SMALL

01:00:37 CAPS AND NO PLACE TO BE. EVERY WEEK ON 180 DEGREES.

01:00:43 I THINK IT'S AN AMAZING THING TO SEE WHEN I THINK OF THE

01:00:45 OPPORTUNITIES, THE WAY DESCRIBED TO THEM ARE THEY

01:00:49 REALLY SEVEN GROWTH STORIES IN THE ENTIRE WORLD.

01:00:53 OF COURSE NOT, THERE HAS TO BE A LOT MORE.

01:00:55 THAT'S WHERE THE OPPORTUNITY IS. JONATHAN:

01:00:58 WHAT IF THERE'S ONLY SEVEN GROWTH STORIES PEOPLE CARE

01:01:02 ABOUT. MONEY'S GONE PASSIVE, THE WAY B

01:01:04 INVESTORS CHANGED IN THE WINNERS JUST KEEP ON WINNING.

01:01:07 HOW DO YOU CHANGE THAT. RICHARD: MY POINT IS EVERYTHING IN LIFE

01:01:16 IS CENTERED, EVERYTHING WE DO IS CENTERED ON VALUE.

01:01:19 IF I TRY TO SELL YOU A VOLKSWAGEN FOR A BENTLEY PRICE

01:01:20 YOU WOULD NOT BUY IT. WE ALL UNDERSTAND VALUE.

01:01:24 FOR SOME REASON THERE'S STOCKMARKET TIME WHERE PEOPLE

01:01:28 SAY IT DOES NOT MATTER. I THINK THIS RESULTS IN

01:01:31 ATREIDES OPPORTUNITY FOR VALUE GIVEN NOBODY CARES ABOUT IT

01:01:34 ANYMORE. JONATHAN: RICHARD THERE OF RP ADVISORS.

01:01:36 LOOKING AT STOCKS AT THE MOMENT. EVERY FUTURES POSITIVE,

01:01:40 SCHEDULE AN ON STORIES ELSEWHERE.

01:01:42 HERE'S YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF. YAHAIRA:

01:01:45 THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS EXPECTED TO KEEP RATES ON HOLD GIVING

01:01:50 MORE TIME FOR INFLATIONARY PRESSURES TO COOL BEFORE

01:01:54 CUTTING RATES, THE GOVERNOR OPEN THE DOOR FOR CUTS THIS

01:01:55 YEAR AT THE LAST MEETING. MAINTAINING A BIG TIMELINE WITH

01:02:01 INVESTORS BETTING THE FIRST CUT WILL ARRIVE IN AUGUST. THE

01:02:04 DECISION IS DUE AT 8:00 A.M. EASTERN. NEW ZEALAND'S ECONOMY

01:02:09 UNEXPECTEDLY CONTRACTED IN THE FINAL QUARTER OF 2023.

01:02:11 PUSHING THE COUNTRY INTO RECESSION.

01:02:15 THEY'VE BEEN EXPECTING 0.1 PERCENT BUT INSTEAD GDP FELL

01:02:17 FOR THE SECOND STRAIGHT QUARTER. HIGH INTEREST RATES HAVE

01:02:22 DAMPENED CONSUMER SPENDING AND INVESTMENT WITH THE RESERVE

01:02:27 BANK KEEPING RATES ON HOLD SINCE MAY AND LAST MONTH

01:02:31 SIGNALING THE INTENT TO LOWER RATES UNTIL 20 25 AMID RECORD

01:02:33 IMMIGRATION AND STUBBORN INFLATION.

01:02:40 A 4 BILLION DEAL SIGNED WITH AIRBUS TWO BY 33 WIDE-BODY JETS

01:02:43 AS IT LOOKS TO STREAMLINE ITS FLEET AHEAD OF THE MERGER.

01:02:48 SOUTH KOREA'S BIGGEST CARRIER PREFERRING THE AIRBUS MODEL TO

01:02:52 THAT OF BOWING WHICH HAD TYPICALLY BEEN THE CARRIER'S

01:02:53 TOP AIRCRAFT SUPPLIER. JONATHAN: UP NEXT ON THIS PROGRAM, BIDEN

01:03:00 DOUBLING DOWN ON AMERICA FIRST.

01:03:03 >> I WANT TO BUILD A FUTURE IN AMERICA.

01:03:07 MY PREDECESSOR ELECTED TO BUILD IN CHINA AND OTHER COUNTRIES.

01:03:10 JONATHAN: LIVE FROM NEW YORK, GOOD

01:03:21 MORNING. ♪

01:03:29 JONATHAN: STOCKS ON THE S&P RALLYING ONCE

01:03:32 AGAIN THIS MORNING. WELCOME TO THE SHOW.

01:03:38 EQUITY FUTURES UP ON THE S&P. UNDER SURVEILLANCE THIS

01:03:42 MORNING, BIDEN DOUBLING DOWN ON AMERICA FIRST. >> WE WILL

01:03:45 ENABLE>> ADVANCED MANUFACTURING HERE IN AMERICA AFTER YEARS.

01:03:52 I'M DETERMINED TO TURN THINGS AROUND AND INVEST IN AMERICA

01:03:55 AND ALL AMERICANS. THAT'S WHAT WE ARE DOING.

01:04:00 MY PREDECESSOR ONE OF THE FUTURE TO BE BUILT IN CHINA,

01:04:02 NOT AMERICA. JONATHAN:

01:04:09 PRESIDENT BIDEN VISITING A CAMPUS IN THE SWING STATE OF

01:04:14 ARIZONA AFTER AWARDING INTEL BILLIONS.

01:04:18 JENNIFER AT INVESCO JOINS US FOR MORE.

01:04:22 I WAS LISTENING TO THOSE COMMON -- COMMENTS.

01:04:23 IF YOU CHANGE PRESIDENT BIDEN AND PUT IN PRESIDENT TRUMP

01:04:27 DON'T THEY JUST SOUND LIKE EACH OTHER?

01:04:28 ISN'T THAT THE SAME LANGUAGE? JENNIFER:

01:04:35 THIS WAS A VERY BIPARTISAN BILL, THE CHIPS ACT WAS PASSED

01:04:37 IN 2022. WE SAW A LOT OF SUPPORT ON BOTH

01:04:44 SIDES FOR THIS MOVEMENT TO BRING ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TO

01:04:46 THE UNITED STATES. THIS WASN'T JUST SPURRED FROM

01:04:53 THE NEED FOR GLOBAL COMPETITION, BUT ALSO WE SAW

01:04:57 FROM THE PANDEMIC, THAT WAS VERY REAL.

01:05:04 AND WE SAW THE CONSTITUENTS OF THE SENATORS AND THESE

01:05:08 CONGRESSMEN ACROSS THE NATION AFFECTED BY THAT.

01:05:12 THAT'S THE MAIN REASON WHY.

01:05:15 >> THE PRESIDENT WAS IN ARIZONA. I WONDER HOW QUICKLY SEE THOSE

01:05:20 RESULTS FROM THESE KIND OF HANDOUTS FOR STATE MONEY, A

01:05:24 FEDERAL MONEY TO COMPANIES LIKE INTEL.

01:05:26 HOW QUICKLY DO YOU SEE THE BENEFITS OF THAT.

01:05:29 >> WE'VE SEEN MONEY BEING GIVEN TO INTEL.

01:05:32 THEY ANNOUNCED A BUYER TO THE CHIPS BUILT IN THE PAST THAT

01:05:35 THEY WOULD BE CREATING A FACILITY IN OHIO, BUT WE WILL

01:05:47 BE SEEING GRANTS AND LOANS IN THE NEXT SEVERAL WEEKS.

01:05:52 WE -- I THINK THIS WILL HAVE AN IMPACT IN THE MINDS OF THOSE

01:05:55 COMMUNITIES WHO WILL BE AFFECTED AND START TO SEE SOME

01:05:56 OF THOSE JOBS COME IN. THIS TAKES A LONG TIME TO

01:05:59 CREATE. THESE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES

01:06:04 COULD TAKE A YEAR, TWO YEARS AND NOT ONLY THAT WITH THE

01:06:05 WORKFORCE. IN THIS BILL, GRANTS TO DEVELOP

01:06:09 SOME OF THAT WORKFORCE AND EDUCATION WHERE THOSE

01:06:14 FACILITIES WILL BE LOCATED. LISA:

01:06:17 WHAT'S THE TIMEFRAME FOR THIS BILL AND THE MONEY IN IT BEING

01:06:18 DOLED OUT. PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT FISCAL

01:06:21 STIMULUS RUNNING OUT. IS IT, OR IS IT ONGOING?

01:06:32 JENNIFER: THAT'S CAN TAKE A LONG TIME TO

01:06:33 GET OUT. IT'S A LITTLE LATE.

01:06:39 . WE ARE STARTING TO GET THAT

01:06:46 MONEY OUT THE DOOR AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE EVEN LONGER FOR

01:06:49 THESE FACILITIES TO BE BUILT AND START RUNNING BUT IT WAS

01:06:53 ALREADY IN THE HEARINGS LEADING UP TO THE MARKUP OF THE BILL

01:06:57 OUT OF BOTH HOUSES IT WAS SORT OF BEING TOLD THIS WOULD

01:07:01 PROBABLY BE AN EIGHT TO 10 YEAR PROJECT. LISA: WHAT'S BEHIND IT.

01:07:07 WE HEARD FROM PAT THAT HE NEEDS MORE IN ORDER TO COMPETE WITH

01:07:11 SOME OF THE SEMICONDUCTOR GIANTS IN THE WORLD.

01:07:17 IS THERE ROOM ON THIS FRONT GIVEN SOME OF THE DEFICIT AND

01:07:20 THE INCREASE WE'VE SEEN BENCHMARK RATES?

01:07:26 JENNIFER: THE QUESTION WILL BE THE NEXT

01:07:27 ALLOCATION.

01:07:34 THE COMMERCE SECRETARY HAS ALREADY SIGNALED THAT,

01:07:37 TELEGRAPHING TO CONGRESS WILL LIKELY NEED MORE INVESTMENT

01:07:42 HERE.

01:07:43 IT'S NOT SO MUCH THE MONEY, IT IS THE DEDICATION FROM THE U.S.

01:07:49 GOVERNMENT TO THESE COMPANIES AND SHOW WHERE THERE -- WE ARE

01:07:53 SUPPORTIVE OF YOU. IT WILL TAKE SOME REGULATORY

01:08:01 INITIATIVES TO EASE SOME OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES TO EVEN

01:08:02 BUILD THESE FACILITIES. THERE IS A LOT THAT GOES INTO

01:08:06 THIS BEHIND-THE-SCENES. SOME OF THE RED TAPE.

01:08:10 IT'S IMPORTANT TO SHARE THAT SIGN OF SOLIDARITY. JONATHAN:

01:08:16 THE POLICY LOOKS SIMILAR, THE LANGUAGE SOUNDS THE SAME.

01:08:19 WHO'S CONNECTING WITH VOTERS BASE, WHOSE MESSAGES MORE

01:08:22 EFFECTIVE. EVEN THOUGH THOSE MESSAGES ARE

01:08:24 QUITE SIMILAR. JENNIFER:

01:08:31 THERE IS A POPULISM STREAK RUNNING THROUGH AMERICAN

01:08:33 POLITICS IN BOTH SIDES ARE TRYING TO LATCH ON TO IT.

01:08:38 I THINK AS IT RELATES TO INFRASTRUCTURE, YOU HAD THE

01:08:43 PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION TALKING ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE THROUGH

01:08:45 THE ENTIRE FIRST TERM AND IT FINALLY GOT DONE IN THE BIDEN

01:08:48 ADMINISTRATION FIRST TERM. THOSE WERE TALKS IN CONGRESS

01:08:57 THAT WERE HAPPENING VERY LONG TIME.

01:08:58 EVERY WEEK IT FELT LIKE IT WAS INFRASTRUCTURE WEEK.

01:09:01 SOME OF THESE ISSUES ARE BY NATURE BIPARTISAN.

01:09:06 AND I THINK WE WILL SEE THE PUSH AND PULL IF SOME OF THAT

01:09:10 POPULISM STREAK RUNNING THROUGH THIS ELECTION THIS YEAR.

01:09:13 JONATHAN: IT WAS BASICALLY EVERY WEEK WAS

01:09:14 INFRASTRUCTURE WEEK. IT FELT THAT WAY BECAUSE IT WAS.

01:09:20 LISA: EXACTLY. WE MENTIONED THAT FREQUENTLY.

01:09:24 JONATHAN: THAT LANGUAGE, I WANT TO BUILD

01:09:26 A FUTURE AMERICA. MY PREDECESSORS CAMILLA THE

01:09:31 FUTURE BE BUILT IN CHINA AND OTHER COUNTRIES.

01:09:35 BIDEN IS TRYING TO OUT TRUMP TRUMP HIMSELF GOING INTO

01:09:36 NOVEMBER. LISA: WHICH IS THE REASON WHY LOOK AT

01:09:40 WHAT BOTH OF THEM ARE GOING TO DO.

01:09:44 THAT TO ME IS A HUGE TAKE AWAY AT A TIME WHERE THIS IS HAVING

01:09:48 REAL IMPACT IN SPECIFIC STATES AND FOR COMPANIES. JONATHAN:

01:09:56 POLITICIANS, CEOS, INVESTORS UNDERSTAND THE NATIONAL

01:10:00 SECURITY RISK FOR SEMICONDUCTORS BUT THEY DON'T

01:10:01 SEEM TO UNDERSTAND THE U.S. NATIONAL SECURED A RISK OF

01:10:04 BEING DEPENDENT ON THE REST OF THE WORLD FOR VIRTUALLY

01:10:06 EVERYTHING. HOW BIG OF A CHANGE ARE YOU

01:10:08 EXPECTING TO SEE? RICHARD: THIS IS NOT A CHANGE THAT'S

01:10:12 GOING TO OCCUR BEFORE THE NEXT COMMERCIAL BREAK.

01:10:17 IT'S GOOD TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S A 20 YEAR STORY.

01:10:21 -- GOING TO BE A 20 YEAR STORY. THE REBUILDING OF THE AMERICAN

01:10:27 -- WE HAVE BEEN DEPENDENT ON THE REST OF THE WORLD AND THAT

01:10:31 IS FINE AS LONG AS GLOBALIZATION IS EXPANDING IT

01:10:33 DIDN'T MATTER WE HAD A TRADE DEFICIT. NOW IT'S RETRACTING.

01:10:38 THE U.S. ECONOMY IN A VERY PRECARIOUS

01:10:42 POSITION. AND I THINK WE HAVE TO COME TO

01:10:46 THE REALIZATION WE ARE LAST AMONG MAJOR ECONOMIES.

01:10:49 DESPITE EVERYTHING WERE TALKING ABOUT WE ARE LAST. WE ARE LAST

01:10:55 AMONG MAJOR ECONOMIES IN SHIPPING.

01:11:00 THESE ARE REAL ISSUES AS GLOBALIZATION CONTRACTS.

01:11:05 WHETHER IT'S TRUMP OR BIDEN, EITHER WAY I THINK THAT THEME

01:11:09 OF REBUILDING AMERICAN CAPITAL STOCK WILL BE THE THEME OF

01:11:14 INVESTING.

01:11:15 >> WHICH AREA LOOKS MOST RIGHT FOR OPPORTUNITY BASED ON THAT

01:11:18 GIVEN THE FACT WE'VE SEEN SOME STOPS AND STARTS.

01:11:22 WE TALKED ABOUT VEHICLES, THE IDEAS CENTRAL PLANNING DOESN'T

01:11:24 ALWAYS WORK THAT WELL. RICHARD: I THINK EVERYBODY KNOWS

01:11:29 CALIFORNIA HAS THE PROPOSITIONAL LAW THAT BY 2030,

01:11:34 2035 ALL VEHICLE SOLD IN CALIFORNIA HAVE TO BE ELECTRIC

01:11:40 VEHICLES.

01:11:41 THE REALITY IS THE ELECTRIC GRID CAN SUPPORT THAT.

01:11:45 SO IT'S A BETTER INVESTMENT TEAM TO INVEST AND LET YOUR

01:11:48 VEHICLE COMPANIES OR TO INVEST IN THE INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES WHO

01:11:51 WILL BUILD OUT CALIFORNIA'S ELECTRIC GRID.

01:11:53 WE ARE BETTING ON THE INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES BUILDING

01:11:56 THE ELECTRIC GRID. IF THE INFRASTRUCTURE YOU NEED

01:11:59 TO THINK ABOUT ELECTRIC VEHICLES.

01:12:01 WITHOUT THAT, WHO CARES. JONATHAN:

01:12:04 WHO IS CAN A PAY FOR THAT? RICHARD:

01:12:08 THAT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION. WE ARE SO DEBT LADEN, YOU PAY

01:12:12 FOR ALL THIS.

01:12:18 THIS WILL OF COURSE GET PEOPLE RILED UP.

01:12:22 JUERGEN HAVE TO RAISE TAXES, AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

01:12:23 REDIRECT SPENDING. IT'S GOOD TO BE A WHOLE

01:12:26 DIFFERENT STORY. DEMOCRATS WILL HAVE TO GIVE UP

01:12:32 ON THE NOTION OF LET'S SPEND FOR THE TWO-YEAR ELECTION CYCLE.

01:12:35 REPUBLICANS LEFT TO GIVE UP ON THE LAFFER CURVE BECAUSE IT'S

01:12:39 PROVED NOT TO WORK IN AN OPEN ECONOMY.

01:12:43 TAX MISSIVES HAVE SIMULATED

01:12:49 OTHER COUNTRIES, THINK OF APPLE, THEY GET CORPORATE TAX

01:12:50 CUTS AND BUILD PLANTS IN CHINA.

01:12:56 I THINK YOU WILL HAVE TO SEE A COMPLETE REORIENTATION OF BOTH

01:12:57 PARTIES ECONOMIC POLICIES. JONATHAN:

01:13:02 ONLY GOT 60 SECONDS LEFT. RICHARD, PLENTY OF WORK AND HOW

01:13:07 QUICKLY WILL SEAL HIS POLITICAL CHANGES.

01:13:10 HOW QUICKLY IS THAT CAN HAPPEN? LISA:

01:13:16 WILL YOU GET THAT TO HAPPEN GIVEN EVERY ELECTION CYCLE IS A

01:13:19 RACE TO THE BOTTOM IN TERMS OF WHO CAN CUT TAXES AND GIVE OUT

01:13:22 MORE INCENTIVES TO PEOPLE. JONATHAN:

01:13:25 RICHARD THIS WAS GREAT. EQUITIES NOW UP.

01:13:32 COMING UP NEXT, SEBASTIAN PAGE OF T.

01:13:37 ROWE PRICE ON THE FOAM OF, THAT IS NOT MY QUOTE. HE OWNS IT.

01:13:41 WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT NEXT.

01:14:07 >> EUPHORIC. SERIOUSLY.

01:14:15 >> THERE'S A GYM. ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT IT?

01:14:22 JONATHAN FERRO WILL GO ON THE CREWS.

01:14:25 YOU SAID YOU WERE CONSIDERING IT.

01:14:26 >> NOT.

01:14:29 >> YOU SAID CONSIDERING IT.

01:14:32 >> I CANNOT COME UP WITH A NUMBER.

01:14:38 THEY CAN WORK ON THAT ONE.

01:14:46 EQUITIES ON THE S&P POSITIVE FIVE THIRDS OF A PERCENT.

01:14:51 PEOPLE WILL CLIP THAT.

01:14:57 >> THEY WILL CUT OFF THE FIRST PART.

01:15:01 >> IF I EVER SPEAK FAVORABLY ABOUT CRUISES YOU KNOW SOMEONE

01:15:02 HAS PAID ME. THREE BASIS POINTS ON THE

01:15:06 TWO-YEAR. THE RALLY CONTINUES.

01:15:12 DOWN FOUR BASIS POINTS ON THE TENURE.

01:15:15 SURPRISE RATE CUT FROM THE SWISS.

01:15:21 THE SWISS NATIONAL BANK DOWN 25 BASIS POINTS, FEELING A WEAKER

01:15:23 SWISS FRANC. THAT'S THE FIRST ONE.

01:15:32 BANK OF 30 MINUTES -- OF ENGLAND IN 30 MINUTES.

01:15:36 >> THIS IS THE FIRST RATE CUT. THERE'S A RACE TO CUT.

01:15:41 YOU GET THE SENSE THAT IT'S BENEFICIAL TO BE ON THE FRONT

01:15:42 END OF THAT. THE SWISS NATIONAL BANK WAS

01:15:46 CONCERNED ABOUT THE CURRENCY THAT'S TOO STRONG.

01:15:51 >> YOU CAN STILL MAKE A GOOD LIVING.

01:15:55 AND BE SEEN WITH THE SWISS NATIONAL BANK PRESIDENT EARNS?

01:15:58 UPWARDS OF ONE MILLION SWISS. I THINK THE GOVERNORS GET A

01:16:02 COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND. GRANTED YOU GET MONEY IN THE

01:16:09 PRIVATE SECTOR NECTAR THAT. ECB, DIFFERENT PAY STRUCTURE.

01:16:18 YOU GET MORE AS THE NATURAL -- NATIONAL CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR

01:16:20 OF ITALY RATHER THAN ECB PRESIDENT.

01:16:22 >> ARE YOU THINKING OF THAT?

01:16:27 >> TO SERVE AS A BANK PRESIDENT? I'M THINKING ABOUT GOING ON A

01:16:33 CREWS. 880,000 SWISS FRANCS.

01:16:38 >> YOU'RE GOING TO RUN THE SWISS NATIONAL BANK.

01:16:41 >> I DON'T THINK ANYONE WANTS ME RUNNING THAT.

01:16:45 I DON'T THINK THEY WANT ME RUNNING ANYTHING.

01:16:48 THE FED KEEPING RATES ON HOLD FOR A FIFTH STRAIGHT MEETING,

01:16:54 STARING DOWN A FIFTH STRAIGHT

01:17:01 WEEK OF HARDER THAN EXPECTED -- HOTTER THAN EXPECTED INFLATION

01:17:02 PRINTS.

01:17:05 >> THE INFLATION DATA CAME IN HIGHER.

01:17:06 THAT'S A SEPARATE MATTER. THE CAUSED PEOPLE TO WRITE UP

01:17:10 THEIR INFLATION. WE CONTINUE TO HAVE BEEN GOOD

01:17:13 PROGRESS.

01:17:18 >> INFLATION CAME UP AS A SEPARATE MATTER DISTINCT ALMOST

01:17:23 DIVORCED FROM GROWTH BEING BETTER-THAN-EXPECTED.

01:17:26 IT'S THAT MESSAGE WE KEEP HEARING FROM THIS FED CHAIR.

01:17:31 >> WHICH SPEAKS TO THIS POINT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS

01:17:37 MORNING, WHICH IS IS THE INFLATION WE ARE SEEING EVEN

01:17:39 UNDER THE PURVIEW OF THE FED? TO INTEREST RATES MATTER?

01:17:47 IF SO, WHAT IS THEIR COMPASS FOR MOVING AWAY FROM

01:17:51 RESTRICTIVE RATES?

01:17:53 >> NO MOVES FROM THE FED.

01:18:02 WE HAD A MOVE FROM THE BANK OF JAPAN.

01:18:08 THE GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF JAPAN MORNING WAITING TO HIKE

01:18:13 WOULD RAISE UPSIDE INFLATION RISKS, SAYING THE POSSIBILITY

01:18:18 WOULD HAVE STRENGTHENED FOR A RAPID AND LARGE-SCALE RATE

01:18:20 HIKES AFTER THE END OF LARGE-SCALE USING.

01:18:23 WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?

01:18:26 >> OPERATION TRY TO STRENGTHEN THE YEN.

01:18:29 TRYING TO SAY THIS IS NOT THE MOST OF US THING

01:18:35 -- THIS IS NOT THE MOST DOVISH THING EVER.

01:18:41 THERE WAS OTHER RHETORIC OUT OF THE ETHER ABOUT FURTHER RATE

01:18:44 HIKES. THIS IS WHAT WE EXPECTED. WE SAW THE YEN WEAKEN.

01:18:59 IF THAT WAS THE OBJECTIVE, CAN WE JUDGE HOW SUCCESSFUL THEY

01:19:00 HAVE BEEN?

01:19:03 >> THE SUCCESS FOR THEM IS THAT JAY POWELL IS DOVISH.

01:19:07 THAT GAVE THEM AN OUT TO CONTINUED WITH A MUDDIED BUT

01:19:12 OTHERWISE DOVISH MESSAGE AND NOT SEE A MASSIVE DEVALUATION

01:19:14 WITH RESPECT TO THE YEN.

01:19:16 >> WELL FRAMED. BECAUSE THE DOLLAR GOING INTO

01:19:20 THAT CONFERENCE WAS STRONG.

01:19:26 APPLE SLIGHTLY LOWER WITH THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT POISED TO

01:19:30 ANNOUNCE A LAWSUIT ACCUSING IT OF BREAKING ANTITRUST LAWS BY

01:19:33 BLOCKING COMPETITORS FROM ACCESSING FEATURES OF ITS

01:19:34 IPHONE. THE DOJ ALREADY SUING GOOGLE

01:19:40 AND FTC PURSUING CASES AGAINST META AND AMAZON.

01:19:43 LET'S THROW UP YEAR TO DATE WHERE APPLE IS IN 2024.

01:19:48 NEVER MIND THE MAC SEVEN. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MAG ONE.

01:19:55 APPLE IS DOWN 7% YEAR TO DATE AND IT'S GOT ALMOST NOTHING TO

01:20:04 DO WITH THIS.

01:20:05 WHERE WILL GROWTH COME FROM THIS YEAR TO FUEL THE UPGRADE

01:20:10 CYCLE?

01:20:11 >> THIS ANTITRUST SUITS BEEN GOING OUT SINCE 2017.

01:20:16 ON EVERY SIDE THEY ARE GETTING CHALLENGED.

01:20:20 EVERYTHING WE SAW WITH RESPECT TO PARTNERING WITH GEMINI, WITH

01:20:25 GOOGLE, IS THEY ARE COMING OUT WITH A SMART PHONE THAT USES

01:20:28 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEED TO GET AHEAD OF THAT AFTER

01:20:32 THE FAILED VENTURE INTO THE CAR. THIS WILL BE A FASCINATING

01:20:35 DEVELOPMENT FOR ONE OF THE WORLD'S BIGGEST COMPANIES.

01:20:40 >> APPLE A LITTLE BIT SOFTER, DOWN ABOUT 1%.

01:20:46 A QUOTE FROM OUR NEXT GUEST. SEBASTIAN PAGE OF T. ROWE PRICE.

01:20:52 DO YOU HAVE FOMO ON MOMO BECAUSE YOLO?

01:20:59 I'M NOT TRYING TO TELL YOU TO LOAD UP ON ASSETS LIKE THAT BUT

01:21:06 A FULLY INVESTED AND BALANCED APPROACH WITH DISCIPLINE

01:21:08 REBALANCING WITH THE TILT TOWARD VALUE SEEMS WARRANTED.

01:21:11 WHAT WAS THAT? DO YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN.

01:21:17 >> I WROTE THAT JUST FOR YOU BECAUSE I KNOW YOU LIKE

01:21:21 ACRONYMS. MY UPDATE REVEALED I SPENT LAST WEEK ON A CREWS WITH

01:21:22 MY FAMILY.

01:21:24 >> WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT. YOU SAID YOU WERE

01:21:27 ENTHUSIASTICALLY NEUTRAL. DOES THAT STILL YOUR APPROACH

01:21:29 TO MARKETS NOW?

01:21:32 >> WE ARE STILL NEUTRAL. THE MOMENTUM SITUATION IS

01:21:36 INTERESTING. WE JUST CONCLUDED A STUDY OF

01:21:38 MOMENTUM. IF YOU NAIVELY BY THE

01:21:44 TOP-PERFORMING STOCKS EVERY MONTH AND LOOK AT THE

01:21:47 PERFORMANCE OF THAT KIND OF STRATEGY, IT'S AT AN ALL-TIME

01:21:48 HIGH. SO MOMENTUM, BASED ON THE DATA

01:21:54 I HAVE, WHICH GOES BACK TO THE 1990'S AND FURTHER, IT HAS

01:21:57 NEVER WORKED THIS WELL. THIS IS WORRISOME.

01:22:04 BUT THE CONCLUSION OF OUR ANALYSIS IS THAT WHEN MOMENTUM

01:22:05 SPIKES LIKE THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A BAD THING FOR

01:22:06 MARKET. THAT'S COUNTERINTUITIVE BUT

01:22:10 WHAT WE ARE FINDING.

01:22:12 >> SO STICK WITH IT IS THE MESSAGE.

01:22:14 >> IT'S NOT A SYSTEMIC RISK. THE WINNERS THEMSELVES WHEN

01:22:20 MOMENTUM IS HIGH CAN CONTINUE TO DO WELL.

01:22:24 THE BIG MAYOR MARKETS -- THE BIG BEAR MARKETS WE HAD,

01:22:30 ESPECIALLY THE LAST THREE, OCCURRED WHEN MOMENTUM WAS

01:22:31 REALLY LOW GOING INTO IT. THE PERFORMANCE OF THAT NAIVE

01:22:34 TREND FOLLOWING. SO I WAS SURPRISED BY THAT.

01:22:41 IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THE TIMES WHEN MOMENTUM WAS IN THE TOP

01:22:47 QUINTILE, THE AVERAGE RETURN FOR STOCKS SYSTEMICALLY IS 14%.

01:22:51 THE AVERAGE RETURN FOR THE HIGH MOMENTUM STOCKS IS ALSO SOLID.

01:22:53 HERE'S THE CAVEAT. THERE'S A FAT TAIL.

01:22:57 THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED IN 2000. MOMENTUM WAS SUPERHIGH AND YOU

01:23:02 HAD THE MOTHER OF ALL MOMENTUM CRASHES.

01:23:04 SO YOU HAVE TO MANAGE THE RISK.

01:23:08 >> DO YOU HAVE A FEAR OF MISSING OUT ON MOMENTUM BECAUSE

01:23:14 YOU ONLY DISHED DO NOT HAVE A FEAR OF MISSING OUT ON MOMENTUM

01:23:16 BECAUSE YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE.

01:23:19 WHY NOT JUST BE NEUTRAL -- WHY NOT JUST BE AGGRESSIVELY

01:23:24 OVERWEIGHT?

01:23:25 >> LOVE THAT QUESTION. [LAUGHTER]

01:23:31 [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER]

01:23:35 >> WE LOOKED AT THE MOMENTUM SPIKES HISTORICALLY AND STUDIED

01:23:37 THEM AND LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED AFTER.

01:23:40 THERE'S A DIFFERENCE ON WHETHER THE MENDHAM IS DRIVEN BY

01:23:45 MOMENTUM IN UNDERLYING FUNDAMENTALS OR WHETHER IT'S A

01:23:46 "JUNK RALLY." IF YOU LOOK AT THE QUALITY

01:23:52 FACTOR AND SEE IF A BEHAVES SIMILARLY TO THE MOMENTUM

01:23:57 FACTOR THEN YOU CAN BE REASSURED DON'T FEAR THE MOMO.

01:24:03 FUNDAMENTALS HAVE HAD REALLY GOOD MOMENTUM, SUSTAINING PRICE

01:24:08 MOMENTUM IN SOME OF THE LARGE CAPS, SO IT'S NOT A JUNK RALLY

01:24:10 SITUATION. THE BIG MOMENTS BLOWUP OF 2000,

01:24:16 NON-EARNERS WERE SPIKING AND QUALITY WAS NOT IN FAVOR.

01:24:19 THAT'S THE WARNING SIGN YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR.

01:24:24 GOING BACK TO THE LAST THREE BEAR MARKETS, MOMENTUM CAN

01:24:27 WEAKEN QUITE A BIT AND GO TO THE BOTTOM QUINTILE BEFORE A

01:24:30 MARKET CRASH. SO LOOK FOR WHEN IT GETS JUNK

01:24:32 YEAR. WHEN FUNDAMENTALS ARE NOT SUSTAINING IT ANYMORE.

01:24:41 IT CAN ACTUALLY SOFTEN BEFORE THE MARKET CRASH.

01:24:45 >> WHY WOULDN'T YOU SAY THIS IS NOT EUPHORIA?

01:24:47 WHY WOULDN'T YOU SAY THIS IS NOT A BUBBLE, NOT SPECULATIVE,

01:24:53 EXCESSIVE MOMO AND THE OTHER THINGS YOU SAID?

01:24:56 WHY NOT SAY THIS IS THE REALITY? BECAUSE IT'S SUPPORTED BY THE

01:25:00 FUNDAMENTALS, WHICH IS THE CASE SO MANY PEOPLE MAKE?

01:25:06 >> ANOTHER THING TO -- ANOTHER WAY TO LOOK AT THAT QUESTION IS

01:25:09 TO LOOK AT THE PRICE-EARNINGS RATIO OF THE HIGH MOMENTUM

01:25:13 STOCKS AND DIVIDE THAT BY THE RATIO OF THE MARKET.

01:25:16 NOW YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE RELATIVE VALUATION OF THE HIGH

01:25:19 MOMENTUM BASKET. IT IS ELEVATED BUT NOT CRAZY HI.

01:25:27 YOU ARE MILES AND MILES AWAY FROM PRIOR BUBBLES.

01:25:32 AGAIN, FUNDAMENTAL, SUSTAINING THE MOMENTUM.

01:25:34 I THINK WE ARE MAYBE A MILE FROM THE CLIFF, NOW THE METER

01:25:43 OR FOOT -- NOT A METER OR FOOT, SO THERE'S TIME TO SEE IF THIS

01:25:47 WILL UNFOLD AND CONTINUE TO BE SUSTAINED. THAT'S THE QUESTION.

01:25:51 >> THAT IS THE QUESTION I WANTED TO ASK YOU.

01:25:54 WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU ENTHUSIASTICALLY BULLISH?

01:25:58 YOU OFFERED THREE THINGS TO FOCUS ON, EARNINGS, CONSUMER,

01:26:00 AND MONEY. HOW ARE THINGS DEVELOPING?

01:26:05 >> THE BLOB OF MONEY IS STILL THERE.

01:26:07 LET'S START WITH THAT ONE. YOUR SHOW ON BANK OF AMERICA

01:26:10 WAS EXCELLENT. THEY HAVE 37 MILLION CONSUMERS.

01:26:16 THEY LOOK AT THE CHECKING ACCOUNTS.

01:26:19 THEY MENTION TO 40% HIGHER BALANCES OF ROSS INCOME --

01:26:25 HIGHER BALANCES ACROSS INCOME QUINTILES.

01:26:31 SO THE BLOB OF MONEY IS ALIVE AND WELL. EARNINGS ARE GOING UP.

01:26:36 AND THE DIRECTION OF FED POLICY IS DOWN.

01:26:40 VALUATIONS ARE ELEVATED. WE HAVE HAD A MASSIVE RALLY.

01:26:44 WHAT WOULD MAKE US MORE BULLISH? IT WOULD BE A MARKET PULLBACK

01:26:51 ALL ELSE BEING EQUAL, A SPIKE IN THE VIX.

01:27:00 SEEING THE VIX AT 25, 30 WOULD BE A MOMENT TO GET MORE

01:27:03 AGGRESSIVE, LEAN INTO RISK ASSETS AT CHEAPER PRICES.

01:27:06 >> DOES THE FED NOT MATTER?

01:27:08 >> THE FED MATTERS BECAUSE EVERYONE IS OBSESSED WITH THE

01:27:10 FED. BUT IN TERMS OF INFLATION,

01:27:16 WE'VE HAD A SUPPLY AFFECT THAT'S BEEN MAYBE EVEN MORE

01:27:17 IMPORTANT THAN THE FED. I THINK THE FED WILL ALSO

01:27:21 MATTER IF THEY GET MORE HAWKISH. MY VIEW IS THERE'S UPSIDE RISKS

01:27:24 TO INFLATION. OUR CEO ASKED ME TO HIS OFFICE

01:27:30 TO TALK ABOUT MY MARKET VIEWS. I SENT HIM AN EMAIL WITH ONE

01:27:33 CHART. I SAID I THINK THIS IS THE MOST

01:27:37 IMPORTANT CHARTING CAPITAL MARKETS.

01:27:41 IT'S A CHART OF THE ONE YEAR BREAKEVEN INFLATION IMPLIED BY

01:27:42 THE MARKETS. IT WAS 2% IN JANUARY.

01:27:46 IT'S AT 4.1% TODAY.

01:27:48 >> HOW MUCH OF THE MONEY WILL

01:27:51 GO INTO CRUISE LINE TICKETS THAT ARE FLOATING CITIES ON THE

01:27:55 OCEAN?

01:27:56 >> YOUR TURN FOR THE REVIEW.

01:28:00 >> I WILL GIVE YOU A ONE-WORD REVIEW. TOLERABLE.

01:28:06 >> RINGING ENDORSEMENT.

01:28:07 >> THE FAMILY LOVED IT. IT'S NOT AS CROWDED AS YOU

01:28:10 THINK.

01:28:11 >> BECAUSE IT IS SO BIG.

01:28:15 >> IT'S SO BIG AND EVERYBODY GOES TO THE SAME PLACE, THE

01:28:19 POOL, AND THEN YOU HAVE DIFFERENT PLACES TO GO TO HIDE.

01:28:21 YOU ALSO GO ON ISLANDS, WHICH IS FUN.

01:28:25 I TOOK MY SON ON A HIKE ON SAINT MAARTEN.

01:28:27 THAT WAS FANTASTIC.

01:28:30 >> SOUNDS LOVELY, THE ISLAND PIECE OF IT. WOULD YOU GO AGAIN?

01:28:33 >> NOT TOO OFTEN.

01:28:36 >> I THINK THAT'S A NO. TOLERATED IT.

01:28:40 >> IT IS FOR THE KIDS.

01:28:41 >> LIKE DISNEYLAND.

01:28:43 >> YOU TOLERATE IT.

01:28:45 >> YOU FEEL LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE TO ENTERTAIN THEM TOO MUCH.

01:28:49 >> YOU WOULD DO THE SAME THING?

01:28:51 >> I DON'T KNOW THAT I WOULD DO THE SAME THING.

01:28:54 >> THE TRUTH IS IT'S A DEMOCRACY IN MY FAMILY AND I

01:28:57 GOT ON VOTED TO GO ON THAT.

01:29:00 >> FANTASTIC TO SEE YOU. SEBASTIAN PAGE OF T. ROWE PRICE.

01:29:10 AN UPDATE ON STORIES ELSEWHERE. HERE IS YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF.

01:29:16 >> THE SWISS NATIONAL BANK CUT ITS KEY INTEREST RATE BY 25

01:29:20 BASIS POINTS MONTHS AHEAD OF THE FED AND ECB.

01:29:25 OFFICIALS LOWERING THEIR BENCHMARK RATE TO 1.5%.

01:29:29 SOME WERE BETTING ON A CUT BUT MOST ECONOMISTS PREDICTED THE

01:29:32 RATE WOULD STAY UNCHANGED UNTIL JUNE.

01:29:38 THE FRANC TUMBLING AFTER THE DECISION TO ITS WEAKEST LEVEL

01:29:40 AGAINST THE EURO SINCE JULY 2023.

01:29:43 READ IT WILL MAKE ITS STOCK MARKET DEBUT TODAY.

01:29:48 IT PRICED ITS IPO AT $34 A SHARE.

01:29:54 THE OFFERING VALUES THE COMPANY AT ALMOST $6.5 BILLION.

01:29:58 SHARES WILL TRADE UNDER THE TICKER RDDT.

01:30:03 BLOOMBERG TECHNOLOGY WILL HAVE AN INTERVIEW WITH THE CEO.

01:30:09 MICRON TECHNOLOGY IS SURGING IN THE PREMARKET AFTER IT GAVE A

01:30:12 SURPRISINGLY STRONG REVENUE FORECAST.

01:30:16 THE OUTLOOK UNDERSCORING SOARING DEMAND FOR THE HARDWARE

01:30:18 USED TO POWER ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.

01:30:22 THE LARGEST MAKER OF COMPUTER MEMORY CHIPS IN THE U.S.

01:30:24 SAYS THIRD QUARTER REVENUE WILL

01:30:30 BE UP TO $6.8 BILLION, TOPPING $6 MILLION EXPECTED BY ANALYSTS.

01:30:33 >> THANK YOU. THE FED IS KNOWN. THE BOE IS ON DECK.

01:30:39 >> THE PLAN TO BRING INFLATION DOWN IS WORKING.

01:30:43 WE NEED TO STICK TO IT AND SEE IT THROUGH.

01:30:48 AS INFLATION GETS CLOSER TO ITS TARGET, THAT OPENS THE DOOR FOR

01:30:52 THE BANK OF ENGLAND CONSIDER -- TO CONSIDER BRINGING DOWN

01:30:55 INTEREST RATES.

01:30:55 >> THAT DECISION 15 MINUTES AWAY.

01:31:26 >> OF 0.4% ON THE S&P -- UP 0.4% ON THE S&P.

01:31:33 THE FED IS DONE. THE BANK OF ENGLAND ON DECK.

01:31:39 >> WE ARE FIRMLY ON TRACK TO BRING INFLATION DOWN TO TARGET.

01:31:43 THIS IS THE LOWEST HEADLINE RATE FOR 2.5 YEARS.

01:31:47 THIS SHOWS THE PLAN TO BRING INFLATION DOWN IS WORKING.

01:31:51 WE NEED TO STICK TO IT AND SEE IT THROUGH.

01:31:58 AS INFLATION GETS CLOSER TO ITS TARGET, THAT OPENS THE DOOR FOR

01:32:01 THE BANK OF ENGLAND TO CONSIDER BRINGING DOWN RATES.

01:32:03 >> JUST ABOUT 10 MINUTES AWAY FROM THE RATE DECISION,

01:32:08 EXPECTED TO KEEP RATES ON HOLD AS U.K.

01:32:09 INFLATION FALLS TO THE LOWEST LEVEL SINCE 2021.

01:32:14 THERE'S A CHANCE POLICYMAKERS GIVE A NOD TO CURRENT MARKET

01:32:19 EXPECTATIONS FOR A CUT IN JUNE, WHICH THEY CAN SUBMIT INMATE.

01:32:23 CALLUM JOINS US. THERE WERE TWO POLICYMAKERS WHO

01:32:28 DID THIS LAST TIME. WHERE ARE THEY NOW?

01:32:39 >> IF WE WERE TO LOSE ONE, THAT WOULD BE A DOVISH SINGLE.

01:32:43 THE OTHER THING TO WORK OUT -- TO WATCH OUT FOR, WE ALREADY

01:32:48 HAVE ONE POLICYMAKER WANTING TO CUT, SO IF WE HAD TWO, THAT

01:32:54 WOULD BE A DOVISH SINGLE -- DOVISH SIGNAL.

01:32:59 THESE ARE THE KIND OF SIGNALS BEYOND THE FORWARD GUIDANCE OR

01:33:02 ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ECONOMIC FORECAST THAT THE BANK -- WHERE

01:33:09 THE MARKET SHOULD BE LOOKING.

01:33:13 >> OF THOSE DISSENTERS, WHO GOES INTO THAT MEETING GOING --

01:33:18 THAT MEETING FEELING MORE EMPOWERED?

01:33:22 >>

01:33:29 THE ONE WHO IS MOST HAWKISH WILL MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT WE

01:33:32 ARE NOT QUITE AT 2% AND THE ECONOMY SEEMS TO BE

01:33:38 STRENGTHENING. MONETARY POLICY. THAT WILL BE THE ARGUMENT.

01:33:42 I THINK WE WILL PROBABLY GET HOLDS AND CUTS FROM EVERYONE

01:33:47 ELSE.

01:33:48 THE GENERAL VIEW IS WE HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB.

01:33:51 THE MARKETS ARE A LITTLE UNHAPPY.

01:33:55 THERE IS SOME QUESTION AROUND CREDIBILITY.

01:33:58 BUT YOU LEAN BACK AND SAY WE HAD A MASSIVE SHOCK, INCREASED

01:34:02 INTEREST RATES BY MORE THAN FIVE BASIS POINTS, AND NOT MUCH

01:34:05 HAPPENED. WE HAD A STAGNATION.

01:34:12 WE DO NOT HAD -- NOT HAVE ANY RISE IN UNEMPLOYMENT.

01:34:16 THIS IS PRETTY MUCH A JOB WELL DONE SO LET'S TAKE A FOOT OFF

01:34:21 THE BRAKE. I THINK THE BANK OF ENGLAND

01:34:25 WILL BE EAGER TO VALIDATE MARKET EXPECTATIONS FOR A CUT

01:34:26 IN JUNE. SO WE WILL BE CONFIRMING WHAT

01:34:33 WE ALREADY KNOW, WHICH IS THE CENTRAL BANK THINKS IT'S DONE

01:34:34 ITS JOB.

01:34:40 >> HOW MUCH IS THE BANK OF ENGLAND GETTING SOME SIGNAL

01:34:44 FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE, HAVING A BIT OF A GREEN LIGHT

01:34:48 TO HAVE A DOVISH MESSAGE, BECAUSE THE FED TOOK THE PEDAL

01:34:49 OFF THE ACCELERATOR THERE?

01:34:51 >> THE FED IS THE MOST IMPORTANT CENTRAL BANK IN THE

01:34:55 WORLD. IT IS THE CONDUCTOR OF THE

01:34:58 GLOBAL ECONOMIC ORCHESTRA. WHAT THE FED SAYS MATTERS FOR

01:35:01 EVERYONE. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE BANK

01:35:07 OF ENGLAND AND THE ECB, I THINK MARKETS PUT TOO MUCH OF A FOCUS

01:35:09 AND EMPHASIS ON THIS IDEA THAT IT'S ABOUT FOLLOWING THE FED.

01:35:14 THE U.K. AND U.S. HAVE DIFFERENT ECONOMIC

01:35:15 DYNAMICS AT THE MOMENT. THE U.K. HAS HAD TWO YEARS OF STAGNATION.

01:35:22 WE HAD A MAJOR SUPPLY-SIDE SHOCK. THE MAKE OF ENGLAND HAS

01:35:27 AGGRESSIVELY RAISED RATES. NOW THE ECONOMY LOOKS LIKE IT'S

01:35:32 RECOVERING AT THE START OF THE YEAR AS INFLATION IS COMING

01:35:33 DOWN SO THEY WILL BE EAGER TO HELP THAT RECOVERING ALONG BY

01:35:36 TAKING ITS FOOT OFF THE BRAKE. THE FED IS LOOKING AT AN

01:35:45 ECONOMY WHICH FOR TWO YEARS HAS BEEN -- WHERE INFLATION MAY BE

01:35:48 TURNING STICKY AROUND 2.5%. THE FED'S ARGUMENT IS DO WE

01:35:52 NEED TO CUT? TO WHAT EXTENT SHOULD WE BE

01:35:57 HELPING THE ECONOMY, WHICH IS SHOWING NO TROUBLE YET

01:36:02 WHATSOEVER? WHEN YOU RATIONALIZE THE

01:36:05 ECONOMIES IN THESE WAYS, THERE'S A REASON WHY BOTH

01:36:08 CENTRAL BANKS WILL BE APPROACHING THEIR RELATIVE

01:36:09 INFLATION PROBLEMS IN A SIMILAR WAY.

01:36:11 IT JUST HAPPENS TO BE THAT IT WILL WIND UP WITH CUTS FROM

01:36:16 BOTH CENTRAL BANKS.

01:36:19 >> THERE'S A QUESTION OF DOES THE FED RATE POLICY AND THE

01:36:23 BANK OF ENGLAND POLICY REALLY AFFECT INFLATION OR HAVE A LOT

01:36:27 OF THE INFLATION FEATURES BEEN

01:36:33 FROM ELSEWHERE, SUPPLY-SIDE, DEMAND-SIDE, PANDEMIC RELATED

01:36:37 DISTORTIONS THAT ARE UNRELATED AND UNAFFECTED BY CENTRAL BANK

01:36:41 RATES?

01:36:42 >> IF WE ABSTRACTED FROM THE BIG SHOTS OF COVID, THE GAS

01:36:48 SHOCK, WE WOULD HAVE HAD CENTRAL BANKS GRADUALLY RAISING

01:36:51 RATES OVER THIS PERIOD. JUST TO REFLECT THAT WE SOLVED

01:36:58 A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS. NEUTRAL RATES HAVE GONE UP.

01:37:03 SO PART OF WHAT WE HAVE SEEN AS AN ACCELERATED PROCESS TOWARDS

01:37:04 NORMALIZATION.

01:37:10 WHAT INFLATION HAVE COME DOWN? I DON'T THINK IT WOULD HAVE.

01:37:15 WHAT WE WOULD HAVE SEEN IS A BIGGER REACTION IN WAGES AND

01:37:16 PRICE SETTING. THE SECOND ROUND EFFECTS WOULD

01:37:19 HAVE BEEN STRONGER. SO CENTRAL BANKS NEUTRALIZED

01:37:24 INTEREST RATES AND GOT INTO TIGHT TERRITORY.

01:37:28 THE EFFECT OF THAT HAS BEEN TO KEEP INFLATION EXPECTATIONS

01:37:33 UNDER CONTROL SO ONCE THE FIRST WAVE OF THIS SUPPLY SHOCK IS

01:37:36 FADED IT DOES NOT TURN INTO A DEMAND-SIDE INFLATIONARY

01:37:37 PROBLEM. THE CENTRAL BANK IS DOING A

01:37:41 FAIRLY GOOD JOB. JUST HOW MUCH UNEMPLOYMENT

01:37:47 WOULD WE HAVE HAD TO TOLERATE TO PREVENT WHAT'S BEEN THE

01:37:52 BIGGEST SUPPLY SHOCK FOR THE U.K. MORE THAN 40 YEARS?

01:37:59 I THINK IT'S A PREFERENTIAL OUTCOME TO DO THIS.

01:38:04 INTERNALLY, THE BANK OF ENGLAND WILL BE WITH THE SAME WAY.

01:38:10 >> THAT IS A CHAPTER WE ARE STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF WRITING.

01:38:13 CALLUM PICKERING.

01:38:17 >> PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR DISSENT.

01:38:18 THAT'S ONE OF THE UNIQUE FEATURES WE GET OF THE BANK OF

01:38:20 ENGLAND.

01:38:21 >> WE ENJOY THAT.

01:38:23 >> LOVE THAT. WE NEED TO DISSENT MORE.

01:38:27 >> WITH EACH OTHER.

01:38:28 >> I DON'T KNOW.

01:38:31 >> NEXT, GUESTS.

01:38:37 PLENTY OF DISSENT IN THE THIRD HOUR OF SURVEILLANCE.

01:38:58 >> OUR POLICY RATE IS LIKELY AT ITS PEAK.

01:39:01 IT WILL BE APPROPRIATE TO BEGIN DIALING BACK AT SOME POINT.

01:39:08 >> I THINK THIS IS A SIGNAL THAT THEY WILL TOLERATE HIGHER

01:39:09 INFLATION FOR LONGER.

01:39:12 >> I GUESS THEY HAVE TO TOLERATE HIGHER INFLATION IN

01:39:15 THE NEAR TERM BUT I DON'T THINK THEY ARE GIVING UP ON THAT GOAL.

01:39:19 >> THIS IS A FED THAT ONCE THAT SOFT LANDING.

01:39:21 >> I STILL THINK WE ARE GOING TO CUT RATES.

01:39:24 IT DEPENDS ON THE DATA.

01:39:28 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE WITH JONATHAN

01:39:32 FERRO, LISA ABRAMOWICZ AND ANNMARIE HORDERN.

01:39:33 >> GOOD MORNING. THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE.

01:39:38 THE THIRD HOUR. WRAPPING UP A WEEK OF CENTRAL

01:39:42 BANK DECISIONS.

01:39:48 THE SNB WITH A SURPRISING CUT, DROPPING 25 BASIS POINTS.

01:39:52 AT THE BANK OF ENGLAND, THAT DECISION CROSSING.

01:39:58 WE WERE LOOKING FOR TWO DISSENTERS WHO PREVIOUSLY HAD

01:40:00 THEIR HAND UP AND ASKED FOR HIKES. NO MORE.

01:40:06 >> WHAT WE SAW IS BOTH DROPPING THEIR VOTES FOR HIGHER RATES.

01:40:11 WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW GREAT IT IS FOR THE BANK OF ENGLAND

01:40:12 THAT THEY GET DISSENT. NO MORE.

01:40:18 EIGHT VOTED. NOBODY VOTED TO INCREASE THE

01:40:22 RATE. THIS IS A BANK OF ENGLAND THAT'S FACING OFF WITH CUTTING

01:40:25 RATES.

01:40:29 >> ALL ABOUT HOW THIS SETS UP THE NEXT MEETING.

01:40:33 WHEN YOU GET A PROJECTIONS, THAT MIGHT BE THE TIME THEY

01:40:34 REDUCE INTEREST RATES. IN THE SAME WAY, IT FEELS LIKE

01:40:38 THE JUNE MEETING MIGHT BE THE NEXT TIME.

01:40:41 THAT MIGHT BE THE MEETING THEY REDUCE RATES.

01:40:44 EITHER WAY, THEY ARE TAKING THE TIME.

01:40:47 >> EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE COALESCING.

01:40:51 WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THEIR PROJECTIONS, THEY EXPECT

01:40:54 INFLATION TO FALL BELOW 2%. WAGE GROWTH HAS MODERATED

01:41:00 ACROSS A NUMBER OF MEASURES. SO YOU HAVE A BANK OF ENGLAND

01:41:04 JUSTIFYING WHY THEY WOULD BE IN AN EASING POSTURE IN THE NEAR

01:41:05 FUTURE.

01:41:07 >> THE POUND WEAKER. IT WAS GOING INTO THIS -0.4% ON

01:41:12 CABLE. WE ARE PICKING UP WHERE WE LEFT

01:41:19 UP YES -- LEFT OFF YESTERDAY ON THE S&P.

01:41:22 HIGHER OFF THE BACK OF ALL-TIME HIGHS ON THE S&P 500.

01:41:27 WE HAD SOME WEIGHT TO THE CLOSE AND TO THE RALLY IN THE BOND

01:41:31 MARKET.

01:41:35 >> THE FED ESSENTIALLY, AND THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN

01:41:40 HEARING ALL MORNING, IS PRIORITIZING THE EXTENSION OF A

01:41:46 SOFT LANDING AND AN ECONOMIC CYCLE AT THE EXPENSE

01:41:48 POTENTIALLY OF BEING MORE AGGRESSIVE AND BRING DOWN

01:41:51 INFLATION SOONER. OUR PEOPLE THAN WORRIED ABOUT

01:41:54 INFLATION PICKING UP? THAT'S WHY WE ARE LOOKING AT

01:41:57 GOLD.

01:42:07 >> WE WANTED TO KNOW HOW THE DATA WOULD CHANGE THE

01:42:08 CONVERSATION ON THE FOMC.

01:42:14 IT DID NOT THERE LOOKING THROUGH HOTTER THAN EXPECTED

01:42:15 INFLATION PRINTS AND THINKING THE TREND IS INTACT AND MAYBE

01:42:19 WE ARE IN A POSITION TO REDUCE INTEREST RATES.

01:42:23 THIS FED WANTS TO CUT INTEREST RATES.I DON'T THINK YOU CAN

01:42:29 DRAW ANY OTHER CONCLUSION AFTER LISTENING TO CHAIR POWELL

01:42:30 YESTERDAY.

01:42:32 >> THIS IS NOT SET THEM BACK. IT DOES NOT SEEM LIKE THEY LOST

01:42:35 CONFIDENCE THAT THEY WERE NOT GOING TO CUT.

01:42:39 SOME OF THE LONGER-TERM QUESTIONS REMAIN.

01:42:43 WHERE THEY GO TO, THE TERMINAL RATE, HOW FAR CAN THEY CUT?

01:42:48 A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT SIMPLY NORMALIZING, NOT

01:42:50 EASING. WE WILL SPEND THE NEXT COUPLE

01:42:52 MONTHS PARSING THROUGH THAT. STAY TUNED.

01:42:54 >> THEY WILL BE GREAT. HERE IS THE LINEUP.

01:43:07 GARGI, STEPHANIE, BRIAN. STOCKS HITTING FRESH ALL-TIME

01:43:13 HIGHS FOLLOWING DOVISH NEWS. SMALL CAPS DELIVERING THEIR

01:43:20 BEST DAY IN ABOUT A MONTH. BLACKROCK'S GARGI CHOWDHURY

01:43:25 SAYING THIS.

01:43:43 GARGI, I'M PLEASED TO SAY, JOINS US.

01:43:46 IT'S IMPORTANT TO GO BACK. THIS MARKET WAS PRICED FOR SIX

01:43:50 OR SEVEN RATE CUTS. YOU SAID THAT WAS NONSENSE.

01:43:55 WE WOULD NOT SEE CUTS UNTIL THE SECOND HALF OF 2024.

01:43:58 WHAT WERE YOU LOOKING AT THAT HAS PLAYED OUT IN THE FASHION

01:44:00 YOU EXPECTED?

01:44:05 >> BACK WHEN WE WERE HERE IN DECEMBER AND TALKED ABOUT THE

01:44:10 FIVE OR SIX CUTS THAT WERE NONSENSE -- I DON'T THINK THAT

01:44:14 WAS USED -- BUT WE SAW THE MARKET HAD PRICED INTO MANY

01:44:18 RATE CUTS. REVIEW WAS INFLATION WILL

01:44:21 REMAIN STICKY -- THE VIEW WAS INFLATION WILL REMAIN STICKY.

01:44:23 IT'S STILL ABOUT 5%. WE HAVE SEEN INFLATION COMING

01:44:27 DOWN BUT NOT QUITE WHERE WE WOULD HAVE LIKED IT TO BE.

01:44:32 YESTERDAY, IT WAS INTERESTING

01:44:38 TO HEAR CHAIR POWELL SOUND SO CONFIDENT ABOUT THE

01:44:43 DECELERATION, TO YOUR POINT, HE DID SAY HE IS NOT GAINING

01:44:46 GREATER CONFIDENCE, BUT HE SEEMS TO BE SURE THIS IS JUST A

01:44:51 BUMP ALONG THE ROAD, AND FOR THE MOST PART HE'S FOCUSING ON

01:44:54 THE DECELERATION WE GOT IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2023, NOT SO

01:44:57 MUCH ON THE ACCELERATION IN THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF THE YEAR.

01:45:01 >> HE'S NOT LOST CONFIDENCE.

01:45:07 WHAT IS IN THE INFLATION NUMBER NOW THAT HE CAN TAKE CONFIDENCE

01:45:08 FROM?

01:45:11 >> A COUPLE OF THINGS I WAS LOOKING AT YESTERDAY IS FOR US

01:45:16 TO GET TO CORE PCE AT 2.6%. WE KIND OF KNOW WHAT THIS

01:45:22 MONTH'S DATA WILL BE GIVEN THE INPUTS ON CPI AND PPI.

01:45:28 THE REST OF THE YEAR, HE WOULD HAVE TO BE SURE THAT YOU ARE

01:45:32 GOING TO GET PCE AT .16 OR .17. I GUESS THAT IS ONE THING THEY

01:45:38 ARE RELYING ON, THAT EVEN IF INFLATION ON CPI REMAINS

01:45:43 STRONG, THAT IT'S PCE, WHICH HAS A LONG WAIT, SAVES THEM A

01:45:45 LITTLE BIT.

01:45:55 I ALSO THINK YOU FOCUSED ON NON-HOUSING SERVICES, THEY

01:45:57 EXPECT THAT TO DECELERATE. SO THERE CORE MEASURE IS STILL

01:46:02 AT .47. IMAGINING THEY EXPECT THAT TO

01:46:05 COME DOWN.

01:46:11 ONE POSITIVE THING I DID SEE IN THIS MONTH'S CPI PRINT WAS

01:46:15 UNLIKE JANUARY, EVERY SINGLE SERVICES SECTOR DID NOT

01:46:17 RE-ACCELERATE. WE DID SEE THAT IN THE JANUARY

01:46:20 PRINT, WHICH WAS SCARY TO ME. THIS TIME AROUND, THEY CAME

01:46:25 BACK TO TREND. THAT'S A POSITIVE SIGN.

01:46:32 FINALLY, GOOD SAID THAT ABERRATION FOR USED CARS.

01:46:36 THAT IS SOMETHING WE COULD SEE MODERATE.

01:46:40 >> I UNDERSTAND WHY THE FRONT END OF THE YIELD CURVE WOULD

01:46:45 RALLY.

01:46:46 I HAVE LESS OF A CLEAR SENSE OF WHY YOU ARE SEEING SUCH A RALLY

01:46:49 IN THE 10 YEAR WITH YIELDS NOW AT FOUR -- AT 4.2%.

01:46:56 YOU HAVE SEEN THIS COME IN AROUND 10 BASIS POINTS.

01:46:59 DOES THIS MAKE SENSE TO YOU IF THE FED IS SAYING THEY ARE OK

01:47:03 WITH INFLATION RUNNING HOTTER FOR LONGER?

01:47:06 >> DEFINITELY AGREE THAT THE FRONT END MAKES SENSE.

01:47:10 ON THE 10 YEAR, IT'S JUST RANGE BOUND.

01:47:17 WE HAVE SEEN THAT 4.31 LEVEL A FEW TIMES.

01:47:22 BETWEEN NOW AND THE NEXT IMPORTANT PRINT, IT WILL BE THE

01:47:23 NONFARM PAYROLL WE GET. I THINK WE TRADE IN A RANGE

01:47:26 BOUND FASHION. OVER THE LONGER OR MEDIUM

01:47:31 PERIOD OF TIME, CAN WE SEE YIELD CURVE STEEPEN? .

01:47:34 ABSOLUTELY. THAT BELLY OF THE CURVE, THAT

01:47:38 IS WHERE YOU WANT TO MOVE. I DON'T THINK YOU QUITE NEED TO

01:47:43 GET TO THE 10 YEAR POINT. WE COULD CERTAINLY SEE 4.3% OR

01:47:47 HIGHER. FOR NOW, I THINK IT'S RANGE

01:47:51 BOUND.

01:47:53 >> THIS IS WHY I THINK THE GOLD RALLY IS INTERESTING.

01:47:58 WHERE DO YOU GET THAT BALLAST IF LONGER-TERM TREASURIES DON'T

01:48:01 HAVE THE SAME FEATURES AT A TIME WHERE THE FED IS WILLING

01:48:02 TO EASE EVEN THOUGH INFLATION IS NOT BACK TO TARGET?

01:48:08 IS THERE A SENSE THAT LONGER-TERM BONDS DON'T HOLD

01:48:12 THE SAME BALLAST THEY USE TO SIMILE BECAUSE THIS IS AN

01:48:14 ECONOMY THAT WILL TOLERATE HIGHER INFLATION -- TO SIMPLY

01:48:19 BECAUSE THIS IS AN ECONOMY THAT WILL TOLERATE HIGHER INFLATION?

01:48:22 >> THERE'S A SENSE THAT WHEN YOU HAVE THIS MUCH SUPPLY

01:48:26 COMING TO THE MARKETS AND THE YIELD CURVE THAT'S STILL NOT

01:48:31 PRICING IN ENOUGH PREMIUM THAT YOU HAVE BETTER BALLAST IN THE

01:48:35 BELLY OF THE CURVE. SO I DON'T THINK IT'S ABOUT

01:48:39 FIXED INCOME LOSING BALLAST. WE CERTAINLY HAVE BALLAST. WE ARE

01:48:43 BETTER OFF STEPPING OUT OF CASH OR DIVERSIFYING AWAY FROM

01:48:47 EQUITIES. YOU DON'T NEED TO STEP OUT.

01:48:50 GET IT IN THE FIVE YEAR, THE SEVEN-YEAR COME IN CREDIT --

01:48:57 SEVEN-YEAR, AND CREDIT -- IN CREDIT.

01:49:00 THAT'S WHAT INVESTORS SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT.

01:49:05 IT'S BEEN INTERESTING TO SEE HOW EQUITIES AND GOLD ARE

01:49:10 MAKING ALL-TIME HIGHS AND I PLACE A LITTLE BIT OF THAT IN

01:49:14 THE INFLATION FEAR BUT DIPS HAVE NOT DONE AS WELL.

01:49:20 THE WAY TO PLAY THIS MIGHT BE AN ALLOCATION INTO AN ASSET

01:49:22 CLASS THAT APPRECIATES WITH CPI. >> INTERESTING.

01:49:25 YOU THINK THE OPPORTUNITY MIGHT BE IN TIPS MORE THAN WHAT'S

01:49:28 ALREADY RALLYING.

01:49:32 >> STOCKS WILL CONTINUE TO DO WELL, HIGH-QUALITY STOCKS.

01:49:35 WE MIGHT SEE A LITTLE BIT OF A SMALL CAP RALLY.

01:49:40 WHAT'S GOING TO WORK FOR THE MEDIUM-TERM IS QUALITY.

01:49:44 TIPS MAKE A LOT OF SENSE.

01:49:47 >> SO THAT IS FIXED INCOME. LET'S FINISH ON EQUITIES.

01:49:52 WHAT IS IT ABOUT SMALL CAPS YOU LIKE AT THE MOMENT?

01:49:56 THE BIG PERFORMERS YESTERDAY, CONTINUES THIS MORNING.

01:50:00 >> WE DON'T THINK SMALL CAPS WILL BE THAT EVEN IF IT DID

01:50:03 WELL YESTERDAY. FOR THE LONGER.

01:50:10 OF TIME, LARGE-CAP AND QUALITY, THAT WILL CONTINUE TO DO WELL.

01:50:15 SMALL-CAP IS MORE OF A REBOUND TRADE.

01:50:19 I DOUBT HOW LONG IT WILL LAST.

01:50:21 >> THAT CONTINUES THIS MORNING. LOVE IT.

01:50:24 GARGI CHAUDHURI OF BLACKROCK. TO RECAP THE BANK OF ENGLAND

01:50:29 DECISION, RATES UNCHANGED. WE WERE LOOKING FOR THE VOTE.

01:50:37 WITH TWO HAWKISH DISSENTERS STILL HAWKISH. THAT'S A CHANGE.

01:50:43 A STEP TOWARDS MAY BE REDUCTION IN INTEREST RATES.

01:50:47 GOVERNOR BAILEY MAKING THE POINT WE ARE NOT AT THE POINT

01:50:50 YET TO CUT RATES.

01:50:52 >> BUT MAKING PROGRESS FOR THAT. THAT IS EERILY SEEING THE SAME

01:50:56 KIND OF DISSENT.

01:51:02 IS THIS SETTING UP PHRYGIAN TO BE A BLOCKBUSTER MONTH?

01:51:06 >> THE STERLING WEAKER. HAVING A DECENT YEAR SO FAR

01:51:09 AGAINST THE DOLLAR. ON THE SESSION WEAKER BY .3%.

01:53:49 HIGHER.

01:53:52 EARLIER, HAD A N SNB DECISION. THE BANK OF ENGLAND UNCHANGED

01:53:56 BUT THE VOTE WAS DIFFERENT.

01:54:03 THERE WERE TWO HAWKISH MEMBERS PUSHING FOR HIKES. NOT ANYMORE.

01:54:10 >> NOT ANYMORE ON THE BANK OF ENGLAND. HERE'S A QUESTION.

01:54:16 WHAT HAS SHIFTED MATERIALLY FOR ALWAYS CENTRAL BANKS THAT

01:54:19 ALLOWS THEM TO HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THEY DON'T NEED TO GO

01:54:20 FURTHER. HAS INFLATION COME DOWN?

01:54:26 ARE WE SEEING MORE SIGNS OF WEAKNESS?

01:54:30 OR IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE SHIFTING WHERE THE EMPHASIS

01:54:33 NEEDS TO BE ON GROWTH AND AWAY FROM COMBATING INFLATION?

01:54:37 >> THE REACTION FUNCTION SHIFTED.

01:54:41 THE WAY THEY RESPOND TO THE INCOMING INFORMATION.

01:54:45 ULTIMATELY, THE DESTINATION HAS NOT CHANGED.

01:54:48 >> WHICH HIGHLIGHTS A COUPLE KEY QUESTIONS.

01:54:53 ONE, HOW MUCH OUR CENTRAL BANKS STANDING AWAY FROM TRYING TO

01:54:58 PUT THE BRE
