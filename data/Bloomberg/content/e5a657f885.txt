00:05 Inflation is not coming down as fast as we expected.

00:08 Inflation just has stopped going down. It's stalled at a level that's

00:12 uncomfortable for the Fed. They're going to want to be more

00:15 patient. Inflation is going to be top of mind.

00:18 I think the clear part of the new narrative is high for long on race.

00:21 The question is, where does that take us?

00:23 You can't keep rates up here forever. The Fed's going to starkly cut and

00:27 you're going to have a massive rally. This is Bloomberg Surveillance with

00:30 Jonathan Ferro, Lisa abramowitz and Annmarie Horden Burn.

00:35 This is a proper Monday morning so brahmos out long weekend and each party

00:39 to hard combat is fake. The taj goes to bed Saturday around 130.

00:43 Sounds like 330. That sounds like a 330 voice.

00:47 We'll get to AMH a little bit later in the show if she can actually speak.

00:50 Live from New York City this morning. Good morning.

00:52 Good morning for our audience worldwide. Let's get your week started.

00:55 Equities futures positive by 0.1% on the S&P 500.

00:59 What a week ahead we've got for you hazy tell for tomorrow earnings from Amazon

01:04 then on to the Federal Reserve. On Wednesday.

01:06 Decision day, a news conference with Chairman Powell.

01:09 Apple earnings coming on Thursday, payrolls on Friday.

01:12 If you want a sneak peek of Friday, the estimate in our survey 250 k and as you

01:17 all know, payrolls has been absolutely dominated by a series of upside

01:21 surprises this morning, dominated by one sharp it's dollar yen.

01:25 Can we throw up dollar yen and can we talk about the range we've seen on

01:27 dollar yen today? This is not a monthly range.

01:30 This is an intraday range. We've been through 160 already in the

01:34 last 12 hours daily and back down to one 5576.

01:38 We've had a break of 160 for the first time in more than 30 years.

01:41 We started the month focused on 150 to 152.

01:44 They wish at this point and they think the Ministry of Finance in Japan, no

01:48 comment. That's what we heard from the Ministry

01:50 of Finance. No comment.

01:52 No, it was no comment for now. So what they're doing is they're being

01:55 very fuzzy about what's going on. People are talking about potentially,

01:58 was this a fat finger? Was the fact that there's a public

02:00 holiday in Japan, low liquidity. But I love the fact that they come out

02:05 and the top currency official says no comment for now.

02:08 It will we get a comment? Did they intervene?

02:10 We think that was a comment. It's just sort of like no comment for

02:14 now. Apparently, if you wanted to make a

02:15 statement, it's a great time to do it. I just said low liquidity national

02:19 holiday. It makes a whole lot of sense.

02:21 This is what Mizuho said. Will it dog chase an airborne Frisbee?

02:24 This is how so? Yes, markets appear to be trying to push

02:27 dollar and towards 160 in the absence of official intervention.

02:30 And it's still unclear whether we've had so-called intervention.

02:33 Critics of SOC Gen really putting forward, I think, the statement of the

02:36 morning what we actually need to see to put a durable floor or rather durable

02:41 ceiling on top of dollar. And this is what Kate has to say.

02:44 More aggressive policy action from both the Ministry of Finance, concerted and

02:49 repeated intervention, and the DOJ signaling a willingness to normalize

02:53 policy further unnecessary to stabilize the currency and clearer signs of

02:57 stronger growth across the wider economy, as well as signs that Treasury

03:01 yields of Pete will be needed before a sustainable yen rally can actually get

03:06 going. That's the push back from Kate this

03:08 morning. That currency pair has been an absolute

03:10 mess so far in April one 5574 is where we trade.

03:15 Coming up this hour, fantastic line up to get through a week of events for you.

03:18 Lori Carver, senior of ABC. A stocks rally ahead of earnings from

03:21 Amazon and Apple. Matt McCormick at TD Securities as the

03:24 yen bounces off a 34 year low and Wells Fargo's Jay Bryson looking ahead to the

03:28 Fed and US payrolls. We begin with our top story US stocks

03:32 coming off of their strongest week of gains so far this year, thanks to a big

03:35 boost from big tech Lauri conversation of RBC writes in this We still believe

03:39 by year end S&P 500 target of 5300 is a reasonable expectation.

03:44 The key thing we've learned from our survey is that even though higher rates

03:48 are a headwind, there is a confidence in the stock picking community that this

03:51 challenge can be managed. Laurie is with us for the as she joins

03:54 us around the table. Laurie, good morning to you.

03:56 Thanks for having. Fantastic to see you.

03:58 I want to start with this. This came from Peter to share the of

04:00 make and he went through some of the big names in big tech over the last week and

04:03 he started with a video to Fridays ago. So to Fridays ago we had a 10% move on

04:08 absolutely nothing a $2 trillion company, 10% move just like that.

04:12 Tesla last Wednesday moved 10% on a $500 billion market cap matter.

04:17 Another move, a 10% this time to the downside on a $1 trillion market cap.

04:21 And then we had alphabet with the move a 10% on Friday on a $2.1 trillion market

04:25 cap. Peter Chair asking the asking the big

04:28 question is 10%, 21% for Megacap Tech and what's the message you take away

04:32 from that? So I'll go back to my small cap days if

04:35 I can, and I know these are the 20 feels like, yeah, this is how small caps have

04:39 always traded. I think some of the price reactions in

04:42 small cap to Prince have gotten a bit worse than that.

04:44 But, you know, I think in small cap, this is just something that was a

04:47 normal, you know, sort of reaction to earnings for a long time.

04:50 So it doesn't maybe throw me quite as much as it might some other folks.

04:53 What should we take away from the fact that over cap stocks are behaving like

04:57 small caps, though? Well, I think what we're seeing, if we

05:00 look at the earnings data and Bloomberg does some great work just forecasting

05:04 where the. Earnings are expected to go based on

05:05 bottom of consensus forecast. We've been talking about this since

05:08 January and you see a decelerating growth rate.

05:11 So coming off around, I think 35% in 2023.

05:14 If you look at the basket as a whole for the Mag seven, that's forecasted to drop

05:18 to about 15% or so in 2025 and really basically come in line with the rest of

05:23 the market. And there's one thing I've learned over

05:24 the course of my career is that when you have these powerful momentum stocks and

05:29 growth rates decelerate, it doesn't matter how good the growth is.

05:32 Growth investors get angsty, and that's what I feel like you're seeing in the

05:35 stock price Reaction raises big questions right now about what's been

05:37 rewarded and what's been punished. Get to numbers from Apple and Amazon.

05:40 We talked about the dates for those two names.

05:42 Amazon earnings come in tomorrow, Apple coming on Thursday.

05:45 Can we focus on that a little bit more? What do you sense has been rewarded

05:48 really well this earnings season? What's getting punished?

05:50 So if you look at the Russell 1000 and we have to look that big at this early

05:54 in reporting season, the beats aren't getting rewarded.

05:56 I mean, they're underperforming. They're not performing as well as they

05:58 typically do. And kind of the one or two day post post

06:01 prints. So I think what I've noticed as we're

06:04 going through commentary and again, it's still very early, we're reading as much

06:07 as we can. We don't get through everything.

06:09 You know, they're fast reads. But what I feel like I'm seeing is just

06:13 kind of an intolerance for the we need to be patient conversation.

06:17 We sensed a lot of that early on. I sort of felt like there was a shift

06:20 last week kind of midweek, where companies who were saying, okay, we're

06:23 getting the benefit of these things now. And I'm thinking about specifically on

06:26 the discussion, you know, we're benefiting from the ramp that's going to

06:29 continue in coming years. Investors were okay with that.

06:32 But the sort of wait and see, this is going to take time.

06:35 Again, we've got decelerating earnings growth, you know, kind of 27 times

06:38 multiples on a median p e And those biggest tech stocks, investors just

06:42 don't have a lot of patience for that right now.

06:44 So is there time for a pullback now? So we've been getting a little bit of a

06:47 pullback and a lot of that has happened as we've had some volatility in these

06:51 bigger names. You know, look, I'm not looking for any

06:54 kind of massive pullback in those names or massive pullback in the markets.

06:57 We said we thought the pullback would be worth about 5 to 10%.

07:00 We've had more than five. I don't think we're quite done yet.

07:03 If you look at CFTC data on positioning in either NASDAQ 100 futures, S&P

07:07 futures or the broader market, you know, we haven't even begun the correction.

07:11 If you look at API, we've done some damage, but we've still got, you know,

07:14 probably at least a couple more weeks of damage to do there.

07:17 So if you look at the beta tier, nobody talks about how these big companies are

07:20 trading like little companies. Who's going to be leading if there's not

07:23 a pullback right now? How do you see this rotation?

07:26 So, you know, I think the financials have come through this reporting season

07:29 so far reasonably well. I personally on my team read a lot of

07:32 industrials and materials. I'm not really seeing any big kind of

07:35 demand problems. You know, I'm seeing companies that are

07:37 talking a lot of being able to manage through headwinds.

07:40 I think it's not so much a particular sector.

07:43 I think it's looking for industries, for companies within the value cyclical

07:46 cohort of the market. So that could be energy materials,

07:49 industrials, I think certain small caps as well.

07:51 I want to talk about another big over cap company, Apple, on Thursday.

07:54 This from Bernstein this morning. The latest note dropping from them by

07:57 the fire upgraded the stock to outperform Apple is D rated

08:01 significantly amid a weak iPhone 15 cycle and fears that Apple's China

08:05 business is structurally impaired. That's actually the other side of some

08:09 of this. Laurie, I want to ask you specifically

08:10 about Apple, but maybe some of the forces associated with that name at the

08:14 moment, the difficulty in navigating international waters, particularly

08:17 China, the strength of the US dollar, a factor, I think as well.

08:20 It was really triggered overnight. How many times have those two things

08:23 come up on earnings calls so far? So the headwinds are coming up.

08:26 I'm noticing it more with the tech companies, to be honest, than others.

08:29 And we'll see. You know, we've got a lot of stuff in

08:31 the other parts of the market to hear from, but so far it seems mostly to be a

08:34 tech company phenomenon. I will say on the geographic commentary,

08:38 and it's maybe a little hard to say because we've had a lot of financials so

08:41 far, but at least in what I read last week, the geographic commentary.

08:44 So Europe, China kind of trends versus the US, things seem a lot more balanced.

08:49 Whereas if you look last year it was all China's not coming through as well as we

08:54 anticipated. There's a lot of uncertainty.

08:55 Things haven't bottomed yet and I wouldn't say I'm seeing a lot of, you

08:58 know, jumping up and down and celebrating on China, but it just seems

09:01 more balanced. What do you think the difficulty has

09:03 been in China for tech firms? Specifically?

09:05 What is unique about China to them? You know, I'm not sure I know the great

09:09 answer to that question, to be honest. I know it's been a growth part of the

09:12 business for many of these companies. And when you're encountering, you know,

09:15 sort of difficulty in the post-pandemic world, you know, there was so much

09:19 excitement a year ago that we were sort of finally getting that recovery and

09:22 that normalization. And that normalization, I think, just

09:25 hasn't been as clean as a lot of companies would have anticipated.

09:28 I think there's just not a lot of visibility necessarily on when that was

09:31 going to turn around. When you read through these earnings

09:33 reports. I think back to Mohamed El-Erian

09:35 recently told us about how a lot of people missed what CEOs were saying and

09:40 they bought into this transitory inflation, but CEOs were saying,

09:43 actually, we still feel inflation coming out of the pipeline.

09:45 What do you gather from reading all these reports about where inflation is

09:48 right now for these corporates? So, you know, it's funny, back in the

09:51 last reporting season, so kind of calendar one Q for the for Q numbers

09:55 companies were raising the red flag right?

09:57 Like they were really complaining about cost margin pressures.

10:00 I'm not sensing quite as much of that now it doesn't sound good at.

10:04 Sounds. You know, some companies are complaining

10:06 a lot about inflation. Some people are talking about moderating

10:08 disinflation deflation. It's a little more mixed, but again, it

10:11 is still very early. Laurie, this was great.

10:13 It's going to be fantastic to run through some of the top stories, ten

10:16 minute conversation with Laurie canvassing of obviously not a single

10:19 mention of the Federal Reserve going into that decision on Wednesday, which I

10:22 guess is a good thing because we've actually been talking about nothing but

10:25 the Federal Reserve over the last month or so.

10:28 Let's turn to the price action. Let's get the cross set board up and

10:30 start with equities equity futures on the S&P 500 positive here by 0.1%.

10:35 That move has been fading through this morning.

10:37 So in this session, lows on the S&P 500 in the bond market yield to lower by

10:41 three or four basis points on a ten year for 6239.

10:45 And in foreign exchange, the euro a little bit firmer here daily and turning

10:48 around big time. We'll talk more about that a little bit

10:50 later. The euro one of 715, that currency pair

10:53 positive by 2/10 of 1%. Let's give an update on stories

10:56 elsewhere this morning. Cambridge, your Bloomberg race with Dani

10:59 Burger. Hey, Danny.

11:00 Hey, John. Elon musk quick visit to china has paid

11:03 off almost immediately. Tesla now has cleared two key hurdles

11:07 for its driver assistance system. Tesla will be partnering with Fei DU for

11:11 mapping and navigation to support its full self-driving functions, sources

11:15 say. I spoke to Success Peter Gardner earlier

11:17 this morning who told me that my visit to China was an acknowledgment that he

11:21 needs to change the market narrative. But ultimately, Tesla still won't be a

11:25 top player in China's EV market. Philipp shares are soaring in the

11:30 European session this morning, up 46%. The company reached a lower than

11:34 expected settlement on US claims over faulty sleep apnea devices.

11:39 The deal they reached with authorities was for $1.1 billion.

11:43 That compares what analysts were expecting a four and a half billion

11:47 dollars. The expectation is also that this will

11:49 draw a line under US claims. But Philip, for their part, are still

11:52 conducting toxicology tests related to the devices.

11:56 Now, the Redstone family and David Ellison are trying to appease angry

12:00 Paramount investors. Sources tell us that the Redstone

12:03 family, which controls a majority of shares in Ellison of Skydance, are both

12:07 making appeals and concessions. Ellison is offering to buy a block of

12:11 Paramount shares at a premium his bid described as the, quote, best and final

12:16 offer as board members remain undecided about a Skydance takeover.

12:20 CEO Bob Bakish could be ousted as soon as today by Management committee.

12:25 That's your bloomberg brief. John.

12:26 Dan, i appreciate the update. That story has been an absolute mess

12:29 over the last few weeks. Looking for updates on that.

12:31 Got updates on this from the world economic Forum summit been held in

12:34 Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Secretary Blinken's been speaking in the

12:37 last few minutes saying this The Israel cease fire proposal, he calls it, quote,

12:41 extraordinarily generous. Hamas is the only thing standing between

12:44 a cease fire in Gaza. That's the latest from Secretary Blinken

12:47 this morning. I imagine we'll get more headlines

12:49 throughout today. Next on the program, the 2024

12:52 presidential race ramping up. The 2024 election is in full swing.

12:58 And yes, age is an issue. I'm a grown man

13:04 running against a six year old. That conversation just around the corner

13:09 live from New York City this morning from a beautiful New York.

13:12 Good morning.

13:22 Wednesday, the Fed decided Jay Powell pumping the brakes on rate hikes are off

13:27 the table. No cuts.

13:28 Looking perhaps a little bit more likely.

13:30 You can't say there's a whole lot wrong with the US economy.

13:33 Trust Bloomberg to bring you the fastest coverage and exclusive analysis,

13:37 including Powell's press conference. Policy rate is likely at its peak

13:41 threshold to cut rates is a little higher.

13:44 Redefining Patience Bloomberg Surveillance.

13:46 The Fed decides starting at 1:30 p.m. Eastern, context changes everything.

13:57 Equity futures on the S&P 500 positive here by 0.1% last week, the biggest

14:02 weekly gain on the S&P 500 of the year so far.

14:05 Just remember that followed the biggest weekly loss on the S&P 500 of the year

14:10 so far in April, we're still down about 3%.

14:13 In the bond market, yields are lower by three or four basis points for 6259.

14:17 Two big events this week outside of earnings.

14:19 Federal Reserve Wednesday payrolls report on Friday under surveillance this

14:24 morning, the 2024 presidential race ramping up.

14:28 The 2024 election is in full swing. And yes, age is an issue.

14:35 I'm a grown man running against a six year old.

14:43 Well, I feel great. I really feel great.

14:47 I'm campaigning all over the country. Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina.

14:52 I've always done well in the original 13 colonies.

14:55 The president of the United States over the weekend.

14:57 Just a few things to say. I know the president likes ice cream, so

14:59 let's run with that thing. If you order vanilla and you get

15:03 vanilla, you can't complain after that. If you get a vanilla comedian to do the

15:07 so-called gritty and then you get a vanilla grilling, what's the complaint?

15:11 Who was surprised? I mean, I like the guy very pleased just

15:14 to listen to. What's the surprise?

15:16 He's a vanilla comedian on SNL and he delivered vanilla.

15:18 He had some funny moments, but at the end, he almost endorsed the president

15:22 when he talked about his grandfather, who voted for Joe Biden.

15:25 And he and explained this whole story saying that he thinks he's a decent man.

15:28 And that's not really the job of the comedian.

15:30 The comedian is there to roast the administration and the journalists in

15:33 the room goes both ways. And maybe he was just too friendly.

15:36 Shane Gillis, can we just book Shane Gillis for next year?

15:39 Just get it done. A proper roasting from Shane when

15:42 everyone loves that. It would be pretty funny.

15:43 That would be pretty funny. That would be better than good.

15:45 Here's the latest this morning. New polling from CBS in three swing

15:48 states showing President Biden with a single digit lead in Michigan.

15:52 Former President Donald Trump with a slim lead in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

15:56 Terry Haynes of Panacea Policy writing this.

15:58 Biden is still likely to be re-elected by the skin of his teeth.

16:01 Polls are leveling out. Trump is still weak and RFK alone is

16:04 punching in slowly running out of air. Terry joins us now for more.

16:08 Terry, wonderful to have you with us on the program this morning.

16:10 You've maintained this view for quite a while.

16:12 What is it that you see in our future that ultimately ends at this

16:16 destination? Well, fundamentally, it's it's that

16:21 Trump has kind of topped out and Biden's got Biden's got a floor with some room

16:28 to run and room to grow. And that's fundamental.

16:31 You know, Trump is. Ever since mid-January, Trump has been

16:34 awfully weak. What you've got is you've got splits.

16:37 You saw this in the primaries. You've got splits of 20 to 40% of the

16:40 party regulars not voting for him. You've got independents not breaking his

16:44 way. He needs a unified party.

16:47 He needs independents to to be more for him than not in order to win.

16:52 Right now, that's not happening. You combine that with a an electorate

16:57 that really hungers for a credible, serious third party candidate.

17:02 For a while, it looked like you'd either have Bob Kennedy or a No Labels

17:06 candidate or both in those in those shoes, No Labels dropped out for lack of

17:13 ability to convince anyone. And.

17:15 And Bob Kennedy, I'm sorry to say, has made his his candidacy into a niche one

17:21 and far less serious. So what you got here is you got a

17:24 situation where where Biden, I think, is going to have a

17:29 superior organization, superior get out the vote.

17:32 And as six months from now. I think that's what you see is the skin

17:37 of the teeth when it's very, you know, the cheat code for amateur political

17:41 pundits like me, you turn around, you bang the table, and you say it's all

17:44 going to be about turnout. So going to be about turnout and how you

17:46 just say that on repeat, try and sound smart.

17:48 Sorry. Can you tell us about turnout, the

17:50 potential for people just not to turn up to election in November, given how

17:54 disappointed they are with the two candidates in front of them?

17:57 Yeah, I think there's I think there's possibility for that.

18:00 You know, it is all about turnout, of course.

18:03 But at the same time, folks tend to overestimate how much turnout goes up or

18:09 down. The famous Obama surge in 28 turned out

18:13 to be something like 1.7% of the electorate, You know, and it seemed much

18:17 bigger than that, even even on the ground at the time.

18:21 But you know, what you got here is a situation where you've got a couple of

18:25 candidates that aren't actually exciting people.

18:30 Generally speaking, there was one one joke factor.

18:34 He called it a gesture to Earth Day by, you know, recycling presidential

18:38 candidates. But that's going to get replaced, I

18:42 think, by a by a surge, by some on the right, kind of the Trump loyalists who

18:47 haven't increased their numbers since 2020, but but are still quite

18:52 passionate. But you're going to have the social

18:53 issue, Democrats, particularly in swing states.

18:56 And that's exactly what Biden's counting on.

18:58 The third thing they'll count on is, as Jim Messina, Obama's former campaign

19:02 manager, said, is is driving third party numbers through the floor in the next

19:07 six months. And they'll try to achieve that, too, by

19:09 making Kennedy into a nut. Terry, this is Laurie canvassing it as

19:14 you think about the polling data and and just sort of Biden's low approval

19:17 numbers favorability, is there anything that can turn those around?

19:21 You know, in markets, we're watching inflation, we're watching foreign

19:23 policy. Do any of those things, you know, matter

19:26 for Biden's polling stats at this point? Yeah, good morning, Larry.

19:30 I think the way I would look at it is Biden's numbers are going to be what

19:34 Biden's numbers on favorability and all the rest are pretty much going to be

19:37 what they are. You know, the and.

19:41 I take issue with a lot of where the White House has been on a number of

19:45 these issues, you know, saying that you're going to deal with inflation and

19:49 then, you know, having people still dealing with high prices and unsatisfied

19:53 is not exactly a smart political strategy, among other things.

19:57 But you know, what I tend to look for is not so much whether or not his numbers

20:01 on favorability, likeability, anything else go,

20:06 you know, another another immature. Table pounder is always you know, it's

20:11 always a choice, right, whether you're choosing for somebody or against

20:14 somebody. Biden's Biden's gambit is going to be

20:19 that he's going to make it a not so much about him.

20:22 He's going to have a record, but he's going to make it about the other guy.

20:25 And you know what you saw at the correspondents dinner?

20:29 You're going to be treated to six months more of that as part of that strategy.

20:34 You know, and I think that, you know, wanting less of the Trump circus is part

20:40 of the Biden campaign strategy. I think it actually helps him.

20:44 And Terry, one more. Just as we think about the intersection

20:46 of politics and markets, when you're thinking about policy from these two

20:49 candidates, what are the one or two things you're saying?

20:52 If Trump wins or Biden wins, investors should really be expecting to happen in

20:55 terms of trades they can make? Well, I'm not going to recommend

21:00 specific trades, but what I will say is that you've got a situation where you

21:04 know Trump's going to be stronger on kind of traditional firstly, traditional

21:09 industries and sectors, defense, fossil fuels, you know, things like that.

21:14 Generally speaking, there will be a lighter hand regulatory, you know, none

21:20 of this foolishness coming out of the FTC

21:24 or trying to have antitrust antitrust cases against luxury handbag makers and

21:29 the like. So, you know, so that that will cheer

21:32 markets. What will worry markets about Trump,

21:35 frankly, is the kind of stuff that's coming out of.

21:39 Of hyperventilating staff these days, trying to

21:43 try to meddle in the Fed independence, that sort of thing.

21:47 Anything that that meddles with the fundamentals of markets and that

21:51 includes the Fed's ability to do its job is going to be a negative for markets.

21:55 And you know, that's happening now a little bit.

21:58 But I think should Trump be president, markets will very much need to look out

22:02 for that. Terry, I want to go back to the CBS News

22:05 poll. Biden and Trump are neck and neck when

22:07 it comes to the blue wall. What levers can Biden pull before the

22:11 election to help three these three states shore up support Michigan,

22:15 Pennsylvania and Wisconsin? Well, let me speak to Pennsylvania

22:18 specifically because I know the most about it in a granular sense.

22:24 You know, Biden thinks he's going to do, but he goes to Philadelphia, he's going

22:27 to Pennsylvania. That's not true.

22:29 There's Philadelphia. Then there's the vast rest of the state.

22:32 The vast rest of the state is speaking broadly, is red.

22:38 They don't like him. They don't understand what what he's

22:41 doing. What they understand is that their

22:43 prices are up and and they're in their core industries, including energy

22:48 industries, LNG and the like, are under attack.

22:51 Biden needs to do more than get into Pittsburgh, let's say, and talk about

22:55 talk to the steelworkers for 15 minutes. He needs to go 15 miles south to

23:00 Canonsburg, which is the world capital of fracking, essentially, and talk to

23:04 people in Washington County, GREENE County, Fayette County, about why he's

23:08 trying to do what he's trying to do for them.

23:11 It can't just be about the the groups that in traditional Democratic politics,

23:17 the groups in which you get turnout. It's got to be about more than that.

23:20 The more he actually tries to connect with real citizens who might be

23:23 skeptical about him, you know, the better he'll do.

23:26 And that's going to be key in a place like Pennsylvania.

23:28 And I've got 10 seconds. Should Saturday dinner be the last

23:30 dinner? It should be the last dinner about ten

23:34 or 15 years ago. All I have to say to you is, Leo, look

23:37 well, look to Jerry Seinfeld's great quote about

23:41 know about the death of comedy. And you see everything you need to see

23:45 in that dinner. It died on Saturday night.

23:47 Terry Hinds of cancer policy, That's brutal, sent out The New York Times.

23:50 Terry, Thank you, sir. They had a brutal review of Saturday

23:53 night. I didn't think it was that bad until the

23:55 very end. I'm not sure I'm interested in which way

23:57 he thinks we should vote. But anyway, this from D.J.

24:00 Dow Jones, Japan. Financial authorities did intervene in

24:04 the affects market. That's the report coming from sources.

24:06 According to Dow Jones today, the official on the record point of view

24:10 from the Ministry of Finance says no comment.

24:13 This is the story coming out of Dow Jones dollar yen with a big swing

24:16 breaking 316 the overnight back down to one 5585.

24:20 We'll catch up with Matt McCormick at TD Securities.

24:22 Up next, from New York, this is Bloomberg.

24:39 Welcome to the program. Sneak peek of summer.

24:41 Then a bit later today in New York City, wishing you all the best for the week

24:44 ahead. Equity futures on the S&P 500 is going

24:46 to be a warm one here in New York on the East Coast.

24:49 Actually, futures positive by 0.1% on the S&P, on the NASDAQ, up by 0.2.

24:53 Really strong week of gains in the equity market last week.

24:56 Strongest week of gains we've had so far in 2024.

25:00 If you switch to the board and get to the bond market two year and ten year,

25:03 let's focus on the ten year. We've had five weeks, five weeks of a

25:06 ten year yield climbing higher, a little bit lower this morning, down four basis

25:09 points last week briefly, three, 474 6239 on Ten's on twos for 97 just ended

25:17 around 5% over the last few weeks or so. If you turn the board and turn to

25:21 foreign exchange, the only thing we're talking about today in foreign exchange

25:24 is what is happening with dollar yen. So let's go through the range together

25:27 on dollar yen overnight, late last night, us time we broke through 160.

25:32 So the high the session one 6017, the low of the session one 5454 and the

25:38 price right now one 5583 The official line so far from the Ministry of Finance

25:44 in Japan is no comment at the moment. This is coming from Dow Jones just

25:47 moments ago that Japanese financial authorities did intervene in the market

25:52 overnight. There was a public holiday, low

25:54 liquidity, really the perfect time in either direction if you want it to bully

25:58 the Japanese yen in either direction. So what we saw was dollar yen gap higher

26:02 and then ultimately potentially reportedly authorities coming out and

26:05 pushing this one back down again. Big week ahead for this foreign exchange

26:08 market, but the Federal Reserve on deck on Wednesday and payrolls on Friday

26:12 under surveillance this morning. The latest Fed decision, a news

26:15 conference from Fed Chair Jay Powell coming up Wednesday.

26:17 Investors looking for a hawkish tilt after a string of hotter than expected

26:21 inflation prints US payrolls. Rounding out the week on Friday,

26:24 Bloomberg survey the median estimate to 150 k 250 K does not scream recession.

26:30 The previous month doesn't scream recession either.

26:32 It screams boom. 303 was the previous month.

26:36 We're looking for to 50 in the number on Friday.

26:38 Lori Carver, senior of ABC with us around a table for the rest of the hour.

26:42 Lori, let's talk about the Federal Reserve.

26:43 We haven't mentioned it yet Wednesday what even the team looking for.

26:47 So, look, I feel like the equity community has already gotten into its

26:50 head, you know, at least a decent number of people I talked to that cuts aren't

26:53 going to happen this year. Right.

26:54 And that's not necessarily what you're seeing in market pricing.

26:57 But I've been hearing this since February.

26:59 Right. So I have a hard time sitting here with

27:01 166 companies coming out saying equity investors are really going to be focused

27:05 on the press conference on Wednesday afternoon.

27:06 Now, I know we always have a lot of drama around.

27:08 It always comes back. But to me, frankly, it's a little bit of

27:12 the b-plot this week I'll be really kind of listening to see if there's anything

27:16 the market takes out of it, suggesting there might be hikes coming, because I

27:18 do think that would be really disruptive to equity investors, but that's not

27:21 something I'm really anticipating. So given the choice right now in front

27:24 of you and we can go through the week ahead again tomorrow, Amazon, Thursday,

27:27 Apple, So that's earnings data. On Friday, the big one payrolls, we got

27:30 some of them through the week as well. And you've got monetary policy which you

27:33 think is sort of like the B list this week.

27:36 What's the analysts what's the number one for you?

27:37 The analyst is just the earnings themselves, right?

27:39 I mean, I think as long as we've got a reasonably strong economy, I think the

27:43 market can handle the Fed just sort of staying steady.

27:46 Now, admittedly, when I look at my valuation work, there is some downside

27:50 potential. If we don't get any cuts this year, we

27:52 have a whole big model that looks at inflation.

27:55 Fed ten year PPI is we look at it against our earnings.

27:58 There could be, you know, some downside to say 40 905,000.

28:01 That doesn't feel good, but it's not exactly a disaster from where we're

28:04 sitting today. One thing that isn't steady in the free

28:06 market is Tesla Tesla rally and pretty hard is the news on that The CEO, Elon

28:10 Musk, you might have noticed over the weekend making a surprise trip to China.

28:14 Bloomberg reporting the EV maker will partner with China's Baidu for mapping

28:17 and navigation support full self-driving in the country.

28:21 The technology does not make the cars autonomous, but the software is sold for

28:24 $8,000 or 99 bucks a month. Their stock is up by 8.5 8.6% this

28:30 morning. And the surprise visit, Dan Ives is

28:32 calling it a home run by this visit by Elon Musk.

28:36 They also seem to pass this key data security that they would need from

28:40 Beijing in order to be able to use FSD in that market.

28:43 It just goes to show how important China is for Musk.

28:46 He was supposed to have a sit down with Modi of India that got pushed to the

28:50 side, and yet his first trip, after a little bit of struggles immediately to

28:55 China, created a split impact. Joining us out of London on our latest

28:58 report and a little bit later this morning, look out for that when it turns

29:01 out they made a dent in foreign exchange.

29:02 The yen bouncing off its weakest 1134 years, dollar yen falling to 16d before

29:07 rallying back on thin trading due to a local public holiday.

29:10 Japan's top currency official saying no comment for now when asked by reporters

29:14 if the government intervened. Mike McCormack of TD Securities joins us

29:17 right now to comment officially on the situation.

29:20 Mark McCormack, what happened overnight? Yeah, I think it's pretty clear if you

29:25 think of the sequence, we had some hot inflation data come through last couple

29:29 of weeks in the US that we basically had BOJ that was standing pat, basically

29:33 said we're pretty much not changing our stance, we're not doing anything.

29:37 I think one of the things is. She's very good at telling us what they

29:39 did historically. But I don't think you should look at the

29:41 DOJ for guidance on what they'll do in the future.

29:44 So dollar yen moved rapidly higher after those events.

29:48 And essentially what you have is the BOJ and the Ministry of Finance seem to not

29:52 have the same opinion about where the yen should be.

29:54 And it looks as if overnight the Japanese officials had intervened in the

29:58 market to try to strengthen the yen. Mark, let's get into that distinction.

30:01 It's important. So we've heard complaints from the

30:03 Ministry of Finance. We've heard next to nothing from the

30:06 Bank of Japan. We have to deal with the the big

30:08 question, is it a problem or not? Do you think it is a problem?

30:12 I think part of it is the problem is, is is it speculative and does it have kind

30:16 of somewhat of a negative impact? I think part of it with that fact is

30:19 there's always winners and losers. So if you think about it from one

30:23 perspective, the DOJ, they're helping tourism, they're helping profit margins.

30:27 Those things are good. You can see the exporters are

30:29 accumulating larger surpluses. But again, at the same time, if you look

30:33 at the correlation to the, you know, whether or not the the politics and the

30:38 politicians are actually doing their job properly, I think we could see is

30:41 there's a very strong correlation with the disapproval rating of the diet

30:44 versus the movement of dollar yen. So this is a big pain point for

30:47 consumers. Also, if you look at oil based in yen

30:50 prices, we're back to where we were in 27, 2008.

30:54 So there is a massive consumer shock here that's going on from the weakness

30:58 in the yen. So I think the Ministry of Finance is

31:00 more focused on the broad based movement and whether or not it's kind of

31:03 dislodged itself from fundamentals. And the BOJ is essentially just kind of

31:07 sticking to their party line that this is not something that they want to

31:11 control. They basically control interest rates

31:13 and monetary policy. And the affects is basically a function

31:16 for the Ministry of Finance. This currency has been bullied all

31:19 month. Mizuho are describing it as a dog

31:21 chasing an airborne Frisbee, which made me laugh at least this morning.

31:24 Mark looking at the direction of travel over the last month or so.

31:27 I want to know whether you believe we've actually put a sustainable ceiling now

31:31 in this currency pair on dollar yen. And I want your opinion on this from

31:35 Kate cheeks of silk, Jan, who said basically what we need to achieve that

31:38 is more aggressive policy action from both the Ministry of Finance and from

31:42 the DOJ. And the DOJ would need to signal a

31:45 willingness to normalize policy even further, which so far, Marcus, you know,

31:49 they've been reluctant to do so. So do you think we've established a

31:52 pretty durable, solid, resilient ceiling on dollar and around 660?

31:58 I think we have in part on the fact that what intervention does is it doesn't

32:02 change the trend. It changes the psychology.

32:05 So, you know, typically we could see is at least two weeks of this intervention

32:09 working. I would say what we need on the other

32:12 side is we do need to see the the trajectory of the dollar change.

32:15 We do need to see the fundamentals in us change.

32:17 I don't think that's going to change in favor of a stronger again in the short

32:20 term. But as you mentioned, the BOJ does have

32:23 an impact. And I think part of what if we go back

32:26 to like every major central bank when they started normalizing policy over the

32:29 last couple of years, everyone chronically underestimated what the

32:33 terminal rate was. And I think this was a part of it.

32:36 It's price discovery. We're in a new world.

32:39 Central banks are essentially their forward guidance and their their

32:42 forecasts themselves have not been able to articulate exactly where they think

32:46 the terminal rate should be either. So it's bad.

32:48 Basically, you know, the market has basically been forced to kind of go

32:51 through this process of figuring it out through trial and error.

32:54 And I think basically what we should think about is that the BOJ and the

32:57 Japan policy rate, the natural policy rate, is much higher than what's being

33:03 priced in the markets. If you look at one year, one year

33:05 Japanese basis price swap for basically around 50 basis points.

33:09 I would argue it's much higher than that.

33:10 It's probably above one. So I think at some point whether or not

33:14 it's because of the currency or whether or not just because, you know, the level

33:18 was priced in the market and where inflation is a bit more sticky in Japan,

33:22 you know, if you look at some of the stuff, this dropped out of the inflation

33:24 basket in Tokyo and some of the other indicators you track in Japan, they're

33:28 more temporary. They're related to fiscal stimulus

33:31 that's come through it. They've come through on subsidies.

33:34 So but the level of inflation in Japan is generally pretty higher.

33:38 So I would argue here that the BOJ is going to be forced to tighten more

33:42 aggressively. It was priced in the market that will

33:44 help stabilize the yen. But for the process to turn lower, you

33:49 just need a much more dovish Fed, which looks increasingly unlikely, at least

33:53 for the remainder of this year. Well, Mark, that's what I want to ask.

33:56 If short term the US dollar is not going anywhere.

33:59 Well, the BOJ, the financial chiefs and the currency chiefs in Japan just be

34:04 dealing with this episode again. Well, I think a big component here is if

34:09 you think about what drives dollar yen. I think there's two factors right now

34:13 that we could kind of see in some of the models and data we track.

34:15 It's hedge funds because there's a trade in it and it's Japanese institutional

34:20 investors. So I think a big piece of it is the

34:23 market wants to see institutional investors kind of front run movements in

34:27 policy. And I would argue that they are lagging

34:30 indicator. So if you think about pension funds,

34:32 insurance companies, even corporations, you know, essentially these are probably

34:36 some of the the institutions that are caught on the wrong side of this trade.

34:40 I think a lot of these places, we're probably thinking between one 4145,

34:44 that's topping dollar yen. So a lot of these institutions were

34:47 probably essentially short dollars, long yen.

34:50 And basically the move to 160 just was too much too fast.

34:53 So that's where we start to see the shoulder taps.

34:55 But I think in terms of the movements in dollar yen over the longer term, the

34:59 pension fund, rebalancing the insurance companies, all these these institutions

35:04 that are really running low on hedge levels.

35:07 And again, these are the ones that will start to repatriate that capital.

35:11 Yes, you need some movements coming from the Fed and from the US curve.

35:15 But essentially at the same time, you also, if you have BOJ tightening policy

35:18 a little bit more aggressively than what's markets are pricing, we will see

35:21 the repatriation of those flows over time, which is our expectations, but

35:25 that's not going to be the short term trade.

35:27 That is a process of how they look at an investment which those rebalancing

35:31 usually come quarterly or even annual. If you are just joining us, big moves

35:34 overnight, the ASX market allow me to run through them for you.

35:37 We brought 316 day late last night until the end.

35:40 This mark has just been pulling in the Japanese yen, pushing it ever higher

35:43 over the last month or so. Some big numbers taken out, numbers we

35:46 haven't seen since the early 1990s. That range this morning one 6017 at the

35:52 high, then the low one 5454 Japanese yen kicking in some strength big time in the

35:58 last few hours or so and a lot of suspicion that the Ministry of Finance

36:02 has intervened in this market. The official comment from them so far is

36:05 no comment. This from Dow Jones that financial

36:08 authorities have intervened in the market.

36:11 Mark, I want to wrap things up more broadly in foreign exchange.

36:14 This came from Eric Robertson of Stanchart.

36:16 He said this for AM. The combination of weaker currencies and

36:19 stronger commodity prices you alluded to that is creating a major dilemma that

36:23 could put rate cuts on hold indefinitely.

36:25 Mark, how do you think this story at the moment pair what's happening with the US

36:29 dollar, with what's happening with commodities?

36:31 How does it shape central bank decisions worldwide?

36:35 Yeah, it's absolutely critical. It's a very strong point there.

36:37 There's there's a way to think about it, right.

36:39 If you have strong growth and strong growth is leading to central bank

36:42 changes, that has one way of thinking, the affects market, if it's strong

36:46 growth and generally contained disinflation, that is bearish for the

36:50 dollar and that's where the commodity kicks in.

36:53 You get a turn to trade shock. That's good for em, especially in the

36:56 context that they have really high level of interest rates in terms of carry.

36:59 What we've seen recently, though, this is how it changes the market.

37:02 These are policy shocks, and the policy shocks driven by inflation is what

37:07 causes rate differentials to matter a lot.

37:09 So I think you could see this last week, Bank of Indonesia surprised markets by

37:13 hiking rates. No one was expecting that.

37:15 And we are now dealing with the policy trade off for G10 and emerging markets.

37:20 Central banks that have the Fed is basically priced to the point where they

37:23 can cut once or cut, not cut at all, or even depending on who wins the election,

37:27 whether or not they actually have to hike next year.

37:29 What we're seeing is these policy shocks are usually risk off.

37:33 Good for the dollar. I think in the context of commodities,

37:35 there's some cushion for the commodity exporters like Brazil and some of the

37:39 other countries around the world, but it's very small and it's going to be

37:43 marginal in terms of the context of whether or not these policy shocks

37:46 driven by US inflation, which is starting to accelerate relative to other

37:50 currencies that we track and is more bullish for the dollar, that's going to

37:54 force central banks that were had the ability to cut to change their

37:58 perspective. And that changing of perspective is what

38:00 tightens financial conditions, and it's what changes the growth outlook for the

38:04 next 6 to 12 months, which can be mutually reinforcing and negative for

38:09 risk and strong for the dollar. Hey, Mark, this is great.

38:11 Just fantastic to get your view on events overnight.

38:13 Matt McCormick, that of TD Securities rate cuts a luxury that many central

38:17 banks do not have right now. Equity futures positive by 0.2%, let's

38:21 get you up to speed on stories elsewhere.

38:23 Here is your impact Brief with Dani Burger.

38:24 Hey, Danny. Hey, John.

38:26 China's President Xi will visit the European Union for the first time in

38:29 five years. Next week she is going to visit France

38:33 as well as Hungary and nonmember Serbia. It'll be a six day trip.

38:37 There are visible tensions right now between Europe and China for things like

38:40 trade and spying allegations. But perhaps top of those tensions is

38:44 Beijing's support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

38:47 Beijing is pushing to repair relations with the EU, while leaders there have

38:51 become more assertive in responding to China's trade policies.

38:55 Senators are dismissing House Speaker Mike Johnson's call to send the National

38:59 Guard to college campuses. Johnson visited Columbia University last

39:03 week. He condemned pro-Palestinian protests

39:06 and said. There that that would be, quote,

39:08 appropriate for the National Guard if demonstrations were not contained.

39:12 Both Republican and Democratic senators have dismissed the idea.

39:15 J.D. Vance of Ohio said maybe just call the

39:18 police. While Tim Kaine of Virginia calls it a

39:20 very, very bad idea, Apple, yet again facing antitrust headwinds in Europe.

39:27 This time it's the iPad. It's going to be added to a list of

39:29 products that fall under the EU's Digital Market Act.

39:32 Now, Apple has six months to comply with a whole set of new obligations and

39:36 prohibitions. It's things like allowing the iPad users

39:39 to download apps outside of Apple Store. It is a clear loss for Apple, but it

39:44 also underscores the willingness of EU officials to go after big tech already

39:48 having taken aim at Microsoft Alphabet, Amazon and Bytedance.

39:53 That's your brief. John Downey, thank you.

39:55 We'll catch up with Downey in about 30 minutes time.

39:57 Up next on the program, the Fed's change in tone is both a story here about the

40:02 economy holding up very well with high interest rates as well as inflation.

40:05 Fresh is being persistent. Think the case for Fed easing here is

40:08 pretty is pretty small anytime soon. The Federal Reserve decision two days

40:13 away. That conversation up next.

40:29 Equities positive here by 0.2% on the S&P 500.

40:33 A lift, again, adding some weight to the rally from last week.

40:36 Yields are lower. That's helping.

40:38 Things were down four basis points on a ten year for 6218 under Savannah this

40:43 morning. The fed's change in tone that is both

40:46 the story here about the economy holding up very well with high interest rates as

40:51 well as inflation pressures being persistent.

40:53 I think the case for fed easing here is pretty is pretty small.

40:56 Any time soon we'll see what we are six months from now.

40:59 But certainly the Fed's going to have to change its tune about its its view that

41:03 there's a fair amount of easing that's coming down the road is the latest this

41:06 morning. Sticky inflation data reinforcing the

41:09 high for longer narratives as the Fed kicks off a two day meeting tomorrow.

41:13 JP Price and Wells Fargo write in their stop that inflation and resilient

41:16 economic activity through the first few months of the year have left the FOMC

41:20 little reason to ease policy in the near-term.

41:23 We can only expect the FOMC to first cut the Fed funds target rate by 25 basis

41:28 points at its September meeting. Jay Bryson joins us now for more.

41:32 So Jay, before we get into the Fed call, I want to talk about the data from last

41:35 week. For all the talk of US exceptionalism

41:38 over the rest of the world, how how exceptional was the first quarter in US

41:42 growth? Well, I mean, the US clearly grew faster

41:47 than the rest of the world in the first quarter.

41:49 Now we grew 1.6% annualized. I would say it was actually stronger

41:53 than that. A lot of that drag was from inventories

41:56 and imports. And, you know, imports show that

41:58 domestic demand is actually pretty strong here.

42:00 But if you look around, you know, the rest of the world, you're maybe you're

42:04 eking out positive growth rates, you know, in the EU, maybe get to eke out a

42:08 positive growth rate in the United Kingdom.

42:10 But, you know, in general, the US is outpacing its major trading partners at

42:15 this point. You kind of alluded to it.

42:16 Just how compatible was that downside surprise on GDP with the rest of the

42:20 data we had for the first quarter? Yeah.

42:23 So, you know, again, it comes down to two inventories.

42:26 There was a fairly large inventory drag. It sliced off about a full percentage

42:30 point. And if you look at net exports, that was

42:32 also close to two a half of a percentage point as well.

42:35 And and so if, you know, you dig down a little bit further, consumer spending

42:38 grew two and a half percent. That's a solid growth rate.

42:41 We eked out a positive growth rate in terms of fixed investment spending as

42:45 well. So if you look at the underlying core of

42:47 the US economy right now, growth in those main drivers of GDP growth is

42:52 pretty strong. Let's dig into your Fed call and the

42:55 month the month jumps off the pace for May, September.

42:58 We've had a lot of characters around this table who have said September's not

43:01 doable because it's too close to the election.

43:03 Why are you running with September? So so first of all, so, John, what I

43:08 would say is the risk to that view of September are probably skewed to the to

43:12 the back side right after, you know, towards the end of the year.

43:15 I certainly acknowledge that. But between now and then, you will get

43:19 three PC prints, you'll get three more non-farm payroll prints as well.

43:25 You know, could they raise cut rates in September?

43:28 If things are slowing down enough, then, yes.

43:31 You know, does does does the election just freeze September?

43:34 No, The Fed would prefer not to be moving in September.

43:38 But if you do see, you know, a significant deceleration in the economy,

43:41 if you do see the three month annualized rate of inflation coming back down to

43:45 two and a half, 2%, you could potentially see a rate cut in September.

43:50 So this is Laurie, one question for you on your September call is what really

43:53 gives you the confidence that the inflation data is going to cooperate by

43:57 September to give the Fed permission to go ahead and cut?

43:59 And I would say, number two, when you're thinking about, you know, the potential

44:02 for the hike conversation to come back in, how bad do you think the inflation

44:05 data would have to be for that conversation to pick back up in markets

44:09 again? Yeah.

44:10 So, Laura, let's take the second question first.

44:12 I mean, I think what you would need to see for, you know, the rate hikes to

44:16 come back onto the table, I think you would need to see a string, a continued

44:19 string of .3.4 in terms of the month on month change in the core PC that would

44:26 show you that inflation is just not coming back down to the 2% sort of

44:30 target that the Fed is looking for. And I think that's what you kind of need

44:34 to see that now. So what are we going to do?

44:36 What are we looking for going forward? So we do think that, you know, if the

44:40 data would show this, that if you look at housing prices, housing prices

44:44 continue to decelerate, at least in terms of, you know, what you're actually

44:48 seeing out there in the real market in terms of rents, we think that will come

44:52 down. The labor market is also getting into

44:54 better balance in terms of supply and demand.

44:56 The quit rate is back below where it was before the pandemic.

45:01 The vacancy rate is also coming back down to where it was before the

45:04 pandemic. And so as the labor market gets into

45:07 better balance, that should slow the rate of wage growth.

45:11 And then that brings back down the super core rate of inflation.

45:15 So that's kind of what we're looking for in terms of, you know, the Fed easing

45:18 later this year. Joe, you say that the election doesn't

45:22 make September on a manageable, but what about November?

45:26 Could they the day after, two days after the election come out and do something

45:30 in November? Yeah.

45:32 And so, you know, that's that's again, that's kind of tricky, right?

45:34 If they're if they are on pause in September, they're going to get a lot of

45:38 pushback from one side. And then if they go ahead and two days

45:41 after the election, they're cutting rates, they're going to get a lot of

45:44 pushback for saying, oh, these guys just, you know, held rates in September,

45:48 you know, to help one on one side here. So the election does does complicate

45:54 things for them. But if you go back and you look at, you

45:56 know, in other election years, they have moved before, right.

46:00 You're right on the eve of an election. So it doesn't it doesn't rule it out.

46:04 It complicates their their messaging. It complicates what they're trying to

46:07 do. But it doesn't necessarily rule out a

46:10 rate move in September. Just on the politics, the report from

46:13 The Wall Street Journal last week that the former president and the team around

46:17 him reportedly are considering how to be a little bit more assertive around

46:21 central bank decisions in the Federal Reserve and being diplomatic.

46:24 I just wonder what your response to that actually was.

46:27 Do you know how that would work in practice?

46:30 So, you know, so I guess I don't really fully understand

46:34 the question, John, But I guess what, you know, what you're alluding to here

46:37 is I think there will potentially be more political pressure on the Fed if

46:42 former the former president is re-elected.

46:45 You know, he put some political pressure on the Fed before and you could you

46:49 could imagine that going forward as well.

46:51 You answered the question in the spirit in which it was intended, Jay.

46:53 Thank you, sir. Jay Bryson of West Fargo, appreciate it.

46:56 Following that Wall Street Journal report just last week.

46:59 Major, what did you make of that? Well, let's go to where Terry Haines had

47:01 to say over the weekend. He came out with a note saying, quote,

47:04 Forget about it, because when it comes to the central bank, the Fed monetary

47:10 policy is Congress's job to mandate and to give that to the central bank to look

47:15 at their dual mandate has nothing to do with the president.

47:17 But of course, when you look at potentially who's going to be around the

47:21 president, you can have some sort of initiatives that would potentially make

47:25 it a dollarization path forward. They want a weak dollar in terms of

47:30 exports, but nothing, at least a Terry Haynes says that Congress and the courts

47:34 are going to be able to do to give that authority to the president.

47:37 I'm guessing Jay knew exactly what I meant.

47:40 Emory mentioned a little bit earlier in the program, should the Fed be guided by

47:43 the economic data or guided by the communication we're getting from

47:46 corporate America? Larry, can we finish on this quote from

47:48 Wal-Mart? At Wal-Mart, we're now seeing prices

47:51 that are in line with where they were 12 months ago.

47:54 I haven't been able to say that for a few years now.

47:56 That's an executive speaking to ABC. We've heard echoes of that coming out of

47:59 the company, which I think we are learning from corporate America.

48:02 So I do feel like the inflation commentary is a little less hot than

48:06 what it was in the last reporting season.

48:07 And that's a good sign, right? We still we're not even halfway through

48:11 this thing yet, Right. So we've got to see what comes out in

48:13 the next few weeks. But I do feel like it's just a more

48:15 mixed, more nuanced conversation. You know, I think companies last quarter

48:20 seemed to really do a good job of keeping expectations in line and talking

48:23 things down. I'm not noticing that this time around.

48:26 And we've actually seen S&P EPS, the bottom up consensus has moved up two

48:30 bucks. So we'll see if that continues.

48:32 But I feel like they've done a good job the last year or so clamping down on

48:35 expectations and the setup is actually pretty decent.

48:38 Big, big story later this week on the earnings front.

48:40 Amazon coming up tomorrow, Apple on Thursday.

48:42 Larry, love this. It's good to see you.

48:43 Thanks for having us. Have been with us for the hour.

48:44 Lori can have a say to that. RBC Capital Markets set up the second

48:48 hour of Bloomberg Surveillance. Joining us for the next 60 minutes will

48:50 catch up with Jay Pilarski of two VW blimp has blimps her down the latest

48:54 with Tesla. Some thoughts.

48:55 I have maxim Group looking ahead to earnings this week including Amazon

48:58 tomorrow and we'll catch up with the prediction out of sight of Franklin

49:02 Templeton on this bond market going into payrolls and the Federal Reserve equity

49:06 futures positive here by 0.2% on the S&P bond yields are lower by four basis

49:11 points on a ten year for 6226. Live from New york City, this is

49:16 Bloomberg.

49:33 The stocks are starting to get a little flashy.

49:36 We like them more. A few months ago, when they were a bit

49:38 more humble. We think that valuations are fair for

49:41 the S&P to work as we go through the rest of the year.

49:44 We need to continue to deliver on earnings growth.

49:46 The risk for equities now is less about earnings and more about valuations.

49:51 We certainly see more value in being able to find opportunities in the US.

49:54 There's been a lot of good news priced into a lot of the big tech companies.

49:57 This is a chance to really kind of show me what is the rest of 2024 look like

50:01 and then we can go from there. This is Bloomberg Surveillance with

50:05 Jonathan Ferro, Lisa Abramowitz and Annmarie Horden BURNETT.

50:09 Two more trading days left before we kick off make, whereas this year in

50:13 April, it's been absolutely bruising. So we close out last week in the

50:17 headline Run's Biggest weekly Gain on the S&P 500 of the year so far.

50:21 And I remember the headline from the week before, which was the biggest

50:24 weekly loss on the S&P 500 of the year. So far we have been absolutely

50:28 everywhere and we'll be everywhere this week as well.

50:30 We've got earnings data and a big Federal Reserve decision.

50:33 Here's your week ahead. It looks a little something like this.

50:36 The Amazon story kicks off after the closing bell tomorrow, Wednesday,

50:40 Federal Reserve rate decision. Apple earnings come in on Thursday.

50:43 Lots of trouble, down double digits through most of this year.

50:46 Big problems in China. We'll be talking about them in just a

50:48 moment. Friday, the payrolls report, the meeting

50:51 estimate in our survey so far, 250,000, if you want to kick it off with this

50:55 market this morning. Before we get to all of those events, we

50:58 need to talk about not the equity market, not the bond market.

51:02 We need to talk about foreign exchange in this currency pound right here,

51:05 dollar yen overnight, all over the place.

51:08 So let me give you the range high. The session one 6017 low of the session

51:12 one 5454 Current price 155 This is the official line from the Ministry of

51:19 Finance. No comment.

51:20 That's the official line. This is the story coming from Dow Jones.

51:24 Japan's financial authorities intervened in the market.

51:28 So we had a public holiday. Low liquidity yen's been bullied all

51:31 month and it looks like based on reports that the Ministry of Finance stepped in,

51:35 Will try and get some more details on that throughout this morning.

51:38 If you want to know where the price action is in the equity market, equity

51:40 futures adding some weight to last week's rally, up by 0.2% on the S&P 500.

51:45 A little bit of a lift there in the bond market, yield to lower by four basis

51:48 points on a ten year for 62 on a two year wait down two basis points at about

51:52 498 outside of the yen. And effects on the euro were firmer here

51:57 107 €16 dollar positive by 2/10 of 1%. Coming up this hour, we'll catch up with

52:03 WS J. Polaski on why the dollar could be ripe

52:05 for a selloff. Tom Forte of Maxim Group previewing

52:08 earnings from Amazon and Apple and sound design Franklin Templeton on why this

52:13 will be a, quote, short and shallow rate cutting cycle.

52:16 We begin with our top story. Kicking off a week of jam packed data, a

52:20 fed decision, some big tech earnings as well and a US jobs report to wash it all

52:24 down. Jay polaski, a tpi w advisory, writes in

52:27 this We remain constructive on the fundamentals for the US and global

52:30 economy. We aren't developing a line of thinking

52:32 on the dollar. This suggests it could be ripe for a

52:35 momentum selloff. Jason with us for the gap joins the

52:38 roundtable. Chaikin money tier one.

52:40 John, let's start there. That smells like peak us exceptionalism.

52:44 To me that call. Is that what they says?

52:45 Well, it's kind of like that, John, right.

52:47 I mean, you read about the wrecking ball of the dollar and you read about how

52:50 strong the dollar has been. And yet the reality is that over the

52:55 last six months, the dollar was actually down 1%.

52:58 The why you look over the over the last year, the dollar's up less than 4%.

53:03 So the dollar again, is a one off situation.

53:06 Right. It's the extreme because it's the most

53:09 extreme interest rate differential right rates.

53:11 And in Japan, there's virtually zero rates in the US 5%.

53:16 Obviously, that's where people are going to play the game.

53:19 And so the rest of the world, that's nowhere near as extreme as that.

53:23 And our our view is that the rest of the world is starting to recover.

53:27 The US has already had its peak exceptionalism, right?

53:30 It was last year. This year, going forward, the rest of

53:33 the world recovers. China is growing at 5%.

53:36 Europe is actually escaping recession, Japan is doing well and therefore we

53:41 think why big tech right? There was that momentum run.

53:45 They all ran the Magnificent Seven, then they rolled over very hard and very

53:50 fast. Nvidia down 20% in less than a month.

53:54 Okay, the poster child for AI. So for us, the dollar is ripe for a sell

53:59 off. You have the longest speculative

54:02 position in five years in the dollar. Biggest short, biggest long position in

54:07 five years. You have the ECB getting ready to cut

54:10 rates, the Fed not ready to cut rates. And what we're looking for is kind of

54:15 like the catalyst, right? What's going to be the the tell, what's

54:18 going to be the signal? We're setting the story up with that

54:20 comment we wrote on Friday. The tell could be the ECB cuts.

54:25 And instead of the euro falling, it rallies.

54:28 It rallies. And that suggests growth.

54:30 And therefore and we think then the dollar could.

54:33 All over it quite hard and hit a couple of technical levels.

54:36 And instead of talking about 106 to the dollar and why it could break one and

54:42 therefore break 100, and therefore that could be significant for us because

54:48 we're long emerging markets, we're long commodities, and a weak dollar is very

54:53 supportive of both of those assets. Lots to unpack there.

54:56 Let's start with Europe. I'm seeing echoes of that in the sense

54:58 that research this morning, particularly from Jp morgan and Mislav MOTSYK,

55:01 Russia, this quite with each day we continue to see an improved relative

55:04 risk reward for eurozone equities versus the U.S.

55:07 even in the event of further market weakness and would look to have as the

55:11 next step an upgrade of eurozone versus the US to an outright overweight.

55:16 So people are starting to pay attention to this theme.

55:18 What was it that we learned from the downdraft in the last month about what

55:22 was happening elsewhere and just how well priced the negativity already is?

55:26 Well, certainly when we think about that, we look to China.

55:29 Right. And China has been the epicenter of

55:31 negativity right on investable. We've talked about it on the show

55:34 before. Right.

55:35 What the pro-tip when you hear when you hear an investable, you go long.

55:40 And so China to us is the real opportunity and we've talked about that

55:44 through things like web and elsewhere. But when you think about Europe, what's

55:49 interesting to us is that people always make this mistake.

55:53 They focus on GDP and not earnings. Stocks move off of earnings, not GDP.

55:59 If they moved off GDP, China would be the best performing market in the world

56:03 because it's been the fastest growing economy.

56:05 And that's absolutely not been the case. So in Europe, you know, companies are

56:10 doing well. A big part of Europe's equity market

56:13 actually generates its revenue and profits from outside of Europe.

56:17 And so to us, the opportunity is in Europe for long there.

56:21 The European banks, John, you and I have gone back for years.

56:24 They're massive but but they've been massive outperformers here, Massive

56:28 outperformers. And so you got to you know, you've got

56:30 to recognize that European banks, Japan, China, emerging markets, you know, to us

56:37 there's a lot of opportunity in the world.

56:39 You say go long China, but for how long? Well, I think China has the best risk

56:44 reward of any of the markets out there. Right.

56:47 It all the negativity is priced in. None of the upside is priced in.

56:51 K Web's a perfect example, right? The e-commerce market in China is two

56:55 times the size of United States. It's growing at 15% per annum.

56:59 The stocks are trading at a 40% discount to the US equivalents.

57:04 K web could double from 26. Now it's 28.

57:08 When we were on last it was 25, 28 to 50, whatever, and then double again to

57:14 over 100. The 2021 high for K web was $102.

57:19 It's at 28. It could it could, as I said, could

57:23 double and double again. So the upside I think is absolutely

57:26 dramatic. So US tech firms are having some

57:28 difficulty at the moment in China. Up until this morning, Tesla was one of

57:31 those Apple, was it not? That I want to talk about your original

57:34 take. I think of what is happening for Chinese

57:36 firms in China. You're basically saying they've got the

57:39 whole market to dominate themselves. Is that starting to work?

57:41 I love the job when you remember it better than I do.

57:44 Ha ha ha. That's my story.

57:46 And you remember it better than me. Thank you very much.

57:49 I had a chance to look at my notes, but yes, absolutely right.

57:51 We call it the two tech stack divide, right?

57:54 Basically, the US and China are walling off their tech stacks from each other,

57:59 and people have focused on that as a negative for Chinese stocks because

58:03 they're not going to be able to participate here.

58:05 They haven't yet cottoned on to the reality that that means China companies

58:09 will dominate that e-commerce market we just talked about, which is growing.

58:12 It's twice as big as the United States growing at 15% per annum.

58:17 It's going to be only available to Chinese companies.

58:19 And Apple is the US poster child of what that means for US companies because

58:24 Apple is very dependent on China. So if it's positive for Chinese firms,

58:27 is it negative for us? Exactly.

58:29 There you go. Yes.

58:30 China, the biggest growth story in the world, in the biggest, fastest growing

58:35 region of the world, which is Southeast Asia, which China is increasingly moving

58:38 to kind of dominate economically. U.S.

58:41 companies are going to have much less of an area of opportunity there, mining and

58:46 commodities. We need to talk about that as well.

58:47 And copper specifically. So BHP wants a piece of Anglo.

58:50 We know why and it's not the diamonds that we said on the program last week.

58:53 The new diamonds, it's copper. What does that tell you about the future

58:56 here in this trade and the amount of copper that we need and how you want to

58:59 get exposure to this through ten K last week on the animation.

59:02 Yeah. We've been long copper very bullish

59:04 we've been very bullish commodities. We have a double overweight commodities

59:08 in our global multi-asset flagship model portfolio and we play it through copper,

59:14 which is the copper ETF and it's been a monster and it's breaking out and I

59:18 think it will continue to do very well because, look, the another theme that

59:23 we're starting to develop, there's just so much going on.

59:25 So Rich, an opportunity to talk about things is an investment age, right?

59:31 And one of the ages is. I write.

59:33 You look at the spending alphabet in Microsoft last week, right?

59:37 45 billion each on AI. The other is on the whole infrastructure

59:42 in clean energy and renewable and electric vehicles, and that is copper

59:47 and that is commodities. And so to us, that investment age that

59:52 we see rolling out really supports our kind of multi-year positive view.

59:57 Right. We we have a view that 2023 to 2027 is

01:00:02 going to be a blue sky global macro period.

01:00:05 And this investment build out that we're hearing from companies is really going

01:00:10 to underpin that and supports that. So that makes us more bullish and it

01:00:13 makes us want to be long. The pick and shovel of AI, which we've

01:00:17 talked about semis, right, and long commodities, physical commodities for

01:00:23 the build out. And so it's really semi's in copper.

01:00:26 I want to talk about the actual physical picks and shovels.

01:00:29 You touched on it just then, and I want to talk about the last 15 years and

01:00:32 metals and mining, which you know well, but it's worth going over again.

01:00:35 So we come out of GFC, China is booming, so everyone takes a hole and they keep

01:00:39 digging holes and you give a dollar to a miner, it takes the hole deeper.

01:00:41 We see that repeatedly. Then comes the bust with that's a big

01:00:44 deal. So I was thinking back to Xstrata and

01:00:46 Glencore monster deals, everything starts to move south and they become

01:00:50 really, really reluctant to invest. And I remember Jean-sebastien Jacques of

01:00:55 Rio used to catch up with them. Often the former CEO would come on the

01:00:58 program and he would say, Look, now is the time for value over volume.

01:01:02 So these guys haven't been built in the mines.

01:01:04 They've been reluctant to for a long, long time.

01:01:06 Are we going to move back into that stage where you give a miner a dollar,

01:01:09 they dig a hole, or they're actually going to be really reluctant to do so

01:01:12 from here? Well, I think there's going to be some

01:01:13 of that. And you're seeing the consolidation

01:01:16 first, and then those winners are going to make the decisions on where to put

01:01:20 build the hole or dig a hole. But I mean, to us, it's a supply and

01:01:24 demand, right? You're touching on the supply side,

01:01:26 right? Their supply side is constrained because

01:01:29 there hasn't been investment in mining for a decade.

01:01:33 And these are not projects that you turn on as you know very well.

01:01:36 Right. You don't turn them on in a week.

01:01:38 Yeah. Years takes years from from planning to

01:01:41 implementation to then providing supply. So that's the supply side.

01:01:45 And then you have the demand side where copper demand and demand for other

01:01:50 metals and minerals is growing dramatically, in part because of

01:01:54 reshaping the entire energy system of the globe.

01:02:00 And so these two things together we think are massive.

01:02:03 And you know, you've had interesting shakeout.

01:02:06 So you talk about the shakeout in the mining, right?

01:02:08 Yeah. The other side, we're having the

01:02:09 shakeout on the clean energy side and the renewable side, right.

01:02:12 With the Evija. You've touched on Tesla.

01:02:14 It's been, you know, oh my God, the solar companies, the wind companies

01:02:18 there, we're in that space because our other model was a thematic model, right?

01:02:22 Our TI BW 20 is thematic. So future tech and climate are the two

01:02:26 big drivers there. And that's that climate segment has been

01:02:29 really, really tough the last couple of years, in part because of the interest

01:02:33 rate structure, etc.. So that also could start to pick up

01:02:37 pretty significantly at a time when supply is constrained and we know what

01:02:41 happens, right? What makes it what brings the two

01:02:44 together, price, price. And so for us, we think that, you know,

01:02:49 10,000 on copper is not the end of the story.

01:02:52 Okay. This morning they make up another three

01:02:54 quarters of 1% is going to be sticking with us through the next hour or so.

01:02:58 Let's give an update on stories as to where we can do that with the Bloomberg

01:03:00 brief. Let's get to Dani Burger for more.

01:03:02 Hey, Danny. Hey, John.

01:03:03 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Saudi Arabia this morning.

01:03:07 It's his first stop on another round of visits in the Middle East.

01:03:10 In it, the US is expected to push for a truce in Gaza in exchange for the

01:03:14 release of hostages. An Israeli official says that if a deal

01:03:18 is reached, the country will hold off an invasion of Rafah.

01:03:21 Blinken is expected to meet with representatives of Qatar, Egypt, the UAE

01:03:25 and Jordan, while in Riyadh, and then he heads to Israel and Jordan.

01:03:29 Apple facing more antitrust headwinds in Europe.

01:03:33 Now, the iPad has been added to a list of products that fall under the EU's

01:03:36 Digital Market Act. It means that Apple has six months to

01:03:39 comply with a whole set of new obligations and prohibitions.

01:03:43 Things like allowing iPad users to download apps outside of Apple Store.

01:03:47 It is a clear loss for Apple, but it also underscores the willingness of EU

01:03:51 officials to go after big tech, Saxo told me earlier this morning.

01:03:55 It's not clear that the sector can outperform now with the growing

01:03:58 scrutiny. It's been a tough go for McKinsey

01:04:01 employees after the firm cut hundreds of jobs and warned thousands more that

01:04:05 their performance needs improvement. But at an event with fellow partners in

01:04:10 mid April, global managing partner Bob Sternfeld said now is a quote, turn the

01:04:15 page moment. According to sources, the event was held

01:04:17 in Copenhagen and it was dotted with upbeat declarations.

01:04:21 The best part was probably the musical soundtrack and included songs by Eminem

01:04:25 and Bob Marley and Tub thumping by Chumbawamba.

01:04:28 I'm not sure what's more motivational than that.

01:04:30 John. Danny, appreciate it.

01:04:32 We all needed that. Next on the program, a potential game

01:04:35 changer for Tesla. That conversation just around the

01:04:37 corner. That stock is higher by almost 10% in

01:04:40 the free market. From New York this morning.

01:04:43 Good morning.

01:04:55 Wednesday, the Fed decided Jay Powell pumping the brakes on rate hikes are off

01:05:00 the table. No cuts.

01:05:02 Looking perhaps a little bit more likely.

01:05:04 You can't say there's a whole lot wrong with the US economy.

01:05:07 Trust Bloomberg to bring you the fastest coverage and exclusive analysis,

01:05:11 including Powell's press conference. Policy rate is likely at its peak

01:05:14 threshold to cut rates is a little higher.

01:05:17 Redefining Patience Bloomberg Surveillance.

01:05:19 The Fed decides starting at 1:30 p.m. Eastern, context changes everything.

01:05:31 This is what it's all about. A week full of us and risk.

01:05:35 Grandma is back with us tomorrow morning.

01:05:36 Hopefully his voice joins us in the next couple of days.

01:05:39 Equity featured positive by 0.1% on the S&P 500.

01:05:43 You like that? You can't say it didn't.

01:05:44 You can't speak. We're down four basis points up ten for

01:05:47 6239 disadvantage this morning a potential game changer for Tesla I think

01:05:54 long term China there's definitely a push inside China to pursue national

01:05:59 brands. Apple is feeling that and that's Nike is

01:06:02 feeling that and Tesla ultimately will will will feel that as well.

01:06:05 I don't think Tesla will be a top three or potentially even a top four brand in

01:06:10 the future and in China. So but for now, Musk is playing this

01:06:14 game in the short run. And let's see how how things develop

01:06:17 from here. Here's the latest this morning.

01:06:18 Shares of Tesla driving higher as Elon Musk's surprise visit to China appears

01:06:22 to pay off. Bloomberg reporting Tesla will partner

01:06:24 with Chinese tech giant Baidu for mapping and navigation functions to

01:06:28 support its full self-driving Tesla, also passing a key data security and

01:06:33 privacy requirement, which could help the company take the software to its

01:06:36 cars in the Chinese market. Dan ISE of Wedbush joins us now for more

01:06:40 then. Appreciate you jumping on in front of

01:06:42 the camera for us to break this down. How big a deal do you think this could

01:06:44 be? And it's a watershed moment.

01:06:47 I mean, this is three years in the making that Tesla has been trying to get

01:06:51 into China from an FSD perspective. And this unlocks a golden opportunity

01:06:57 not just for Tesla in China, but I think globally.

01:07:01 It's a game changer, in my opinion. That's what I want to give you on.

01:07:04 Okay. Dan, so China is one thing.

01:07:06 What does it mean for the United States? And the same think.

01:07:10 Look, it's important because it's also a shot across the bow shows what's

01:07:14 happening in China and from a miles run perspective.

01:07:20 So from a data perspective, China, that's the golden goose.

01:07:24 So this is going to seriously advance has the from an FSD perspective.

01:07:29 And Musk knew that that's why he did this trip.

01:07:32 It was obviously a surprise one, and I think it's going to come as a surprise

01:07:36 in a good way to investors long time in the making.

01:07:40 It's a trophy case moment for Musk came back on that plane, come back from

01:07:45 Beijing. Hey, Dan, Jay Polaski here.

01:07:48 Really enjoy your work. When you say game changer and a global

01:07:52 game changer, what exactly do you mean? Is this the does this mean the robo taxi

01:07:57 is coming soon or does it accelerate that process?

01:08:00 I mean, what's really the the game changing nature of this particular move?

01:08:06 Yeah that's a great question. Autonomous FSD.

01:08:09 When you talk about the golden vision, it can happen without China.

01:08:14 Hmm. So this is a missing piece in the

01:08:16 puzzle. The fact that they got this clearance

01:08:18 from Beijing. It unlocks really now the whole vision.

01:08:23 And I think that's why it's important in terms of the longer term, what tests it

01:08:28 could achieve, not just in China, but globally when it comes to FSD.

01:08:31 And I think this is just the start. It's obviously a win for Baidu as well,

01:08:36 but it really shows. Now, finally, it's not just talk walking

01:08:40 the walk. This is I think it's a historical moment

01:08:43 for Tesla in its FSD efforts. And Dan, if I could just follow up a

01:08:47 little bit on that. We have a thesis that DPW advisory that

01:08:52 it's kind of we call it a two tech stack world where China and the U.S.

01:08:56 are kind of isolating their tech stacks. And that really creates a lot of

01:09:00 opportunity within China Tech. And I'm wondering how you think about

01:09:04 that. And you said this obviously benefits by

01:09:07 do as well. What about China Tech versus U.S.

01:09:12 tech? Look, I think right now US tech's ahead

01:09:15 of China when we talk about A.I.. I think what Tesla, they're trying to

01:09:18 thread the needle here. They're trying to take that technology

01:09:21 nearby to it stored in Shanghai to actually be able to use that globally.

01:09:26 And I think it just comes down to there's only two companies that need to

01:09:29 thread the needle in terms of China, US, it's Cook and Cupertino and it's Musk

01:09:35 and Tesla. And that's why this is a huge win for

01:09:38 Musk, even domestically for him just to come in there during the auto show, come

01:09:43 out, get FSD approval suddenly stress test out a little bit more apple.

01:09:48 China right now, not even a top tier smartphone player.

01:09:51 Dan, can we get into that a little bit more?

01:09:52 What Jay is making the point that he's making is that ultimately the Chinese

01:09:55 market will be dominated by Chinese brands, potentially leaves and likewise

01:10:00 in smartphones. Why is he wrong?

01:10:03 Because you make the best products in the world consumers are going to buy.

01:10:07 And that's why at the top of that mountain, the Mount Rushmore is Cook in

01:10:11 Cupertino. Now, there are clearly going to growth

01:10:14 headwinds now, but I believe six, 12 months now they're not.

01:10:17 I think we'll start to see that Thursday when they report.

01:10:20 Look, I think this starts betting against Apple in China has been the

01:10:25 wrong move and in our opinion is 220 million iPhones there, hundred 30

01:10:30 million have not upgrade in four plus years.

01:10:32 That growth opportunity will be on the horizon.

01:10:35 You say it's the wrong move, but that sure, it's been paid this year.

01:10:38 I've said that she before. We're down 12% year to date and China

01:10:41 has been a big feature of that line this morning.

01:10:43 Dan, by the way, I'll throw this out there.

01:10:44 This came from Penn State this morning. They say by the fire, they say Apple has

01:10:47 they rated significantly amid a weak iPhone 15 cycle, fears that Apple's

01:10:52 China business is structurally impaired. The taking the other side of it.

01:10:54 You mentioned the numbers on Thursday. What are you looking for, Dan?

01:10:58 Looking near-term, John, that that's been the right move.

01:11:01 Right, in terms of the short. But it's like betting against Brunson in

01:11:04 one game. That's going to be a bad maybe a good

01:11:07 move for one game for the long term. It's not.

01:11:09 And I think Thursday, it's really about Apple showing that growth as you go into

01:11:14 the June quarter, September what we're seeing in China that turnarounds there

01:11:18 and this all sets up for a permanent Cupertino and that's what I believe is

01:11:23 going to really be the massive drum roll over the coming months.

01:11:27 Hey, Dan, it's Jay again. What about the case for I opportunity in

01:11:32 China? Do you look at any of the Chinese

01:11:35 companies as you want to pair, like almost like a global pair trade?

01:11:39 You know, you have Apple, you have Tesla.

01:11:41 Okay. Those are the two U.S.

01:11:43 companies that are going to have an opportunity in China.

01:11:45 What about on the Chinese side? Yeah, I think Alibaba, in my opinion,

01:11:50 that's the play in China from a cloud perspective, everything they're doing.

01:11:55 And I think Shen, which was like a microsoft, Google, Amazon, what they're

01:11:59 doing on the cloud, I think that's in our opinion, the pie, the best China

01:12:03 cloud play when we look at Beijing. Dan Love it.

01:12:07 It's great to catch up soon. I doubt we'll catch up later this week

01:12:09 on into that big earnings report on Thursday then ouster of Wedbush.

01:12:13 So here's the argument that you'll make in Chinese market dominated by Chinese

01:12:17 firm argument that Dan Ives is making is that US firms make the best technology.

01:12:21 Consumers are going to buy it. Why is he wrong?

01:12:23 Well, I think China is trying to catch up.

01:12:25 He's not wrong today. Right.

01:12:26 Obviously that that's the case. I think the issue is, you know, we're

01:12:30 price for that is one right. He talked about Alibaba Alibaba trades

01:12:34 at eight times earnings eight okay. Apple even after the rating doesn't

01:12:38 trade anywhere close to eight times earnings.

01:12:40 So for one, you know you buy the the cheaper version that's going to go up

01:12:46 that curve because there's a national policy for Chinese companies to be

01:12:51 dominant players in this space. And he has been right about Apple being

01:12:56 able to thread the needle on China. I think that area, that opportunity is

01:13:00 getting narrower and narrower. And when China feels like it doesn't

01:13:04 need Apple to thread that needle, Apple's not going to be able to thread

01:13:09 that needle. And so for now, I'm buying the cheap

01:13:13 Alibaba play where has dramatic upside and thinking that over time it's going

01:13:19 to dominate more and more of that Chinese market.

01:13:21 J philosophy a t VW sticking with us. Coming up on the program, big tech

01:13:25 earnings continue this week for two companies with very different fortunes

01:13:29 so far this year. Tom Forte of Maxim Group joins us next

01:13:32 to preview Apple and Amazon equity futures.

01:13:35 Right now, an S&P just about positive by 0.2% in the bond market.

01:13:39 Your ten year yield at for 62 and for those of you until again watch three 160

01:13:45 and back down again one 5589.

01:13:59 Two days left in the month of April. Equity so far this morning up a quarter

01:14:03 of 1% on the S&P 500. The NASDAQ up by a third of 1% for the

01:14:07 month of April. We're heading for the worst month for

01:14:10 the S&P 500 since September. It's been a really choppy month, but

01:14:14 it's been a very aggressive rally since the end of October.

01:14:17 We're down this month by something like 3%.

01:14:19 And last week's big week of gains, the biggest week of the year so far

01:14:22 happened. Just chip away.

01:14:23 Take a bite out of those losses for April.

01:14:26 Let's see if we can do some more work for the next couple of days.

01:14:28 As they said, work in the bond market on a two year, ten year, two year, still

01:14:31 around 5% of 497, 47 down two basis points this morning, a ten year around

01:14:37 for 60 after breaking through for 70 just last week for 6197.

01:14:42 Down by four basis points. We've added a lot of weight to that

01:14:44 yield over the last few weeks in April so far.

01:14:48 Still up by more than 40 basis points on a ten year and up by something like 30

01:14:53 odd on a two year, something like 35 basis points through the month so far.

01:14:57 Well, that cement is a really strong, resilient US dollar through the year so

01:15:00 far. Well that's down to the Japanese yen is

01:15:03 absolutely crush it dollar yen three 160 earlier one 5591.

01:15:08 On that currency pair right now down by 1.5% and report from Dow Jones that

01:15:13 there was some intervention. We'll talk about that in just a moment.

01:15:16 And a Savannah this morning, a key week ahead for the US economy.

01:15:19 The Fed set to keep rates on hold on Wednesday with all eyes on Fed chair Jay

01:15:23 Powell news conference for clues on when and if the fed might cut rates this year

01:15:27 on friday. Is the jobs report your estimate?

01:15:30 250 k j 30 minutes. We haven't talked about the fed.

01:15:34 How good does that feel in a second guess this morning?

01:15:37 Honestly, we've worked through so many issues and have not talked about the

01:15:39 Federal Reserve. What does that tell you?

01:15:40 That tells me that, you know, it's not really that important, right?

01:15:44 The Fed is in the rearview mirror. We're focused on other things.

01:15:47 Whether they cut in September or November or December is not important.

01:15:52 We are willing to trade rate cuts for earnings growth, and that's the trade

01:15:57 that we're making. And earnings growth is accelerating and

01:16:00 stocks are going to be perfectly fine as long as that continues.

01:16:04 With last week evidence of that? Yes, indeed, it was exactly that.

01:16:07 And your point is evidence, right? We've we've raised base rates are at six

01:16:11 month highs in stocks are have powered ahead.

01:16:14 And yes, we've had a little pullback in April, but that's perfectly natural and

01:16:18 healthy. It's a feature, not a bug to have a

01:16:20 pullback every once in a while. Laurie Iverson of ABC joined us on the

01:16:24 program a little bit earlier, has a focus at times of small caps.

01:16:27 And she said this reminds her of the price action in small caps, the moves of

01:16:30 mega-cap stocks in America, and paid a share of academy securities.

01:16:34 Basically asking a simple question is 10% 31% for Mega-cap tech?

01:16:38 These swings, let's go through them. Jake, I did this earlier.

01:16:41 It's worth doing again. So they started with a video two Fridays

01:16:43 ago on nothing. 10% moves lower than we start last week.

01:16:47 We get Tesla numbers come out, we pop 10%, $500 billion name and then we get

01:16:53 numbers from matter. We dropped 10% on a $1 trillion name, $2

01:16:56 trillion net Google 10% move on Friday. What's that about?

01:17:00 I think it's a people all have the same kind of technical levels that they're

01:17:04 watching in market is really increasingly controlled by algorithmic

01:17:08 trading and so they levels and it's just in their pocket.

01:17:11 There's nothing there's no other side anymore.

01:17:14 Right? Everybody hits things at the same time.

01:17:16 And that's why you have this momentum trade and people are still confused

01:17:20 about really, where are we going with the economy, with the Fed, etc..

01:17:24 So it's very much a trend following market and momentum market.

01:17:29 And when that momentum ends, then everybody is like, boom, we're out of

01:17:32 here. And so to us, that's great.

01:17:35 That's healthy. We don't want things to go to the sky

01:17:38 because they never go to the sky. We like pullbacks and to us as long term

01:17:43 investors, we really think the opportunity is in things like some of

01:17:47 these tech names, the particularly the semis.

01:17:49 Right. Our our view is the age is real.

01:17:53 It's creating an investment age. I mean, the things that I took away from

01:17:57 last week was that Apple sorry, Google and Microsoft both said they were going

01:18:04 to spend $45 billion or more reward on a guy that's two companies, that's $90

01:18:11 billion. So to us, the semis are a no brainer for

01:18:16 just buy and hold and ride through these little, you know, mini blips is not a

01:18:21 problem. Yeah, the picks and shovels and shovels.

01:18:23 Okay. Okay.

01:18:24 You mentioned that a little bit earlier. Let's talk about air pockets and foreign

01:18:27 exchange. This one right here, We're talking about

01:18:29 levels in effects we haven't seen since the early 1990s, the weakening past 160

01:18:34 against the US dollar overnight, then rebounding really strongly.

01:18:37 Question What happened? Dow Jones reporting that financial

01:18:40 authorities intervened to support Japan's currency.

01:18:44 The country's top currency official saying he had, quote, no comment.

01:18:48 State policy, please comment. What's the signal you take from this

01:18:51 move? It's not important.

01:18:52 It really isn't. Well, look, I mean, the real story is

01:18:55 that here's a question. I'll toss it back to you.

01:18:58 Please do. What do you think fair value is on on

01:19:01 the yen? Absolutely no idea.

01:19:02 Yeah. Under 100.

01:19:04 That's what you think. Fabulous.

01:19:05 Not. Not, not.

01:19:06 Maybe that's what that's what foreign exchange strategists, when you ask them

01:19:09 what is the fair value, what is the real effect of exchange rate, What should it

01:19:13 be? They say under 100.

01:19:16 So the dollar yen is at an extreme position.

01:19:20 It it represents the the widest spread in the interest rate world.

01:19:24 Right. Where Japanese rates are close to zero,

01:19:28 U.S. rates are at 5%.

01:19:29 So this extreme, this, in my view, should not be taken as a signal as to

01:19:35 where the dollar is or is going. It's a false signal because it reflects

01:19:40 the unique characteristics of the Japanese U.S.

01:19:44 relationship. On the rate side, it does not translate

01:19:48 into the rest of the world. And I think this is setting up something

01:19:51 that we're starting to pay attention to. And we talked about it at the open, the

01:19:54 signal potential for the dollar to roll over and have almost a momentum effect,

01:20:00 just like we're talking about what tech stocks.

01:20:01 Let's get into that because you mentioned the euro, the single currency

01:20:04 area. Why is the euro against the US dollar

01:20:06 maybe going to be a better example of that in the weeks and months to come?

01:20:09 Well, in part, it's going to be interesting, right, Because the euro

01:20:11 people talk about it should be get parity can be a parity, should be a

01:20:14 parity, and yet it's not at parity. And this is after you've had Germany,

01:20:18 the supposed economic engine of Europe really struggling.

01:20:21 Right. Europe's very interesting because the

01:20:23 growth is in the periphery, not in the core.

01:20:27 That's not the growth. Exactly.

01:20:28 The growth is in Spain and Portugal. It's in Greece.

01:20:31 It's in Italy. And so we used to be you'd be really

01:20:34 concerned about the rate spread between the Italian bonds and the German bonds.

01:20:38 Nobody talks about that anymore because Italy's doing fine.

01:20:41 Germany is the sick engine and yet the euro doesn't want to go to parity.

01:20:45 Okay. The euro is fine at 106107105 fine.

01:20:50 And to us that really suggests that in Europe the bad news is already in the

01:20:55 past we're moving out of the recession. Germany is actually picking up.

01:20:59 And as China continues to improve, the rest of the world improves, Europe will
