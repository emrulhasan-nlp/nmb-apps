00:01 The Fed decides not to decide, Reddit goes public,

00:04 and former President Trump faces foreclosure.

00:07 This is Bloomberg Wall Street Week.

00:08 I'm David Westin.

00:10 This week, Brian Deese on what's really going on with electric vehicles.

00:14 I think those headlines would make you more concerned than you should be.

00:17 The demise of electric vehicles is greatly exaggerated.

00:19 And Christine Roth, the clerk of Barclays, on a comeback for tech IPOs.

00:24 Investor appetite is as strong as it's been in a very long time

00:27 for IPOs.

00:41 But we begin with our very special contributor, Larry Summers of Harvard.

00:44 As we address

00:45 what the Fed decided this week, what we heard from Jay Powell,

00:47 and also maybe a little microeconomics before we're done.

00:50 So, Larry, thanks for being back with us. Let's start with the Fed, though.

00:53 What we heard, I heard.

00:54 More growth, less inflation, low unemployment.

00:57 That sounds pretty good to me. Is it too good to be true?

01:01 I don't know.

01:01 Certainly, there's been some encouraging data flow during 2023, though.

01:06 The last two months haven't been quite so encouraging.

01:10 It's great and right to hope for the best, but hoping isn't planning.

01:15 And certainly from that scenario laid out in the DOT plots,

01:20 I think there's more room for things to surprise on the bad side

01:24 than to surprise on the better side.

01:29 We may have the path that's described there materialize.

01:34 It's certainly got to be recognized as a very real possibility.

01:39 My sense is still that the Fed has itchy fingers

01:43 to start cutting rates, and I don't fully get it.

01:48 We've got unemployment, if anything, below what they think is full capacity.

01:54 We've got inflation clearly even in their forecast

01:59 for the next two years above target.

02:02 We've got GDP growth rising, if anything, faster than potential.

02:08 We have financial conditions.

02:10 The holistic measure of monetary policy at a very loose level.

02:15 I don't know why we're in such a hurry to be talking about moving

02:19 to moving towards the accelerator.

02:24 So we heard from Chair Powell that, in fact,

02:26 he thinks these conditions are restrictive right now.

02:29 They are to stick even if we're not seeing a lot of restriction.

02:32 But that depends in part

02:33 on where the neutral rate is, something we've talked about before.

02:37 I still don't get a sense from the Fed

02:38 that they've figured out where they think the neutral is

02:40 and do they need to know that before they can decide where they're going?

02:44 They need to take a view.

02:46 Because if you don't know what's neutral, you don't know how expansionary

02:50 or restrictive you're being.

02:54 And I find their view that the ultimate neutral rate is 2.6

03:00 to be bizarre in current circumstances.

03:05 Here's what we have relative to a few years ago when they said it was 2.5.

03:12 We've got fiscal policy in a much, much more expansionary place

03:16 with much higher deficits, much larger role of debt.

03:21 That puts pressure on credit markets.

03:24 We've got a huge set of new private sector investments

03:28 going on with respect to green investment in the IRA,

03:34 going on with respect to resilience

03:37 and reducing dependance on single sources.

03:43 We've got a potential huge source of demand

03:46 for chips and for electricity

03:50 coming out of the AI revolution.

03:55 And we've got a huge wealth effect as markets in

03:59 for both housing and stocks have run way up for the last few years.

04:04 So with all of those impulses to demand,

04:08 I cannot understand why

04:11 someone would form the view that the neutral rate was essentially

04:16 the same as they were as they thought it was four years ago.

04:22 And I think the neutral rate is far more likely

04:25 to have a four handle on it right now than it is to have a two handle on it.

04:32 And from that perspective, I'm not at all sure

04:35 how restrictive monetary policy really is.

04:39 And the proof's really in the pudding.

04:41 Monetary policy is by now had a very long time for the legs to work through

04:47 the transmission variables, stock prices,

04:51 interest rates, long term interest rates.

04:54 Credit spreads are flashing green and

05:00 loose,

05:01 and the economy keeps surprising on the high side.

05:05 So either if you look at the fundamental determinants of neutral interest rates

05:11 or you look at how far how fast the economy is growing,

05:15 seems to me you've got to read a high neutral

05:20 interest rate.

05:21 And I just can't understand why the Fed is talking

05:24 about 2.6 as a best guess.

05:28 I would be the first to recognize that this is a number that fluctuates,

05:33 that we can't gauge it precisely, that economists don't have great models.

05:39 So I'm not saying that I'm sure that they're wrong.

05:43 I'm not.

05:44 But I think the challenge in policymaking

05:47 is to try to make best estimates.

05:50 Where you're equally likely to be wrong in both directions.

05:54 Larry, it occurs to me that there are policies

05:56 going beyond monetary policy that could well affect future inflation.

06:00 I'll mention a couple of them.

06:01 Trade and tariffs, which tend to be inflationary.

06:05 President Biden really didn't back off of what President Trump did very much.

06:08 Now we have a candidate Trump, which saw going even further.

06:11 And by the way, immigration, it seems like we're going to constrain immigration.

06:15 And if you really constrain the growth of the workforce, as I understand it,

06:19 that is inflationary.

06:19 What are the other factors that might be driving inflation?

06:22 Part of the story of the great moderation of low inflation for 40 years

06:28 has to have been the ways in which globalization

06:32 held down prices.

06:34 Flows of capital that promoted productivity enhancing investment.

06:39 Flows of workers that enhanced labor

06:43 supply, lower priced goods that provided competition.

06:48 The best forms of competition we get in the US

06:52 economy are often from imported goods.

06:57 And so if globalization held prices down,

07:00 it follows that globalization will tend to push prices up,

07:05 which will mean for some and travel higher rates of inflation.

07:10 And I don't think the prospects of tariff

07:15 increases of reductions in

07:19 immigration, of war, restriction

07:23 on foreign foreign investment, what that means for the dollar,

07:28 I don't think that's reflected in

07:31 consensus inflation views.

07:35 And so I think that's another upside risk to inflation.

07:39 And frankly, it's one that would be substantially exacerbated if the Trump

07:45 program, economic program, at least as it's been described in recent months,

07:51 were to be implemented.

07:54 So you mentioned a flow of capital and foreign investment.

07:57 The United States.

07:58 We have a specific instance right now in the instance of TikTok in the bill.

08:02 that’s passed the House, not passed the Senate.

08:04 What do you make of that issue of trying to divest actually TikTok

08:08 being divested by its Chinese partner and particularly compare and contrast

08:12 to something we've talked about before, which is U.S.

08:13 Steel and the Nippon Steel Investment into that.

08:16 Look, without access to classified information, it's

08:21 difficult to make a definitive judgment

08:24 on either of those cases.

08:28 I would just say this.

08:30 It seems to me, albeit self-evident, that the threat to U.S.

08:35 security from our Chinese adversary

08:41 are controlling the newsfeed.

08:45 That is a primary news feed to more than 100 million Americans

08:51 has to be vastly greater than any risk

08:55 from our staunch ally, Japan.

09:00 Having a private company

09:03 own less than 15% of U.S.

09:07 steel production.

09:09 And so it seems to me there's just a

09:11 very clear disproportion

09:15 in the risks in those two cases.

09:20 And I hope that will factor into our decision making

09:26 going going forward.

09:29 Larry, thank you so much for being with us, as always.

09:32 That's our special contributor, Larry Summers of Harvard.

09:36 Coming up, a readiness to get tech IPO started again.

09:40 We talk with Barclays’ Kristin Roth DeClark

09:42 about what comes next this year with the election kind of looming.

09:46 Later, I could see 20 plus tech IPOs.

09:51 That's next

09:52 on Wall Street Week on Bloomberg.

10:03 This is Wall Street Week.

10:04 I'm David Westin.

10:05 The higher interest rates have taken momentum away from tech IPOs.

10:09 But with Reddit up this week and Astera on deck

10:12 2024 may be the year of the comeback for tech companies going public.

10:17 To take us through it, we welcome back

10:18 Kristin Roth DeClark, Barclays Global head of technology investment banking.

10:22 So welcome.

10:23 It's great to have you here in person instead of San Francisco.

10:25 Yes, great to be here.

10:26 So give us a sense we do have Reddit in this area,

10:28 right, Right in front of us as we speak this week.

10:31 But are we seeing perhaps a break in the logjam in tech IPOs?

10:36 Investor appetite is as strong as it's been in a very long time for IPOs.

10:40 Part of that is because there really is a dearth of growth

10:44 technology assets in the public market that are at scale today.

10:47 And if you look at all of the public tech companies, over $2

10:52 billion market cap, less than 30 have growth rates over 30%.

10:56 So investors are looking for opportunities for growth in the IPO market.

11:01 So is there a profile for the companies they're most likely to be successful?

11:04 Reddit's very different from most era.

11:06 Those are two very different companies, right?

11:08 Well, scale matters to investors.

11:10 We saw, you know, some of the carnage a little bit from the 2020 and 2021

11:15 IPO classes where IPOs were priced at pretty significant premiums

11:21 to where the, you know, multiples have been on a historical basis

11:24 and then traded down significantly the ones that had the,

11:29 you know, smaller market cap, smaller float were disproportionately impacted.

11:33 And for that reason, you know, the scale really matters

11:36 in terms of revenue scale.

11:39 The second piece is,

11:42 you know,

11:42 growth rate and the interplay between growth rate and profitability.

11:45 So it's important to be to have kind of a balance that works growth.

11:50 You get paid more for growth, but that's only if the unit economics work

11:56 and there is a either a break even or a very strong near-term

12:00 path to profitability, you'll get paid more for growth

12:03 if the business is not growing,

12:05 you know, 30% or north of even 20%,

12:09 then having very significant

12:12 margins and visibility and durability

12:14 of those margins as the definition of significant growth change.

12:18 I mean, given when you see some of that going in video,

12:21 some of these growth stocks in tech have just been really, really strong.

12:24 Yeah.

12:25 So I think for for an IPO, I would say a growth stock is something north of 20%.

12:30 30% plus is really very, you know, differentiated growth rate.

12:35 But that's how I would think about it today. What's

12:37 your sense of the pipeline out there for prospective IPOs in the tech area?

12:41 I will tell you, we're tracking over 200 companies that we really think

12:45 have a credible exit in the public market or entry into the public market.

12:51 I guess over the next two years, they could also be, you know,

12:55 sold to strategics or to sponsors.

12:59 But that's kind of the cohort of the private companies

13:03 that were highly focused on for potential IPO is over the next two years

13:06 structurally might be looking at two very different revenue models.

13:09 If you have a consumer facing product such as Reddit, for example,

13:13 what the consumer can do, what they can afford,

13:15 how much they spend, could really affect it.

13:17 On the other hand, if you're over in the artificial intelligence

13:19 and like I mentioned, that term area, that's more of a business to business

13:23 and need for semiconductors and things are there are two different

13:26 revenue models here.

13:27 Yeah, I'd say that the I mean investors right now

13:31 are anything that's AI and anything that is security

13:35 related are probably the two areas that have the strongest bid.

13:40 The consumer facing

13:41 stuff is a little bit more challenged in terms of a multiple.

13:44 You're just not getting the same multiple as you get for an enterprise sale that is

13:47 that has those two and you know, kind of end market AI.

13:51 We're just at the beginning of a decade long, you know, shift

13:55 and change to what we can do from a productivity standpoint.

13:59 And so we've seen a lot of the stocks that are being, you know, that are really

14:04 being driven by the advancements in AI trade up significantly.

14:08 And that will continue.

14:09 I think there are going to be fits and starts and play times

14:12 where investors think, okay, this has been a little bit overbought,

14:15 take, you know, a little bit of profit taking.

14:17 But I think by and large, this is a decade long

14:20 plus shift.

14:23 What about regulation?

14:25 Is there a prospect of regulation, particularly in the tech sector?

14:28 We certainly hear about it from Washington.

14:30 A fair amount is that's sort of a cloud out there on the horizon for investors.

14:34 Well, I think I mean, companies and governments are talking about this a lot.

14:38 It's it's hugely topical,

14:42 not dissimilar from what we faced with the explosion of social media.

14:45 Right.

14:45 But this is obviously more pronounced

14:47 because it's impacting enterprises in a meaningful way.

14:51 So I think it's going to ultimately end up

14:53 being a combination of self regulation from some of the enterprises without

14:59 government oversight to some extent, but it still remains to be seen.

15:03 It certainly is a question,

15:04 but it's difficult for an investor to really discount that, is it not?

15:07 Yeah, it is.

15:08 And I think it's more about, you know,

15:10 what are some of the what's the low hanging fruit And I

15:12 some of the productivity tools for example, versus moving into

15:16 you know what what the art of the possible could be in ten, 20, 30 years.

15:21 It strikes me there's been something of a fallow period here with tech IPOs.

15:25 It's not been as robust as before.

15:27 Do you expect it to turn around and if so, when?

15:30 Yeah, I do.

15:31 I think I mean, you're you're right.

15:32 Last year there were five tech IPOs, a typical year there,

15:35 you know, 40 tech IPOs.

15:37 And this is just in the US.

15:38 I could see this year with the election kind of looming later,

15:42 you know, in the fall, I could see 20 plus tech IPOs.

15:46 And that's more about a readiness standpoint, like the companies

15:49 are actually have everything ready to go to where they could hit

15:53 the market in the spring, summer, you know, leading up to the election.

15:57 And then we have very few windows kind of post-election

16:00 with Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday and, you know, the winter holidays.

16:04 So I could see a 2025 IPO type year for tech.

16:09 I think in next year is where we could see

16:12 kind of a return to the 40 plus, maybe even 50 tech IPOs.

16:16 I wonder, I we've had a fair amount of uncertainty about interest rates.

16:19 We know where the Fed is this week, but we don't know where

16:21 it's going to be next month, for example.

16:23 How is that affecting IPOs and what do you project?

16:25 Yeah, I think the the thing that affects the most are companies with leverage.

16:30 So some of the companies coming out of private equity firms

16:33 that may have been highly levered and then solving for what

16:37 the right leverage profile is for the company on a public basis,

16:40 how much primary capital do they have to raise to bring that leverage

16:44 down to a level that doesn't scare investors because of refinancing

16:48 risk, for example, in the in the high yield market?

16:52 And so that's that's the one place where I think it's impacted

16:56 a little bit and specifically, But I think we're coming out of that

17:00 at a much more positive tone around leverage for investors because it feels

17:04 like we're going to start, you know, taking interest rates the other way.

17:07 But other than that, it's more macro, it's less about business

17:11 specific and more about, you know, what does this do to them,

17:14 to the market overall.

17:15 Christine, really great to have you on and particularly here in New York.

17:17 Thank you for coming to New York.

17:19 That is Christine Ross, the clerk of Barclays.

17:23 Coming up, we

17:23 go through the week in the markets with Chris Harvey of Wells Fargo.

17:27 That's next.

17:28 On Wall Street, Week on Bloomberg.

17:40 This is Wall Street Week.

17:41 I'm David West.

17:41 And markets found a lot to like and what the Fed did and said this week

17:45 as the S&P 500 was up another 2.3% to end at 5234.

17:50 Staying well above the median

17:51 projection of the Bloomberg LS for year end number of only 5100.

17:55 While the yield on the ten year was down 16

17:58 basis points to end the week at 4.2%.

18:01 Take us through where we are. We're welcome back.

18:03 Now one of the Bloomberg elves himself, Chris Harvey, Wells Fargo Securities

18:07 equity analyst. Great to have you back, Chris. It's good to be back.

18:09 So so give us your sense of how the markets interpreted

18:12 what they heard from Jay Powell this week. Oh,

18:16 it was game on.

18:17 So what they heard was, hey, the macro backdrop is hotter

18:21 than we expected on a growth and inflation side,

18:24 but we're going to keep the same accommodation we had before.

18:28 So the only thing that's going to change

18:30 are equity prices and they're going to move higher.

18:32 What that was is to a lot of investors I need to put on.

18:36 I'm not going to be penalized for this.

18:37 I'm going to put more risk on. I probably won't be penalized

18:40 for the leverage I'm going to put more leverage on.

18:42 And things got

18:44 we had a pretty healthy move.

18:46 Let's just say that.

18:47 So one of the things I find surprising is at the beginning of the year,

18:50 we expected something like six or eight countries

18:52 where we've gone from 6 to 3 people, maybe less than that.

18:55 And yet the equity markets didn't really discount to that.

18:58 And why is that? So?

19:00 I agree with that, and that's something we've been talking about.

19:03 But there's more than one equity market.

19:05 So higher rates did affect smaller caps, it affected value and it held those back.

19:10 But when you look at the S&P 500, the S&P 500 is really a growth index.

19:15 And growth has just been lackluster.

19:17 And the fact that you're actually pulling it back to an odd degree

19:20 actually helps because you're not accelerating the economy.

19:24 You're keeping the economy right where it is, which is perfect for growth stocks.

19:27 And the last thing I would say is that you have this amazing

19:30 secular growth story in AI that's not going anywhere fast.

19:34 That's what exactly I was going to ask about because it's great.

19:36 We have, at least for the moment,

19:38 we hope it's all going to prove out as brilliantly as people think it is.

19:42 But is there a risk there in the narrowness of the market

19:44 because it's so tight, tight and high tech?

19:46 And and I there is a risk to it, right?

19:50 We don't like to see the market this narrow, but it does make sense, right.

19:53 When we see a market that's a bit broader, typically see different things.

19:57 We see an economy that's moving from contraction to expansion.

20:00 We're pretty much in this what I would call economic malaise

20:03 where things aren't great, but they're not terrible.

20:05 And you should expect a pretty narrow market.

20:08 And again, the real story here and I don't want to be too repetitive

20:11 with it, is it's a secular growth story that's in play.

20:14 And the fact that the Fed is adding a significant amount

20:16 of accommodation to a period or a situation that really doesn't need it.

20:20 So you like momentum.

20:22 We do need to explain that to us.

20:24 What do you like in this picture

20:26 that really tells you momentum is the way to go?

20:28 So it's not

20:30 What do we really like about it because the market's so narrow,

20:33 because there's not a ton of opportunities.

20:35 Everyone's chasing the same names.

20:37 And so what happens is you get stocks that that do well, continue to do well

20:43 and people say, well, Chris, that's kind of a silly way to invest

20:46 and it's kind of naive and I understand that.

20:49 But if you look at the fundamentals

20:50 for the stocks that are doing very well, the fundamentals are actually quite good.

20:53 And what we keep saying is people are very scared about momentum

20:56 because momentum, if you go back to post financial crisis

21:01 in March of oh nine, momentum or momentum factors

21:04 turned on their head and people lost a lot of money playing momentum.

21:07 Same thing with the pandemic.

21:09 But what we're saying right here, right now, a lot of the macro factors

21:12 that would cause a point of inflection just aren't there be a credit spreads,

21:16 be the economy going from contraction to expansion or the fact

21:20 that the contrarian basket where a lot of broken stocks just don't

21:23 have very good valuations and good fundamentals, So momentum is good.

21:27 Tell me about valuation.

21:28 At what point are they fully valued and tie that back

21:31 in, if you would, to earnings.

21:32 What we're expecting out of earnings

21:33 is that could take care of the valuation problem.

21:35 So, David, what I would say is that we don't have I talk a lot

21:39 about valuation, but our clients aren't talking about valuation all that much.

21:43 And I understand why we're in a relative, we're in a chart looks good

21:47 relative growth type market.

21:48 And so if growth is going higher, you're going to be rewarded by that

21:52 at some point, valuation will matter.

21:54 But because growth is moving so quickly for a select number of stocks,

21:58 there's really just one game in town and that will continue for a while.

22:02 What I think and what you have to worry about with the rotation or broadening

22:05 out in the market is will the economy accelerate faster than we expect?

22:10 And that could cause a rotation and we just don't see that right now.

22:13 One last one.

22:14 We have another game in town coming up in November.

22:16 It's called an election.

22:17 Do we take that into account at all as we take a look

22:19 at investing in the stock market right now? We do.

22:21 I don't know how to handicap the the presidential election

22:25 and luckily I don't have to.

22:27 The real game in town here is the Senate who wins the Senate

22:31 and it looks like the GOP has a better than a 5050 chance at winning the Senate.

22:35 Why is this important?

22:37 This is important because this could change the regulatory environment.

22:41 The M&A market is improving.

22:43 And if the GOP does take the Senate, we would expect an acceleration

22:47 of the M&A market later on in the year because of the potential change

22:50 with regulation.

22:51 So you think the antitrust enforcement policies have held back some M&A?

22:55 That's part of the reason we've seen as Absolutely.

22:58 There's not a question.

22:59 It has absolutely held back some M&A last one, taxes,

23:02 because there's a question we're renewing the Trump tax cuts.

23:04 How important is that in the Senate?

23:06 It's important, but it's not something a lot of people are talking to us right now.

23:10 So I think it's more of a 25, 26 issue.

23:13 It's not really a big issue.

23:15 And top of mind for many investors at this point in time thing.

23:18 But you don't want to handicap the election. You sure

23:21 we can still do that?

23:22 If you want. You can tell us who's going to win if you want.

23:24 I'll just say we'll have we'll have a president, We'll have this go and vote.

23:28 I'm going to vote.

23:29 Yeah, we got I can handicap, but we'll have a president, which is good news.

23:32 Thank you so much, Chris, for being back With us is Chris Harvey of Wells Fargo.

23:38 Coming up, is the push for EVs losing its momentum?

23:41 We talk with the man who constructed the Biden administration policies,

23:45 Brian Deese of MIT.

23:48 That's next.

23:49 On Wall Street Week on Bloomberg.

24:00 This is Wall Street Week.

24:01 I'm David Westin.

24:02 Electric vehicles are a policy priority in the United States, in Europe

24:05 and in China.

24:06 Even as automakers, at least the United States trim back their ambitious goals.

24:10 Brian Deese has been at the center of auto policy in the United States.

24:13 First, as a member of the Obama administration team

24:16 that rescued the industry during the great financial crisis, and then more recently

24:20 as director of President Biden's National Economic Council.

24:23 And we welcome him now to Wall Street Week. Brian.

24:24 Welcome. It's good to have you here. I'm happy to be here.

24:27 Bring us up to speed on electric vehicles as they were all the rage

24:30 just a couple of years ago.

24:30 And now when you read in the press,

24:32 maybe not quite so much, maybe the consumers are not rushing to buy them.

24:36 You see some U.S. automakers cutting back on their goals.

24:39 What's going on?

24:39 Well, I think those headlines would make you more concerned that you should be

24:43 that the demise of electric vehicles is greatly exaggerated.

24:46 So let's start with the numbers.

24:48 So in 2023, there were about

24:51 1.4 million electric vehicles sold in the United States.

24:54 That was almost 10% of overall sales.

24:57 That was up 50% from a year before.

24:59 So really significant growth.

25:01 First couple of months of this year, EV sales are up about 20%, 15 to 20%.

25:07 So the rate of growth is slowing.

25:10 But I think that that's actually reasonably what you would expect.

25:14 This is a market

25:15 that as it matures and as it becomes a larger share of overall vehicle sales

25:20 expecting year on year, 50%

25:23 growth rates was never realistic.

25:26 And so I think the question is where will this growth trajectory

25:31 lead out

25:33 and also when will the appetite for this electric feels

25:36 but up against consumer concerns and consumer adoption?

25:40 I don't think we're there yet.

25:42 And so, you know, a rate of growth that's 20% year over year would be

25:45 pretty good for a lot of industries.

25:47 But we're certainly seeing a slowing compared to the rate of pickup

25:50 in 2022 and 2023, which was really quite extraordinary.

25:54 Overall, the demand for EVs, the United States continues to go up

25:57 even if more slowly, but different makers are taking

26:00 different approaches to stimulating that demand.

26:04 Ford, for example, cut prices significantly

26:07 on the Mustang Mach-e as a response to demand.

26:12 All eyes will be on Tesla, of course, because Tesla is the marketing company.

26:16 Pure play ev name how it says in the first quarter will be critically important.

26:22 You know, there is something happening where the early adopters in America

26:26 have been and gone in terms of the consumer

26:28 and there is still an assessment to be done on how impactful

26:33 the incentives provided by the inflation reduction Act are going to be.

26:38 And it's not just the traditional Big Three US automakers seeking

26:41 to take advantage of those incentives, raising the specter of the US being left

26:45 behind by overseas producers the way we saw in the 1970s.

26:50 Well, I think there's a risk.

26:51 I think you listen to what

26:53 the leadership of Ford and GM instill into it as well are saying.

26:58 They recognize they're behind that.

27:00 This is fundamentally a technology play.

27:03 Electric vehicles, it's a it's a fundamental shift in technology.

27:07 It's not just an incremental shift in vehicle technology.

27:11 And they were behind Tesla on they are both ahead.

27:17 That said, I think you're seeing as certainly GM and Ford

27:20 both invest a lot in saying we need to we need to catch up

27:24 and we need to catch up quickly, I would say.

27:25 Ford's CEO, Jim Farley, has been very blunt about this in saying

27:29 we're going to need to remake this company.

27:31 We're going to need to do things differently in terms of how we organize

27:34 ourselves to drive innovation, to actually catch up and catch up

27:38 quickly in a growing global market as well.

27:42 So I am hopeful that what we'll see is that

27:46 that kind of commitment actually manifests in the marketplace.

27:49 And we've certainly seen some we're seeing those companies

27:52 increase their sales sequentially as well.

27:56 But I think that that's always a risk.

27:59 Right? We have to we we're going to have to stay ahead.

28:01 And it's a dynamic global market.

28:02 Is there a challenge in the price point?

28:03 Because certainly a GM, for example, started out

28:05 with a more expensive vehicles made sense because they needed to cover the costs.

28:09 At the same time,

28:10 again, going back to my recollection of when Japan really made inroads.

28:13 They started out pretty inexpensively.

28:15 You have some less expensive models coming from overseas.

28:18 Yeah, look, there's different

28:20 different approaches to this electric vehicle market that are really fascinating

28:23 where I think the the dominant approach is to start at the very high price point,

28:28 try to capture that margin and then drive drive prices down across the board.

28:32 I would argue that actually learning from history, there's a real opportunity

28:36 to own the lower cost segment of this market, right, to be the electric vehicle

28:42 provider for typical middle class folks across the country.

28:45 We've seen some innovation on that front.

28:47 GM introduced the Chevy Bolt and for a part of last year,

28:52 it was the fastest growing electric vehicle in the country.

28:57 And so I think it's it's possible.

28:59 And the other thing that's good news for consumers is in addition

29:03 to seeing this electric vehicle growth, prices are coming down very significantly.

29:07 We've seen a 20% reduction in the cost of the purchase price

29:11 of electric vehicles just over the course of the last several months.

29:14 That presents a constructive challenge

29:16 to the auto companies, But it's good news for consumers

29:18 that we're seeing more and more of these vehicles get into a price point,

29:21 which is really in many ways, you know, comparable,

29:24 particularly when you take into account the overall cost of ownership.

29:28 The Biden administration has made no secret of its desire

29:31 to urge the auto industry ahead in the transformation to EVs

29:34 as it seeks to put its foot on the accelerator of electric

29:37 and step on the brake for internal combustion engines.

29:41 And then we kind of have the carrot and the stick approach where the carrot

29:45 is, the incentives provided for by the Inflation Reduction Act.

29:49 But just this week,

29:50 the Biden administration came in with the stick more stringent tailpipe

29:54 emissions by 2032, particularly aimed at the likes of GM and Ford

29:59 to accelerate their transition to selling more battery

30:02 electric vehicles because their combustion engine cars will be bound by these new,

30:06 stricter rules.

30:07 You have to remember that GM and Ford are using the kind of highly profitable

30:11 combustion engine pickup focused business to fund their transition to EV.

30:15 The problem is, is that there is kind of some softness in both of those,

30:19 and particularly more softness in heavy demand than they perhaps expected.

30:23 And one thing that's sorely needed if we're to get to an electric vehicle

30:27 future, is a way to charge those vehicles across the country.

30:31 The single most important thing the government needs to do is to backstop

30:35 the build out of an electric vehicle charging infrastructure.

30:38 It's interesting, if you look at the cost effectiveness of

30:42 a public investment to actually reduce emissions across time,

30:46 there's probably no higher bang for buck investment

30:49 than a public investment in infrastructure.

30:50 And if you think about it, it makes sense, right?

30:52 Who's going to build out the backbone of chargers across the country

30:56 to help address range anxiety and give people a sense that this will be

30:59 as easy as owning an internal combustion vehicle.

31:03 The good news is the government is doing that

31:05 and backing that in a significant way.

31:06 That was part of the infrastructure

31:08 of the bipartisan infrastructure bill that we passed in 2021.

31:12 And that money is now hitting the streets and we're starting to see

31:16 significant build out of that infrastructure.

31:18 We're going to need to make sure that that stays on track

31:21 and that the experience, the charging experience, is not just that

31:25 there are chargers there,

31:25 but the experience itself is easy and straightforward so that consumers

31:30 feel as if this is something that they can get comfortable with

31:33 the way things have developed.

31:34 We can't talk about electric vehicles without talking about China and BYD.

31:37 It's becoming a real factor globally.

31:40 We just had the former President Trump

31:42 talk about the possibility of manufacturing in Mexico,

31:44 hundred percent tariffs that come across the border.

31:46 How big a factor is China and how should the government handle that challenge?

31:50 Because the BYD automobiles are at a much lower price point, I believe.

31:54 They're they're lower price.

31:55 I also think they're not they're not particularly well positioned for the U.S.

31:58 market in the U.S. consumer.

32:00 Look, I think we need to step back.

32:01 The the challenge that we have with China right now is quite significant.

32:06 And we need to have a strategy to address that.

32:09 And part of what is happening

32:11 is China's got very significant imbalances in its own economy,

32:14 and it has to make some difficult decisions about

32:16 whether it's going to double down on a strategy that is over subsidizes

32:20 and often in in inappropriate or illegal ways subsidize its manufacturing base

32:26 at the expense of more balanced domestic growth in its own economy

32:29 and at the expense of other economies worldwide.

32:33 And that overcapacity issue is an issue for the U.S.

32:36 economy, but it's also an issue for the European economy.

32:39 It's an issue for other economies as well as interesting.

32:41 Just this week, we saw Brazil actually raised the prospect

32:44 of anti-dumping duties against China because they're facing these pressures

32:48 as well.

32:49 I do think that the that Chinese model of just

32:53 pushing manufacturing above all else,

32:55 including above its own balanced domestic growth, is not a tenable long term model.

33:00 We in the United States that we need a strategy to succeed on our own.

33:04 And part of that is making a commitment to invest in our own industrial capacity.

33:09 One of the things I would note is that in the last year,

33:12 the single category of manufacturing investment

33:15 that has grown the fastest in the U.S.

33:17 is in the upstream electric vehicle battery supply chain.

33:20 It's a $42 billion in manufacturing investment

33:24 going into everything from upstream processing of critical minerals

33:28 to battery assembly and then ultimately electric vehicle assembly as well.

33:33 There's a lot of investment in the United States to build that capacity.

33:36 And as that happens, hopefully, as we were talking about, prices will come down.

33:39 Finally talking about the labor consequences of electric vehicles,

33:43 as I understand it, takes significantly fewer workers to produce

33:46 an electric vehicle than an internal combustion engine car.

33:49 What does this mean for the auto worker, which is very much on everyone's

33:52 mind right now?

33:53 Well, look, I think what you need to look at is the entire value chain.

33:57 And so the electric vehicle itself, from an assembly perspective,

34:01 has fewer parts and therefore less labor.

34:04 The building of the batteries and the whole upstream supply chain there

34:07 creates new opportunity and new opportunity for workers and for labor.

34:11 So that whole battery supply chain that I was just talking about, it's referred

34:14 now often as the battery belt.

34:16 You know, from Michigan down to Georgia, we're seeing this investment

34:19 in the manufacturing and the processing and these upstream components as well.

34:24 Taken together,

34:25 that creates real new opportunities for American workers and American labor.

34:29 I think it's one of the reasons why these things aren't easy.

34:32 But you've seen even the UAW come around and recognize

34:38 that this is the future of the industry, and the opportunity

34:40 is to effectively organize that whole value chain.

34:44 And they're seeing more opportunity than threat from

34:46 that is a fair amount of risk filling required in order to do that.

34:50 Yes or no, in the sense that the the the best positioned workers

34:54 to actually do that work in the future are the existing workers

34:58 who have been trained and worked in a lot of auto plants

35:02 or in the suppliers Tier one and Tier two suppliers.

35:05 Those workers are the best positioned

35:07 and they should be in a position to actually have a shot, a fair shot

35:11 at jobs in the battery supply chain.

35:12 At the same time, we're talking about really cutting edge,

35:15 innovative technology.

35:17 And so whether that's the chemistry involved or storage more generally

35:20 and I mean, this is exciting.

35:22 We're talking about batteries for electric vehicles,

35:23 but the storage technology itself

35:25 is also going to help solve a lot of our energy needs, create a grid

35:29 that is more dynamic and less susceptible to risk, help feed the need for energy

35:34 that's going to come from data centers that is powering

35:36 so the underlying technology of how we store energy,

35:40 whether that's in a vehicle or in a much larger battery, is one of these.

35:44 There is a cutting edge innovation where reskilling and frankly,

35:48 we need new we need new innovation as well.

35:51 I'm happy to say that Variety is going to be staying with us

35:53 as we turn to what this fall's presidential election could mean

35:56 for the U.S. economy.

35:59 That's next.

35:59 On Wall Street.

36:00 Week on Bloomberg.

36:12 This is Wall Street Week.

36:13 I'm David Westin, former National Economic Council director.

36:16 Brian Deese has stayed with us to talk about the economy.

36:18 So, Brian, we've got an election coming up.

36:20 You may not have noticed it coming November, and it looks like

36:23 it's going to be Joe Biden versus Donald Trump once again.

36:27 Give us your sense, having been in the White House, what difference does it make?

36:31 Because it occurs to me

36:32 sometimes I think we put too much pressure on the president and the White House.

36:36 They can't control everything. Economy.

36:38 How much of a difference does it really make?

36:40 Well, look, I don't know if this election

36:44 is going to be decided on policy and policy differences,

36:48 but it should be,

36:49 because if you look at the difference between these two candidates,

36:53 the differences are as stark as any certainly any election in modern history.

36:58 We've got

36:59 President Biden's got a basic approach to the economy that he has laid out.

37:03 And now you can see we're talking about significant investment

37:07 in industrial renewal in the United States,

37:10 a commitment to the idea that public investment in things like infrastructure,

37:14 things like clean energy, a build out of the semiconductor industry, will help

37:17 to expand productive capacity, ultimately expand real wage growth.

37:21 And that's his strategy.

37:23 And then, frankly, it's consistent with who he is and how he's approached

37:26 the economy for some time.

37:30 Candidate Trump,

37:31 on the other hand, is a dramatic, dramatic departure.

37:36 And the thing that I think we're probably paying insufficient attention to

37:40 is at a moment where prices are the top issue on Americans minds.

37:45 And we've finally seen real progress in bringing inflation down

37:48 and bringing prices down.

37:50 The basic Trump approach of protectionism

37:53 across the board, indiscriminate tariffs, shutting down immigration

37:56 and raising costs like health care costs by getting rid

38:00 of pharmaceutical regulations.

38:01 Getting rid of the Affordable Care Act is a recipe for significant

38:06 inflationary pressures in the economy and price increases for typical families.

38:10 So I think that that's a real short term effect and a real difference

38:15 between these two candidates. Let's take a couple of those, if we could.

38:18 They are immigration and they are for protectionism, as you put it, on trade.

38:23 President Biden has not really dialed back

38:25 substantially on the tariffs put in place under President Trump, as I recall.

38:29 And certainly when it comes to China, it doesn't

38:30 sound like they have a very different position.

38:32 Is there really a difference when it comes to trade between these two men?

38:36 I think there is. I think it's pretty stark.

38:38 If President Biden has had a sort of a basic two part approach

38:42 when it comes to trade, which is, one, have a very targeted approach

38:46 to protecting American interests, economic and national security

38:49 when it's warranted, and to really committing to work

38:53 with partners and allies to try to build more capability and effectiveness

38:58 when that is the case.

38:59 So if you look at something like semiconductors,

39:01 the Trump administration really didn't take any action

39:03 when we were looking at sensitive dual use technologies that were potentially

39:08 getting in the hands of the Chinese or other adversaries.

39:11 The Biden administration came in, President Biden came in and said,

39:14 I am going to put a stop to that.

39:15 But I'm going to work with my allies and partners

39:17 to do so, because otherwise it's fundamentally ineffective.

39:21 You contrast that with the Trump approach, which is still emerging.

39:25 So we'll have to see what happens on the campaign.

39:27 But if it does turn out that what we're talking about

39:29 is a 10% across the board tariff on all products

39:33 coming into the United States from Allied countries, from from countries

39:37 or from products where we don't produce anything here in the United States.

39:40 A cup of coffee that is a very extreme and new step.

39:46 You talk about completely eliminating permanent normal trade relationships

39:50 with China.

39:52 Candidate Trump has said at times,

39:53 I want to literally eliminate all imports from China, period, and stop.

39:57 The macro economic impact of those steps would be significant.

40:02 You know, potentially a couple of points off a GDP

40:05 and a practical impact on those four families would be

40:08 quite significant to people would start to see it.

40:11 And I think that a general Trump approach is one of core isolationism,

40:16 which is not only to break those barriers, but basically to alienate our allies

40:20 in the process that creates, you know, potentially larger across the board.

40:25 So I think that the the top line well, you know,

40:29 there's not that much difference in the mind.

40:30 Trade is is a is is a complicated position when you when you unpack it.

40:35 And what about immigration?

40:36 There was a time there seemed to be a very big difference with them.

40:39 President former President Trump certainly would say there's a big difference, but

40:42 it feels like President Biden has moved toward the position of President Trump.

40:46 Is there a big difference this point?

40:47 Isn't any president going to have to address

40:49 that southern border no matter what 100% The border will need to be addressed.

40:52 There need to be addressed in a appropriate and aggressive way.

40:56 I think the big difference and what I what I worry about is with respect

41:00 to the legal immigration system.

41:02 So one of the significant things we've seen over the past couple of years,

41:05 the reason why we've seen significant increases in labor supply and labor force

41:09 participation, it's legal immigration has come back after COVID

41:13 and after the Trump administration,

41:15 as well as more women coming into the workforce.

41:17 That process of legal immigration that is now normalized.

41:20 And the Biden administration prioritize, for example, working down

41:23 visa backlogs and trying to get to a more normal system.

41:27 I think under a Trump administration, you could expect that to revert.

41:31 And I think in addition to that being bad for innovation and bad for

41:35 for broader economic growth, it could also be

41:39 quite inflationary in the short term

41:41 because what you're doing is constricting labor supply at a moment

41:44 where we need more we need more workers in the United States.

41:47 Our legal immigration system has been an engine

41:50 for growth for decades, for a long time.

41:53 I think that there would be a big difference

41:55 on that front, because I think you're right.

41:57 With respect to the southern border, it will need to be addressed.

41:59 It will need to be addressed in a realistic but aggressive way.

42:03 What about fiscal policy?

42:04 And as you said, President Biden has really pursued a policy of investment

42:08 which is amounted to fiscal stimulus.

42:11 There's a fair amount of it's still to be expressed.

42:13 It hasn't come through the system yet.

42:15 Is there a big difference in addressing the deficit and the debt?

42:17 Because a lot of people, at least on Wall Street,

42:19 are pretty concerned about it at this point?

42:20 Yeah, Well, I think there's there's there's reason for concern.

42:23 The big difference the biggest difference here is with respect to tax policy.

42:27 And they're the numbers are very large.

42:29 So if you look at there's a recent analysis of

42:32 what would it look like from for Trump policy to go into effect.

42:35 If you're talking about both extending the Trump tax cuts

42:40 that were put place in 2017, many of which expire in 2025.

42:44 And then you add on to that, it's things that Trump has been talking

42:47 about to include a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 15%.

42:51 All told, that would be about $4.6 trillion

42:54 in additional tax cuts over a decade.

42:56 That's almost two percentage

42:58 points of GDP would take our revenue down below 15% of GDP.

43:02 Very different from what a President Biden is talking about,

43:05 where he's talking about actually trying to increase taxes, raise

43:09 that corporate tax rate back up from 21 closer to 28%,

43:13 increase taxes on the very wealthy by a significant amount.

43:17 That could raise a couple of trillion dollars.

43:19 So that gap between the two is well over $5 trillion.

43:24 That will be a line of debate and a line of demarcation in 2025.

43:29 But given the fiscal backdrop we have,

43:31 I think if the market actually internalizes the idea

43:34 that we're not going to do anything about the Trump tax cut extension and in fact,

43:38 we're going to come in, we're going to layer on that with additional tax cuts,

43:42 then I think that you'll start to see that in in impact on line

43:45 to borrowing costs, because it will send a signal

43:47 that we don't really have serious plan to address the revenue

43:51 shortfall that we have in this country.

43:53 Ryan, thank you so much for being on Wall Street.

43:55 Really good to have you here.

43:56 That is former National Economic Council director Brian Deese.

44:01 Coming up, the magical

44:02 world of mushrooms comes to global Wall Street.

44:06 That's next.

44:06 On Wall Street Week on Bloomberg.

44:18 Finally, one more thought.

44:20 Socrates said, my friend,

44:22 care for your psyche, Know thyself for once we know ourselves.

44:26 We may learn how to care for ourselves.

44:28 And let's face it, just about all of us could take better care of ourselves

44:32 by getting enough sleep and reducing stress.

44:35 We see that these five daily behaviors of sleep, food, movement,

44:40 stress and connection dramatically affect

44:45 our health and our longevity.

44:48 People who run big companies like Indra Nooyi of Pepsi see

44:52 a greater need than ever to care for the psyches of their employees.

44:56 I think post-pandemic

44:58 we are seeing more and more people say, I have to worry about me as a person.

45:01 I have to worry about my family.

45:02 I want to worry about my well-being, my mental health.

45:06 So we've got to start encompassing people

45:09 as holistic humans as opposed to a tool of the train.

45:12 Some of us turn to psychotherapists mob boss Tony Soprano did.

45:17 Any thoughts at all on why you blacked out?

45:19 I don't know. Stress, maybe.

45:22 But for some, it's not enough to get more sleep

45:24 or have a more thoughtful boss or have someone to talk to.

45:27 Some of us turn to chemistry,

45:29 like Elon Musk, who is talking about his use of ketamine again.

45:33 There are times when I have

45:37 sort of a,

45:41 I don't know,

45:41 like a negative chemical state in my in my brain.

45:45 Like depression, I guess, you know, or like depression.

45:48 That's not linked to any negative lives.

45:52 And then ketamine is helpful for

45:55 getting anyone else out of a negative frame of mind.

45:58 And now there's a new game in town or really an old game

46:02 that some of us may remember, perhaps hazily from the 1960s.

46:07 Yes, there's a return to magic mushrooms.

46:10 Mike Tyson does it.

46:11 Even when he was partying in St Barts

46:13 with Jake Paul, the man he's due to fight this July.

46:16 Are you taking shrooms before the workout?

46:18 Just because, like, the the space of thinking?

46:21 Oh, absolutely.

46:22 The focus and this of shrooms.

46:24 It can't compare to nothing.

46:26 Okay.

46:26 Chelsea Handler does it with her employees.

46:29 You took them camping and everyone took mushrooms.

46:31 I didn't provide the mushrooms just for legal reasons.

46:33 I want that to be stated very clear.

46:35 Where in the budget is that? Is that craft service? Yeah.

46:40 People can pick mushrooms in the forest.

46:42 Bloomberg this week reported on so-called magic mushrooms

46:45 being touted by executive coaches and Wall Street Journal had a piece

46:49 on these magic mushrooms being, quote, the working woman's newest life hack.

46:54 Steve Cohen has doubled down on his investment in Sabin.

46:57 That's a bio pharmaceutical firm.

46:59 In clinical trials for a medicine to handle serious depression, a medicine

47:03 that uses, you guessed it, the active element found in magic mushrooms.

47:08 Given all the buzz, maybe this really is the way to go.

47:12 But as my wife could tell you, I'm pretty conservative.

47:14 And back in the nineties when I was general counsel of Capsids ABC,

47:18 we had a big commitment to the Partnership for a Drug Free America.

47:22 That's a charity founded by Jay and Jay CEO Jim Burke,

47:25 who just happened to be the brother of my boss, Dan Burke, And the essays

47:29 we ran on ABC had a decidedly different approach to psychedelics.

47:33 This is your brain,

47:36 This is drugs.

47:43 This is your brain on drugs.

47:45 That does it for this episode of Wall Street Week.

47:47 I'm David Westin. This is Bloomberg.
