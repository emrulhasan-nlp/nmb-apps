Former President Donald Trump said he has been notified that he is a target in the Justice Department’s investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, signaling that he is likely to be charged with federal crimes.

In a post on his Truth Social account Tuesday, Trump said he received the notice Sunday night from Special Counsel Jack Smith , who is investigating Trump’s actions in the aftermath of the presidential election, including the insurrection at the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.
