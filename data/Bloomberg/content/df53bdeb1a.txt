California said its population grew last year for the first time since the pandemic began in 2020 amid decreased mortality and a pickup in legal immigration, indicators that may provide benefits to the world’s fifth-largest economy.

A report released Tuesday by the California Department of Finance showed that as of Jan. 1, the state’s population increased 0.17% percent to 39.13 million, adding over 67,000 people. Of the state’s 58 counties, 31 had gains, with most of that growth concentrated in the Bay Area, Central Valley and Inland Empire near coastal Southern California.
