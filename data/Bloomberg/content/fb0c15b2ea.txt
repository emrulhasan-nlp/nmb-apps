00:15 >> I DO THINK THAT IT'S CLEAR THAT POLICY IS RESTRICTIVE.

00:20 >> THE WHOLE GAME PLAN IS NOT CHANGED.

00:21 WE WILL KEEP RATES HERE UNTIL WE ARE CONFIDENT.

00:26 >> THE ACCELERATION IS PROBABLY OVERSTATED BUT WE HAVE GOT TO

00:27 SEE WHERE WE ARE GOING.

00:32 >> THE FED IS TELLING US, LOOK AT THE LONG-TERM.

00:36 LOOK AT WHERE INFLATION WAS.

00:38 >> I WORRY THAT THEY WILL NOT END UP CUTTING BECAUSE THEY ARE

00:43 SO DATA-DEPENDENT AND THEY WON'T LOOK AT THE WEAKNESS THAT

00:44 IS COMING.

00:48 >> THIS IS "BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE." JONATHAN:

00:53 LET'S GET YOUR MORNING STARTED. LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY THIS

00:55 MORNING, GOOD MORNING, GOOD MORNING.

01:00 THIS IS "BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE ."

01:01 THE S&P 500, BOUNCING BACK FROM A STRANGE DAY OF LOSSES,

01:07 POSITIVE BY ZERO POINT 6%. WE SAID THIS YESTERDAY AFTER

01:11 CHAIRMAN POWELL SPOKE, THE PRESSER ENDED ALMOST AS SOON AS

01:13 IT STARTED. THE TOP LINE HEADLINE,

01:17 RESTRICTIVE WITH NOTHING ELSE SEEMED TO MATTER. LISA:

01:22 TAKING OFF THE PROSPECT OF RATE HIKES TOOK AWAY THE TAIL RISK

01:25 OF THEM BECOMING EVEN MORE RESTRICTIVE AND REPEATING THAT

01:28 THEY ARE ON THE RIGHT PATH. THAT WAS THE ENTIRETY OF WHAT

01:30 WAS ACCOMPLISHED. IT SEEMS LIKE THIS PUTS IT BACK

01:33 TO WHERE IT WAS BEFORE. IT IS IN THE HANDS OF EARNINGS

01:39 AND IT RAISES THE QUESTION OF ON THE LONG END, HOW MUCH WILL

01:42 THIS RE-ACCELERATE? JONATHAN:

01:48 THE FED WILL CUT AS SOON AS THE DATA ALLOWS.

01:49 BANK OF AMERICA, HE'S IN A WAIT AND SEE MODE.

01:54 DEUTSCHE BANK, HARD TO SAY IT WAS A DOVISH MEETING, BUT GIVEN

01:58 THE RECENT INFLATION PRINT, IT COULD HAVE BEEN MORE HAWKISH

02:00 AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO DISAGREE WITH THAT TAKE. ANNMARIE:

02:04 IT ABSOLUTELY FELT DOVISH. IT FELT VERY BRITISH.

02:10 KEEP CALM, CARRY ON, WAIT FOR THE CONFIDENCE.

02:13 WHAT HE DID MENTION WAS PRETTY MUCH THAT HIKES ARE VERY

02:15 UNLIKELY. DOESNâ€™'T SEEM LIKE THE FED SEES

02:22 A PATH TO HIKING RATES. I LOVE WHAT STEPHEN STANLEY

02:25 SAID, MAYBE IT WAS ME BUT DID YOU SEE THE PRESS CONFERENCE

02:29 TODAY SETTING AN ALL-TIME HIGH FOR AWKWARDNESS AND ALL-TIME

02:32 LOW FOR INFORMATION CONTENT. HE THINKS THE QUESTIONS WERE

02:36 GOOD AND PRECISE, BUT THAT POWELL WAS OBFUSCATING.

02:38 JONATHAN: I'M PLEASED THAT STANLEY SAID

02:40 IT. I KNOW THAT SOME PEOPLE SAID THAT AT THE BEGINNING.

02:46 THE MEDIA EXCHANGE IN THE EARLY PART WHERE HE WAS ASKED ABOUT

02:49 BEING RESTRICTIVE, POINTED TO EVIDENCE OF IT IN THE LABOR

02:50 MARKET. THIS WILL BE INTERESTING TOMORROW MORNING.

02:57 THREE-MONTH AVERAGE FOR PAYROLL 670,000.

02:59 THE ESTIMATE TOMORROW IS 340. I CAN PICK A BANK AFTER BIG

03:03 BANK WHERE IT'S 250. IT'S HARD TO SEE IT IN THE

03:07 HEADLINE NUMBERS FOR TOMORROW MORNING. LISA:

03:12 TAKE A LOOK AT THE BEIGE BOOK AND THE QUICK RATE, THEY ARE

03:16 MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE LABOR MARKET REPORT FOR TOMORROW,

03:18 THAT WAS THE TONE THAT WE GOT. YOU MENTIONED CITIGROUP.

03:24 THEY STILL SEE 100 POINTS OF CUTS THIS YEAR.

03:27 RAISING THE QUESTION TO YOUR POINT, JIM REED, WAS IT LESS

03:32 HAWKISH THAN IT COULD HAVE BEEN IN TERMS OF NOT NECESSARILY

03:33 PUSHING BACK? OR WAS IT A DOVISH POSITION

03:36 WITH AN EXCUSE TO CUT?

03:42 JONATHAN: DOVISH ACTION AT THE PEAK OF

03:46 THE NEWS CONFERENCE, IT FADES GOING INTO THE CLOSE AND WE ARE

03:50 DOWN BY 2/10 OF 1%. NOT JUST THE EQUITY MARKET, THE

03:54 FOREIGN EXCHANGE AS WELL, THE TIME WAS 4 A.M.

03:58 IN TOKYO AND SUDDENLY DOLLAR-YEN IS AGGRESSIVELY

04:00 LOWER OFF THE BACK OF WHAT WE NOW BELIEVE IS MORE

04:05 INTERVENTION.

04:06 LISA: 22 POINT $6 BILLION WHERE THEY

04:09 TRY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A WINDOW WHERE THEY SAW A

04:12 REPRIEVE ON THE U.S. SIDE WHERE THEY THOUGHT THEY

04:13 COULD COME IN. WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?

04:18 STAVING OFF CURRENCY WEAKNESS? THEY DIDN'T SUCCEED.

04:22 IF IT'S ABOUT BLOWING THE SHORTS AROUND HOW FAR YOU CAN

04:25 PUSH AGAINST JAPANESE AUTHORITIES, THEY MIGHT HAVE

04:26 WON. JONATHAN:

04:33 COMING UP THIS HOUR, FANTASTIC CONVERSATIONS WITH OPPENHEIMER

04:38 AS JAY POWELL SIX TO A DOVISH SCRIPT. APPLE EARNINGS ON DECK.

04:41 THOSE EARNINGS ARE COMING LATER THIS AFTERNOON.

04:44 ANDREW HAN HORSE SAYING THAT THE FED COULD STILL DELIVER

04:47 RATE CUTS THIS YEAR. TOP STORY, BOND YIELDS EASING

04:51 AS JAY POWELL CALMS THE FEARS OF ANOTHER RATE HIKE, SAYING

04:57 THAT THE OPERATIVE PHRASE IS FOR RATES TO REMAIN AT CURRENT

05:01 LEVELS FOR LONGER THAN EXPECTED RATHER THAN MOVING HIGHER FOR

05:02 LONGER. JOHN IS WITH US AROUND THE

05:03 TABLE. GOOD MORNING TO YOU. IS THE FED ALIVE AND WELL AFTER

05:07 THAT?

05:12 >> I THINK IT IS, AT LEAST FOR NOW, AND THAT CAN CHANGE FROM

05:16 DAY TO DAY AS THE MARKET KEEPS DIGESTING YESTERDAY.

05:20 WE WEREN'T SURPRISED. LIKE EVERYBODY, WE WEREN'T

05:25 EXPECTING A CHANGE IN TERMS OF RATES, BUT THERE WAS GREATER

05:28 CLARIFICATION AND IF ANYTHING WE ARE AT A POINT NOW WHERE THE

05:31 MARKET IS BEGINNING TO GET IT. IT IS NORMALIZATION OF INTEREST

05:35 RATES. THERE WILL STILL BE THE ARGUMENT THAT THE FED IS STILL

05:42 TOO TIGHT IN TERMS OF THE ECONOMY.

05:46 BUT THAT USUALLY WOULD BE COMING FROM HIGHLY LEVERAGED

05:50 PLAYERS THAT ARE STILL IN SHOCK FROM THE CHANGE FROM AN

05:53 ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE BENCHMARK RATE WAS 0.25 AND NOW FIVE AND

05:56 A HALF. JONATHAN: MOHAMED EL-ERIAN WAS ON

06:02 YESTERDAY AND HE POINTED US TOWARDS WHAT CHAIRMAN POWELL

06:06 WAS SAYING, >> EMERGING IN PLACES LIKE MCDONALD'S,

06:09 CORPORATE AMERICA, WALMART, STARBUCKS.

06:12 YOU CAN PICK INDIVIDUAL REASONS AS TO WHY THEY ARE STRUGGLING,

06:15 BUT ARE YOU SEEING THAT?

06:22 JOHN: MORE LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW

06:25 IS REFLECTIVE OF WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING FOR THE LAST TWO

06:29 YEARS, LEADING TO AN END OF THE TIGHTENING CYCLE IS WHERE WE

06:30 ARE HEADED. SO, THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS WILL

06:34 BE SOME RELAXATION. STILL, WE DON'T THINK THAT

06:36 RATES ARE GOING BACK TO WHERE THEY WERE DURING EMERGENCY

06:43 STANDARDS FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS BETWEEN THE GMC AND THE

06:44 FINANCIAL CRISIS WITH THE PANDEMIC AND THE FALLOUT OF

06:45 THAT.

06:51 BUT IT IS A NORMALIZATION PROCESS AND WE HAVE TALKED

06:53 ABOUT IT A LOT. THE PERCEPTION AROUND WHAT A

06:58 HIGH INTEREST RATE IS AND WHAT REALLY IS A REALISTIC INTEREST

07:01 RATE WHERE BOND BUYERS GET SOMETHING IN RETURN AND BOND

07:04 ISSUERS HAVE TO PAY FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF OUR OWING MONEY.

07:07 SOUNDS HEALTHY TO US AND WE ARE STOCK GUYS. LISA:

07:12 OK BUT YOU'RE BASICALLY ENDORSING LONG VARIABLE LAGS,

07:15 SEEING IT WORK THROUGH IN THE FORM OF COMMENTARY THAT YOU

07:17 HAVE HEARD FROM THESE COMPANIES. DOES THAT MAKE YOU LESS

07:23 OPTIMISTIC ABOUT TOTAL RETURNS, OR DO YOU SEE THIS AS THE

07:24 MARKET WAKING UP TO WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN SAYING ALL ALONG?

07:26 JOHN: I THINK THE MAYOR -- MARKET IS

07:31 WAKING UP, WHICH IS HIGHLY FLATTERING, BUT YOU DON'T WANT

07:35 TO GET TOO POSITIVE. THE MARKET WILL ALWAYS SHOW YOU

07:38 IT'S LIKE BEING A TIGER TRAINER, DON'T TURN YOUR BACK

07:42 ON THE TIGER, AVOID HUBRIS AT ALL COSTS. LISA:

07:46 SO AFTER THE BELL WE ARE LOOKING FOR APPLE.

07:50 LATER THIS MONTH, THERE'S A REAL QUESTION ABOUT CONSUMER

07:53 FACING TYPES OF TECH NAMES. WE HAVE SEEN REAL DISTRESS,

07:59 MORE DISPROPORTIONATELY IN THE LIKES OF AMAZON.

08:02 HOW MUCH OF A WATER SHIP MOMENT WILL THE APPLE EARNINGS BE

08:04 GIVEN THE ANGST? JOHN: AS YOU KNOW, THEY DON'T LET ME

08:12 TALK ABOUT SPECIFIC STOPS -- STOCKS AT OPPENHEIMER. LISA:

08:14 BUT WHAT MOST PEOPLE USE? JOHN: THEY ARE CAUGHT IN A TRANSITION

08:20 OF GOING FROM A MAJOR PART OF THEIR SALES NOW BEGINNING TO

08:26 DISAPPEAR AS A RESULT OF IDEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES IN THE

08:27 COUNTRY IN MANY WAYS. POLICY IN CHINA.

08:32 THAT IS A NATURAL THING, BUT THEY ARE LED BY TIM COOK, WHO

08:38 HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE A REMARKABLE BUSINESS LEADER.

08:39 STEVE JOBS REALLY PICKED THE RIGHT GUY FOR THE JOB.

08:44 IF A COMPANY HAS AN UNDERSTANDING OF INNOVATION AND

08:48 HOW TO FOSTER IT, WE HAVE COME TO THINK THAT YOU DON'T JUMP TO

08:50 FAST NEGATIVE CONCLUSIONS. ANNMARIE:

08:56 YOU SAY YOU WANT TO LOOK AT INDUSTRY SECTORS, LESS STOCK

08:57 SPECIFICS, BUT YOU STILL LIKE CYCLICALS? JOHN:

09:02 WE DO AND WE THINK YOU NEED TO BE EXPOSED TO TECHNOLOGY, IT'S

09:04 THE BIG STORY HERE AND IT IS ONE THAT IS NOT ONLY SECULAR,

09:09 BUT CYCLICAL AND CAN HELP ALL THE SECTORS. ANNMARIE:

09:14 WHEN WE SEE MOMENTS OF PULLBACK, IS THAT A MOMENT FOR

09:16 YOU TO SAY BY MORE AND GO DEEPER? JOHN:

09:21 WE ARE NOT BIG BUYERS OF THE DIPS, BUT WE ARE BIG BUYERS OF

09:23 BABIES THAT GET THROWN OUT WITH BATHWATER. WE LIKE TECHNOLOGY.

09:31 GARP GROWTH IS THE COMPANY'S DEEPLY EMBEDDED IN THE LIVES OF

09:33 THE CONSUMERS AND BUSINESS. WE ARE ALL ON THE UPGRADE CYCLE.

09:40 WHETHER WE RESIST IT OR NOT, I JUST FOUND OUT THAT ONE OF MY

09:44 PHONES WOULD NO LONGER ADAPT TO THE DELTA AIRLINES APP, SO

09:49 FORTUNATELY -- ANNMARIE: WHY IS THAT? JOHN: TWO OLD.

09:53 JONATHAN: GOT TO UPGRADE. YOU ARE THE PROBLEM WITH APPLE

09:54 EARNINGS. JOHN: I HAVE A 14, 14 FOR BUSINESS.

10:03 FOR PERSONAL I HAD A 6S AND I BEING FORCED TO UPGRADE.

10:06 JONATHAN: OPPENHEIMER PAYS FOR THE NEWER

10:08 IPHONE. I CAN SEE WHAT KIND OF GUY YOU

10:09 ARE, JOHN. [LAUGHTER] YOU SAID SOMETHING INTERESTING

10:14 ABOUT THE OTHER 11 SECTORS. WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT.

10:21 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AI ENABLERS AND AI ADOPTERS.

10:22 WHEN DO WE START TO FOCUS MORE ON THE LATTER AT NOT THE FORMER?

10:38 JOHN: THAT CHANGE IS IMMINENT. AI AS IT EXISTS TODAY IS

10:42 ALREADY HELPING COMPANIES NAVIGATE THE TOUGH TRANSITION

10:45 ENVIRONMENT. JONATHAN: CAN YOU GIVE US AN EXAMPLE?

10:49 JOHN: WHEN YOU SEE VALUE STORIES THAT

10:53 ADAPT AI SUDDENLY BECOME MORE ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS AND YOU

10:58 BEGIN -- WE HAVE ALREADY BEGUN TO SEE VALUE BEGINNING TO

11:00 PERFORM BETTER. IT'S NOT JUST ON THE DEFENSIVE

11:01 POSITION.

11:08 IT'S THE BENEFITS OF THE GROWTH ASPECT OF THE MARKET WITHIN

11:11 SECTORS AND WHAT IT PRODUCES IS BEGINNING TO HELP VALUE.

11:15 JONATHAN: THIS IS BANKS MAKING MORE MONEY

11:20 WITH LESS?

11:22 JOHN: IT IS AND LIKE ANY ADAPTATION

11:26 OF TECHNOLOGY, IT WILL BE NEW JOBS THAT ARE NEEDED.

11:28 HUMANITY, THINK OF THE PRIMITIVE AI WE HAVE TODAY,

11:33 ANYTIME YOU CALL IN TO AN INSURANCE COMPANY OR ANY KIND

11:37 OF A PROVIDER TO GET INFORMATION, YOU HAVE TO FIGHT

11:40 THE AUTO VOICE THAT TRIES TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH THEY VALUE

11:42 YOU AND TRIES TO SELL YOU ALL KINDS OF STUFF. JONATHAN:

11:47 WE WON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A ROBOT AND A PERSON?

11:50 JOHN: WHEN YOU GET TO THE PERSON YOU

11:53 SAY THANK YOU FOR BEING THERE AND TELL YOUR BOSSES THAT THE

11:57 PERSON WHO CALLED REMAINS A CUSTOMER BECAUSE OF YOU, NOT

12:00 THE ROBOT THAT TRIED TO KEEP ME FROM TALKING TO SOMEBODY. LISA:

12:04 I FEEL LIKE WE ARE GETTING AN INTIMATE LOOK AT YOUR PERSONAL

12:07 STRUGGLES. JONATHAN: THIS WAS THE TOOL WITH DELTA

12:09 YESTERDAY. LISA: WHY WON'T YOU LET ME UPGRADE?

12:16 "I'M SORRY, YOU ARE NOT HIGH ENOUGH OF A LEVEL TO TALK TO US

12:19 AS A HUMAN." YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING AND

12:23 TALKING TO CLIENTS, NOT TAKING ANY TIME OFF AT A TIME WHEN

12:26 PEOPLE SAY THAT NOTHING HAS CHANGED.

12:27 WHAT IS KEEPING YOU SO BUSY? JOHN: I WANT TO BE ASSURED THAT

12:33 NOTHING HAS CHANGED. I'M ALWAYS LOOKING FOR

12:34 SURPRISES. 40 YEARS IN THIS BUSINESS, THIS

12:41 WILL BE MY 41ST YEAR, IT JUST TEACHES YOU THAT YOU NEVER KNOW

12:43 WHAT'S COMING AROUND THE CORNER. I WILL NEVER FORGET WHEN

12:49 JONATHAN ASKED ME, IT WAS 2020 SINGH LOOKING BACK WHAT DID YOU

12:52 LEARN AND I TOLD HIM THAT ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.

12:56 SINCE THAT TIME, I HAVE ADDED THAT THE POWER OF A NEGATIVE

13:00 PITCH BOOK CAN BE SIGNIFICANT. REMEMBER, 2022, WE DIDN'T HAVE

13:05 A HUGE SURGE IN UNEMPLOYMENT. WE DIDN'T GO INTO OUR EARNINGS

13:10 RECESSION. WE DIDN'T SEE ALL THE THINGS

13:14 THAT THE BEARS WERE TALKING ABOUT.

13:15 WE JUST GOT THROUGH THINGS. JONATHAN:

13:20 22 WAS A BIG YEAR -- TOUGH YEAR FOR BIG TECH.

13:22 MUCH BETTER YEAR, 23. JOHN, GOOD TO CATCH UP WITH YOU

13:25 ONE DAY AFTER THE FEDERAL RESERVE DECISION.

13:30 S&P FUTURES RIGHT NOW, POSITIVE. GETTING YOU STORIES ELSEWHERE

13:32 WITH YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF.

13:42 >> TENSIONS REMAIN HIGH AS PRO-PALESTINIAN PROTESTS

13:44 CONTINUE ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES. POLICE ARE TAKING ACTION TO

13:50 CLEAR UP ENCAMPMENTS AND CLEAR OUTBUILDINGS, AS DEMONSTRATORS

13:55 ASK FOR SCHOOLS TO CUT TIES WITH ISRAEL.

13:58 THE ASSOCIATED PRESS REPORTED 1600 ARRESTS AT 30 SCHOOLS

14:02 SINCE THE PROTESTS BEGAN AT COLUMBIA IN NEW YORK TWO WEEKS

14:03 AGO. NOVO NORDISK RAISING ITS ANNUAL

14:07 PROFIT OUTLOOK AS MORE PATIENTS GET ON THEIR WEIGHT LOSS DRUG.

14:12 THE DRUGMAKER SAYING MORE THAN 25,000 PATIENTS ARE STARTING ON

14:16 THE TREATMENT EACH WEEK IN THE U.S. COMPARED TO 5000 BACK IN

14:17 DECEMBER. SHARES FELL DURING TRADING IN

14:24 COPENHAGEN BUT HAVE SURGED MORE THAN 25% THIS YEAR.

14:27 SHARES OF CARVANA, SURGING.

14:33 THEY POSTED A NET INCOME OF $49 MILLION.

14:36 ANALYSTS EXPECTED A LOSS OF 160 MILLION DOLLARS.

14:38 VEHICLE SALES GREW FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SIX QUARTERS.

14:43 THE RESULTS COULD BE A SIGNAL THAT THE ONCE NEARLY BANKRUPT

14:46 COMPANY IS MOVING PAST THEIR RESTRUCTURING PLAN AND INTO

14:50 GROWTH. JONATHAN: THANK YOU.

14:52 WE WILL CATCH UP WITH YOU IN ABOUT 30 MINUTES TIME.

14:56 PLENTY OF CONVERSATION AROUND THIS TASK ABOUT NOVO NORDISK.

14:58 DOVISH?

15:03 >> I THINK THE EVIDENCE SHOWS CLEARLY THAT THE POLICY IS

15:05 RESTRICTIVE. DEMAND IS STILL STRONG, THE

15:09 DEMAND SIDE OF THE LABOR MARKET IN PARTICULAR, BUT IT HAS

15:12 COOLED FROM A FEW YEARS AGO. JONATHAN:

15:18 LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY THIS MORNING, GOOD MORNING.

16:06 JONATHAN: I'VE REBOOTED. I THINK.

16:11 EQUITY FUTURES POSITIVE BY 0.6 PERCENT.

16:14 YIELDS LOWER BY A SINGLE BASIS POINT. THE U.S.

16:16 10 YEAR UNDER SURVEILLANCE THIS MORNING, ONE GEAR DOVISH.

16:22 >> I THINK THE EVIDENCE SHOWS CLEARLY THAT POLICY IS

16:24 RESTRICTED. YOU CAN START WITH THE LABOR

16:26 MARKET. DEMAND IS STILL STRONG.

16:32 THE DEMAND SIDE OF THE LABOR MARKET IN PARTICULAR, BUT IT

16:35 HAS COOLED FROM A FEW YEARS AGO AND YOU SEE IT IN JOB OPENINGS

16:39 AND TODAY IN THE JOLT REPORT. STILL HIGHER THAN THE PANDEMIC,

16:42 IT HAS BEEN COMING DOWN. JONATHAN:

16:49 TREASURIES CLIMBING ACROSS THE CURVE WITH JAY POWELL SAYING

16:51 THAT TREASURY IS RESTRICTIVE, DOWNPLAYING THE POSSIBILITY OF

16:52 A RATE HIKE. SAYING THAT WITH AN EXTREMELY

16:58 HIGH BAR FOR TIGHTENING POLICY, THERE IS VALUE OF OWNING THE

17:03 FRONT END, VALUE IN REAL YIELD IN THE U.S. AROUND 2.25.

17:06 CHRISTINA JOINS US FOR MORE. WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THAT NEWS

17:10 CONFERENCE YESTERDAY FROM CHAIRMAN POWELL?

17:17 >> I THINK HE CLOSED THE DALE ON HIKES VERY CLEARLY.

17:21 HE DIDN'T WANT TO ENTERTAIN IT. THE SCENARIO THAT WE STAY ON

17:28 HOLD LONGER AND THESE ARE THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH WE EASE

17:30 WITH A CLOSED DOOR ON THE OTHER SIDE AND IT IS RELEVANT FOR THE

17:31 VALUE ON THE FRONT-END.

17:37 WE WILL BE SPEAKING FROM -- TO ANDREW FROM

17:43 CITI LATER THIS MORNING. HOW LOW IS THE BAR AND WE

17:46 REINTRODUCE A CONVERSATION AROUND RATE CUTS? KRISTINA:

17:52 THE BAR IS HIGHER, POWELL SAID THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO REACT

17:55 TO JUST ONE OR TWO DATA PRINTS, BUT WITH A FEW -- FULL QUARTER

18:00 THEY NEEDED MORE TO CHANGE AND I THINK THERE IS STILL MORE

18:03 FOCUS ON THE INFLATION FRONT. YOU HAVE THREE INFLATION FRONTS

18:08 BEFORE JULY, BUT I THINK YOU HAVE TO HAVE OVERLY CONVINCING

18:11 EVIDENCE THE OTHER WAY. KEN SEPTEMBER BE ON THE TABLE?

18:12 YES. BUT THEY HAVE LOST THEIR CONFIDENCE IN HOW QUICKLY THEY

18:19 WILL BE ABLE TO GET THERE. AGAIN, I DON'T THINK THAT THERE

18:21 IS A CASE FOR HIKES.

18:29 WE THINK THAT THE NEXT POLICY MOVEMENT REALLY GLOBALLY,

18:33 EXCEPT FOR BOJ AS AN OUTLIER IS TO EASE POLICY.

18:35 IT'S DELAYED UNTIL THEY HAVE THE CONFIDENCE. LISA:

18:39 WERE THE HIKES SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE THOUGHT MIGHT BE

18:42 WARRANTED, GIVEN THE INFLATIONARY PRESSURE UNDER THE

18:44 HOOD? KRISTINA: IT FEELS LIKE A BIT OF THE

18:47 FIRST. MARKETS GET EXCITED ABOUT SWINGING FROM ONE EXTREME

18:50 TO THE OTHER. A LOT OF THE CONVERSATION, IF

18:56 YOU HADN'T BEEN HERE AND LISTENED TO THE FED RHETORIC

18:58 AND ALL OF THIS AND WE BOUGHT INTO WHAT HE SOLD US IN

19:03 DECEMBER AND LOOKED AT THE DATA, IT'S HARD TO COME UP WITH

19:09 A SITUATION WHY THEY WOULD NEED TO EASE AS MUCH AS THE MARKET

19:13 WAS PRICING IN JANUARY. BUT I'M NOT SURE THE CASE GOES

19:15 THE OTHER WAY. LISA: THE REASON I ASK IS WE WERE

19:21 PLAYING AROUND WITH THE IDEA OF TAKING OFF THE ASPECT OF A RATE

19:26 HIKE WITHIN EASING BIAS, DESPITE THE HOTTER THAN

19:28 EXPECTED DATA, DOES IT CREATE PLEASURE FOR THE YACHT --

19:31 PRESSURE FOR THE LONG END OF THE YIELD CURVE?

19:34 THE FEELING IS THAT THE FED WANTS TO CUT RATES EVEN IF

19:36 INFLATION IS RUNNING HOT, RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

19:38 PREMIUM YOU HAVE TO CHARGE. KRISTINA:

19:43 THAT HAS BEEN OUR SPOT ON THESIS FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS

19:47 TO NINE MONTHS. THAT IS THE POINT OF THE RATES

19:52 MARKET THAT HAS BEEN MISPRICED AND THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE

19:54 PREMIUM IN THE LONG END. THE CURVE HAS BEEN SO INVERTED.

19:58 THE MARKET HAS GIVEN TREMENDOUS CREDENCE TO THE FED AND ITS

20:03 ABILITY TO FIGHT INFLATION, BUT INFLATION HAS BEEN STICKIER AND

20:06 WE NEED TO SEE HIGHER LONG END YIELDS AND PART OF THE ARGUMENT

20:10 ABOUT THE STEEPER CURVE AS WE SUBSCRIBE TO THE MARKET IS THAT

20:12 IT IS NOT JUST THE FED EASING WITH A SUPER CURVE, IT'S A

20:17 REPRICING OF LONG END YIELDS NEEDING TO BE HIGHER WITH VALUE

20:19 AT THE FRONT-END BECAUSE WE DO NOT SEE THAT CASE.

20:26 LISA: YESTERDAY HE TALKED ABOUT BEING

20:30 AN AGGRESSIVE BUYER BUT NOT THINKING IT WILL GO MUCH ABOVE

20:33 THAT AND THAT IT WILL FRANKLY HOVER AROUND THERE AND AT THAT

20:36 POINT IT CREATES RESTRICTIVENESS IN THE ECONOMY.

20:37 IS THAT HOW YOU VIEW THINGS? KRISTINA: I THINK SO.

20:43 I THINK IN THE FALL THE BOND VIGILANTES GOT EXCITED TALKING

20:47 ABOUT 6.5%, BUT I DON'T THINK THERE IS A CASE FOR THAT.

20:51 WE CAN REPRICE A BIT AROUND 5%. THAT'S WHERE YOU HAVE MORE

20:56 BALANCE IN THE MARKET. YOU ALSO HAVE TO TAKE INTO

21:02 ACCOUNT THAT THERE HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF FLOW INTO

21:04 FIXED INCOME PRODUCTS KEEPING A LID ON YIELDS, EVEN IN SPITE OF

21:11 FISCAL SPENDING, INFLATIONARY CONCERNS, ALL OF VERY TIGHT

21:14 CORPORATE EXPENSE WITH MONEY PUT TO WORK THERE. JONATHAN:

21:19 BALANCE SHEET RUNOFF, IT'S AMAZING THE CUTIE COMES UP AND

21:21 PEOPLE HAVE BARELY TALKED ABOUT IT. WHAT'S GOING ON?

21:28 KRISTINA: I THINK THAT THAT IS BY FED

21:30 DESIGN IN MANY PARTS. THEY HAVE WORKED HARD ON BOTH

21:36 WHERE THE PRIMARY POLICY TOOLS ARE POLICY RATES AND IT'S WHAT

21:38 WE WANT GOING ON IN THE BACKGROUND.

21:40 THEY ARE FAMOUS SAYING THIS IS WATCHING PAINT DRY.

21:46 THE ADJUSTMENT IS A LOT MORE ABOUT FINE TUNING SO THAT WE

21:47 DON'T HAVE BALANCE SHEET ISSUES THE WAY WE DID THAT SEPTEMBER

21:52 IN TERMS OF STRESSING THE MARKET AND TRYING TO EASE IT.

21:56 JONATHAN: I STRUGGLE WITH QE MEANING TO

22:01 BE BULLISH AND CUTIE ISN'T, BUT SOME PEOPLE THEN SAY THAT

22:04 CAPPING IT OFF IS BULLISH AGAIN. I CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT, WHAT IS

22:06 IT MEANT TO MEAN? KRISTINA: I THINK THAT IF YOU GO BACK TO

22:14 THE ECONOMICS CONFERENCE A FEW WEEKS AGO, YOU HAD WAS THAT HE

22:16 AND A FEW OTHER PEOPLE DOING THAT ON THE IMPACT OF QT ACROSS

22:20 THESE MARKETS. THE CONCLUSION IS THAT QT HAS A

22:27 3.25 POINT BASIS IMPACT. BUT THAT IS BY DESIGN.

22:33 THEY TALK ABOUT THE POINT OF -- WALLER SPOKE AFTER, BUT THEY

22:37 TALK ABOUT WHEN WE DO THIS, WE ONLY DO IT WHEN WE THINK IT

22:39 WILL HAVE NO IMPACT ON THE MARKET.

22:41 THAT IS THEIR GOAL IN MANY WAYS. JONATHAN:

22:45 LARGELY PSYCHOLOGICAL, THAT'S WHAT WE ARE SAYING?

22:48 I WE ARE PERCEIVING IT TO BE BASED ON CAMINO CASING FROM

22:54 FOMC -- COMMUNICATION FROM LISA: LISA: FOMC?

22:57 YOUR CONFUSION REFLECTS THAT OF QUANTITATIVE EASING ON THE

23:01 MARKET. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE

23:05 THIS MYSTERY MAKES SENSE BUT IT IS THE REASON WHY YOU HAVEN'T

23:06 SEEN LIQUIDITY DRAINING FROM THE SYSTEM.

23:10 IT HASN'T SHRUNK CONSISTENTLY ENOUGH. JONATHAN:

23:14 WE WILL GET A TON OF FED SPEAK FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS.

23:17 DO YOU THINK THAT CHAIRMAN POWELL REPRESENTS CONSENSUS ON

23:20 THE COMMITTEE, OR DO YOU EXPECT TO SEE DIFFERENCES IN THE DAYS

23:22 TO COME?

23:28 KRISTINA: WE HAVE SEEN A LOT MORE

23:32 DIVERGENCE IN FED SPEAK AND POWELL HAS POSITIONED HIMSELF

23:35 AS ONE OF THE MORE DOVISH MEMBERS.

23:37 EVEN YESTERDAY YOU WERE TALKING A LOT ABOUT LOOKING FOR A

23:40 HAWKISH FED. BUT WE ALREADY MOVED THAT WAY.

23:45 WE HAD TAKEN IT OUT AND THERE WAS NOTHING HAWKISH ABOUT THE

23:47 MESSAGE. SAYING THAT THIS WAS THE DAY

23:50 FOR MARK TO MARKET AND I THINK THAT THE SPEAK WE GET GOING

23:54 FORWARD FROM OTHER MEMBERS WILL BE A LITTLE BIT MORE HAWKISH

23:59 THAN THAT. JONATHAN:

24:00 KRISTINA, THANK YOU. THEY ARE FROM INVESCO.

24:03 HAWKISH RELATIVE TO WHAT? FROM THE LAST MEETING? KIND OF.

24:09 HIGH PRICING? THAT WAS A HIGH BAR, ABSOLUTELY

24:10 NOT. LISA: THIS FROM THE FED PRESIDENT

24:14 THAT CAME OUT AND SAID YEAH, NO, WE ARE CONFIDENT WE ARE ON

24:21 THE RIGHT TRACK. JONATHAN:

24:23 BIG EARNINGS STORY LATER THIS AFTERNOON FROM APPLE.

24:28 ALEX WEBB CATCHES UP WITH INVESTORS AND EARNINGS HITTING

24:29 A SOFT PATCH WITH DIFFICULTIES IN CHINA.

24:45 JONATHAN: SO, HERE ARE THE SCORES POSITED

24:52 BY 0.6% ON THE S&P. ON THE RUSSELL, SMALL CAPS ARE

24:53 UP.

25:00 I ASKED LEST SEE IF IT STICKS BECAUSE YESTERDAY THE S&P 500

25:04 WAS HIGHER BY 1.2% AND INTO THE CLOSE IT WAS NEGATIVE ONE THIRD.

25:07 LISA: DID YOU UNDERSTAND WHY? JONATHAN: NOPE.

25:15 I COULD MAKE UP A NICE LITTLE STORY ABOUT PEOPLE GOING SHORT

25:18 AFTER LISTENING TO HIM SPEAK, BUT THAT WOULD BE BS. [LAUGHTER]

25:20 I HAVE NO IDEA. LISA: I'M SO GLAD, I WAS LOOKING FOR

25:27 A REASON AND I COULDN'T FIND ONE EITHER.

25:28 MAYBE IT WAS THE BANK OF JAPAN STEPPING IN? JONATHAN:

25:34 I WILL TELL YOU THE INCONSISTENCY, IT'S THIS YEAR

25:35 IN THE BOND MARKET. IF THAT HAD FADED AS WELL, OK,

25:41 SOMETHING IS HAPPENING. BUT YIELDS BEING LOWER IN THE

25:43 SESSION, THEY ARE LOWER AGAIN THIS MORNING. LISA:

25:46 STRANGE ON EVERY LEVEL. ANNMARIE:

25:51 WHAT WE HEARD YESTERDAY WAS THAT THE BIGGER RISK WAS TO THE

25:52 LONG END OF THE YIELD CURVE. LISA: IT'S NOT TOO STOCKS.

25:58 STOCKS ARE WHERE THEY WERE BEFORE THE PRESS CONFERENCE.

26:00 THE TAIL RISK WAS WHERE IT WAS BEFORE THE HIKE.

26:03 IT WAS TAKEN OFF THE TABLE. BONDS, IF THEY ARE POTENTIALLY

26:08 MORE EASY THAN PEOPLE THOUGHT, WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR LONG-TERM

26:10 INFLATION? JONATHAN:

26:16 ALAN RUSKIN, YOU CAN MAKE THAT FIVE NOW.

26:22 LISA: THE MOST SINCE THE LAST FED

26:25 MEETING, THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WERE LOOKING AT AND IT GIVES

26:28 YOU A LOOK AT WHAT JAY POWELL CAN DO. JONATHAN:

26:31 WE SAID IT YESTERDAY. THE FX MARKET LOOK LIKE THIS.

26:35 DOLLAR-YEN, 150 532. YESTERDAY WAS JUST AMAZING, 4

26:40 A.M. TO 5 A.M. TOKYO TIME, STAYING UP LATE,

26:44 MAY BE GETTING UP EARLY. PICK ONE.

26:47 THE MARKET MOVED BIG-TIME, GAPPING LOWER BY 3% AT ONE

26:52 POINT, CLOSING LOWER BY 2%. THE BIGGEST MOVE WE HAVE SEEN

26:58 ON DOLLAR-YEN LOWER ALL YEAR. WHAT WE UNDERSTAND IS THAT IT

27:01 BASICALLY COUNTS FOR THE BOJ WITH MORE INTERVENTION. LISA:

27:07 WHICH WAS THEM SAYING THAT JAY POWELL IS A DOVE, LET'S GO,

27:09 LET'S TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY. WHAT WERE THEY TRYING TO

27:12 ACHIEVE, THOUGH? IF THEY WERE TRYING TO STAVE

27:16 OFF WEAKENING, THAT'S NOT GOING TO WORK WITH THAT INTERVENTION.

27:20 IF THEY ARE TRYING TO SQUEEZE OUT SHORTS AND CREATE PAIN TO

27:21 POSSIBLY THREATEN THEM FROM DOING IT AGAIN, MAYBE THAT IS

27:24 WHAT THEY WERE TRYING TO DO? JONATHAN:

27:29 UNDER SURVEILLANCE THIS MORNING, TREASURIES GAINING AS

27:34 JAY POWELL STICKS TO A DOVISH SCRIPT, SAYING IT MAY TAKE MORE

27:37 TIME FOR CURRENT RATES TO LOWER INFLATION WITH TRADERS LOOKING

27:40 AHEAD TO PAYROLLS FROM RULES BE TOMORROW.

27:44 WE'VE GOT MORE DATA COMING THIS MORNING, BY THE WAY.

27:49 TOMORROW MORNING, PAIN LOSS. LISA:

27:54 I AM MORE INTERESTED IN THE DATA AND LESS IN THE FED SPEAK.

27:57 I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY COULD DO TO CHANGE MARKET PERSPECTIVE.

28:01 I WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE ACTUAL WAGE INCREASES, NOT JUST THE

28:03 HEADLINE NUMBERS. GET THE INTERNALS TO UNDERSTAND

28:07 IF THIS IS JUST LOWER QUALITY JOBS BEING ADDED? ANNMARIE:

28:13 I'M MORE INTERESTED IN WHAT MICHAEL HAD TO SAY TO YOU

28:16 YESTERDAY AT THIS TABLE ABOUT IF THEY SEE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE

28:21 4.2, 4.3, IT COULD POTENTIALLY BE ENOUGH FOR THE FED TO SAY WE

28:23 NEED TO GO IN AND MAKE THAT CUT. JONATHAN:

28:31 THERE WAS A HEADLINE ESTIMATE OF 240 IN OUR SURVEY.

28:34 BLOOMBERG REPORTED THAT THE FTC IS SET TO APPROVE EXXON'S

28:38 PURCHASE OF PIONEER. PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH THE MATTER

28:44 SAYING THE DECISION COULD COME WITHIN DAYS, CREATING THE

28:49 LARGEST PRODUCER IN THE PERMIAN BASIS WITH CHESAPEAKE ENERGY

28:53 SHOWING LARGE TAKEOVERS UNDER REVIEW.

28:54 SHOCKER, THEY MIGHT GET A DEAL APPROVED. ANNMARIE:

29:02 AND IN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY, HOSTILE, COMING DOWN

29:06 TO THE FACT THAT EXXON SAYING THEY WON'T ALLOW SCOTT CHEF

29:07 YIELD ON THE BOARD. IF OUR REPORTING IS CORRECT,

29:12 FTC FOUND EVIDENCE THAT HE SOUGHT TO COMMUNICATE WITH OPEC

29:15 MEMBERS WHEN IT CAME TO OIL PRICING AND OUTPUT.

29:19 IF HE IS NOT GOING TO THE ON THE BOARD, IT SET THE PATH FOR

29:21 GREEN LIGHTING THE DEAL. LISA:

29:27 I WONDER IF THE ADMINISTRATION IS HOSTILE ON THE SURFACE BUT

29:32 UNDER THE HOOD VERY HAPPY AND EXCITED ABOUT PRODUCTION, AS IT

29:34 HAS OFFSET GEOPOLITICAL CONCERNS.

29:36 I WONDER HOW MUCH IT IS DELIBERATE AND NOT IN SPITE OF

29:41 HOSTILITY. THAT IT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT

29:44 HOSTILE BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, THEY ARE BEING BAILED OUT.

29:48 JONATHAN: THRILLED ABOUT IT, THE SECRETARY WALKING AROUND WITH A

29:51 BIG SMILE ON THEIR FACE. WON'T TALK ABOUT IT. ANNMARIE:

29:55 SHE DIDN'T MENTION IT TO YOU AT THE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS

30:00 DINNER? JONATHAN: WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THAT.

30:03 WHAT ARE YOU SO HAPPY ABOUT? NOT GOING TO TELL YOU. LISA:

30:07 BUT IT HAS TO DO SOMETHING THAT RHYMES WITH WINEONEER. JONATHAN:

30:14 FOR YOUR FAVORITE NUMBER, LUCKY 13? IT'S AMAZING.

30:16 30 MILLION BARRELS OF OIL PER DAY IN AMERICA.

30:20 MORE THAN SAUDI ARABIA. NO ONE IN THE ADMINISTRATION

30:21 LIKES TO TALK ABOUT IT. ANNMARIE:

30:26 THEY DON'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT A FRONT FACING IN PUBLIC.

30:28 BEHIND THE SCENES SOME OF THEM LIKE TO. LISA:

30:32 IN DAVOS JOHN KERRY SAID SOMETHING HONEST, SAYING THAT

30:37 THIS WAS A POLICY OF NECESSITY, NOT A POLICY OF DESIRE, WHICH

30:40 IS A COHERENT MESSAGE. IF THEY REALLY PUT IT OUT

30:44 THERE, PEOPLE COULD GET AROUND THE FACT THAT THERE WERE

30:48 CERTAIN SACK -- CERTAIN FACTIONS THAT DON'T LIKE IT.

30:50 JONATHAN: THEY WON'T SAY THINGS THAT THE

30:54 AVERAGE PERSON IN AMERICA SAY THAT MAKES SENSE.

30:55 THEY JUST WANT TO ENTERTAIN THE FRINGES. LISA:

30:59 YEAH, BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. THEY ARE SMACK IN THE MIDDLE.

31:02 RACE BECOMES A QUESTION OF WHAT ARE WE DOING RIGHT NOW.

31:05 JONATHAN: WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT

31:07 APPLE, LISA. KEEP UP. INVESTORS LOOKING FOR

31:13 INVESTMENTS IN AI AND DETAILS ABOUT IPHONE SALES.

31:16 THIS MORNING WILL BE FUN, RIGHT? DEMAND IN CHINA, TO.

31:21 THE FIRST OFFICIAL REPORT ON THE VISION PRO.

31:24 ALEX GOT HIMSELF TOGETHER TO JOIN US WITH MORE.

31:28 GOING THROUGH THE EARNINGS REPORT LATER THIS AFTERNOON,

31:29 ALEX, WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR? ALEX:

31:34 CHINA IS WHAT THIS IS GOING TO BE ALL ABOUT.

31:36 EXPECTATIONS ARE PRETTY LOW ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON.

31:38 THERE WERE REPORTS A LITTLE WHILE AGO THAT UNIT SALES HAD

31:43 FALLEN AND THAT THE OVERALL GLOBAL UNIT SALES MIGHT HAVE

31:46 FALLEN BY 10%. THAT DOESN'T CORRELATE WITH

31:50 EARNINGS, OF COURSE, AS APPLE IS OFTEN ABLE TO GET HIGHER

31:55 SALES PRICE PER UNITS THEY SALE -- CELL.

31:56 THERE WON'T BE ANY COMMENTARY AROUND UNIT PRO, NOT EXPECTING

32:03 TO SELL MANY UNITS JUST YET. INVESTORS WOULD LOVE COMMENTS

32:05 ABOUT AI, MOST LIKELY THEY WOULD ISSUE GENERIC COMMENTS

32:09 ABOUT BIG AMBITIONS IN THE SPACE. REAL TIMING BEING AT THE

32:14 WORLDWIDE DEVELOPERS CONFERENCE. LISA:

32:20 LET'S STAY ON THAT WITH THE THEORY THAT SAMSUNG IT'S A LEG

32:23 UP ON THE IMPENETRABLE MARKET BECAUSE THEY WON'T BE COMING

32:27 OUT WITH AN ARLETTE -- ARTIFICIALLY INTELLIGENCE

32:31 INFUSED PHONE THIS YEAR.

32:34 DO YOU THINK THAT APPLE HAS TO GIVE A TIMEFRAME TO GET PEOPLE

32:35 ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE GROWTH? ALEX:

32:40 USUALLY IF THEY ARE ANNOUNCING

32:48 THINGS THAT WWDC, YOU WILL USUALLY BE SEEING SOMETHING

32:50 AROUND WHAT'S COMING SEPTEMBER TIME.

32:54 DEPENDING ON WHAT WE LEARNED THERE, THERE WILL BE A CLEAR

32:56 SENSE OF WHAT'S COMING DOWN THE PIKE.

32:59 BLOOMBERG NEWS HAS FOR ORDER THAT APPLE HAS BEEN IN

33:02 CONVERSATIONS WITH GOOGLE ABOUT USING ITS AI FUNCTIONALITY IN

33:06 SYRIA, IN ITS SMARTPHONES, HIRED WIRED IN, A TACIT

33:11 ADMISSION OF THEIR OWN DEFECTS IN THAT SPACE, WERE IT TO

33:14 HAPPEN. I DON'T THINK NECESSARILY IN

33:16 THIS ONE THAT THEY WILL BE SUCH A SLOW MOVER, THEY MIGHT HAVE

33:18 THIRD-PARTY AGREEMENTS. LISA: I DON'T WANT TO DRAW TOO MANY

33:26 PARALLELS BETWEEN APPLE AND TESLA, TOTALLY DIFFERENT

33:27 COMPANIES, BUT THEY DO BOTH RELY ON CHINA IN SIGNIFICANT

33:30 WAYS. IS IT A SIGNAL FROM ELON MUSK

33:35 THAT HE SNUBBED THE INDIAN PRIME MINISTER AND WENT OVER TO

33:39 CHINA TO TALK WITH JEAN JINPING TO APPEAL FOR BETTER BUSINESS

33:42 OPPORTUNITIES THERE? DO YOU THINK THAT TIM COOK WILL

33:45 TAKE THE SAME APPROACH AT A TIME WHERE HE HAS BEEN

33:48 EXPANDING PRODUCTION AND TALKING ABOUT POTENTIALLY

33:49 TARGETING THAT MARKET?

33:55 ALEX: THE CHALLENGE WITH TALKING ABOUT INDIA, INCLUDING TIM COOK

34:01 AND THE MARKET OF TREMENDOUS PROMISE, THAT PROMISE HASN'T

34:03 BEEN DELIVERED. WE ARE A GOOD FEW YEARS BEHIND

34:09 WHERE CHINA IS RIGHT NOW AND PRICE SENSITIVITY, AVENUE YOU

34:11 HAVE INTIMATED, IS INCREDIBLY HIGH.

34:14 RIGHT NOW IF THEY ARE LOOKING FOR IMMEDIATE EARNINGS, CHINA

34:17 IS A FAR MORE IMPORTANT MARKET FOR THEM.

34:21 CLEARLY, APPLE IS MAKING SLOW INROADS INTO INDIA AND

34:23 GRADUALLY EXPANDING PRODUCTION THERE.

34:26 YOU KNOW, APPLE HAS BEEN IN CHINA MAKING IPHONES SINCE DAY

34:31 ONE, SINCE 2007, WITH A HUGE ECOSYSTEM OF SUPPLIERS THAT

34:34 DON'T EXIST IN INDIA. THERE WILL BE GRADUALLY MORE

34:39 LEANING TOWARDS INDIA, WE WERE EXPECTING THAT, BUT RIGHT NOW

34:40 CHINA IS THE MARKET THAT MATTERS. ANNMARIE:

34:45 QUALCOMM SAID THAT CHINA WAS A BRIGHT SPOT AND WE HEARD FROM

34:48 THE CEO YESTERDAY THAT THEY HAVEN'T SEEN SIGNS OF WEAKNESS

34:51 IN THE ANDROID PREMIUM MARKET IN CHINA.

34:54 HOW MUCH OF A HARBINGER OF BAD NEWS IS THAT FOR APPLE? ALEX:

35:03 THE REAL OPPOSITION IS FROM HUAWEI AND OTHER COMPANIES THAT

35:06 RUN THEIR HANDSETS ON VARIATIONS OF ANDROID.

35:13 THEREFORE, THE COMMENTS FROM QUALCOMM SUGGESTS THOSE SALES

35:15 ARE DOING BETTER, AS WE HAVE NOTICED ALREADY FROM THE

35:18 ESTIMATES AND THESE MARKET SHARE GAINS GLOBALLY IN THE

35:31 ORDER OF 30% FROM XIAO MI IN PARTICULAR, IT'S A GROWING

35:34 SENSE OF PATRIOTISM TOWARDS THE DEVICES YOU ARE BUYING AND YOU

35:36 ARE PROBABLY SEEING THAT IN THE EV MARKET AS WELL. ANNMARIE:

35:42 ALL POINTING TO THE FACT THAT THE DEMAND IS THERE BUT THEY

35:43 HAVE A BRAND ISSUE IN CHINA. HOW DO YOU FIX THAT? ALEX:

35:48 IT'S REALLY CHALLENGING. DON'T FORGET, THIS HAS HAPPENED

35:55 TO APPLE BEFORE, 2016, 2017 WAS A SIMILAR RESURGENCE IN

35:57 PATRIOTISM, APPLE SAW BIG CHUNKS COMING OUT OF THEIR

36:00 MARKET SHARE . SAMSUNG AT THAT TIME ALMOST

36:03 COMPLETELY LEFT THE CHINESE MARKET AND DID A HUGE PIVOT TO

36:07 INDIA IN WHAT MOST PEOPLE RECOGNIZE AS THE BIGGEST

36:12 SMARTPHONE FACTORY IN THE WORLD, SAM SON FACTORY, NOW IN

36:13 INDIA. SO, MAYBE IT IS JUST A QUESTION

36:17 OF PATIENTS? MAYBE THEY NEED TO KEEP

36:21 INNOVATING AND MAKE SURE THAT THE MARKET SEES THEM AS HAVING

36:24 ONE OF IF NOT THE BEST SMARTPHONE ON THE MARKET, BUT

36:27 IT MAY BE A MATTER OF PATIENCE, WRITING IT OUT? JONATHAN:

36:32 THE STOCK IS DOWN YEAR TO DATE AND THERE IS ONE BIG REASON

36:34 THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO BET AGAINST THE NAME THIS YEAR,

36:38 WHAT DID THEY UNVEIL IN SEPTEMBER?

36:43 SO MANY OF US INCLUDING MYSELF, LISA, ANNE-MARIE, WHO HAVEN'T

36:44 UPGRADED FREQUENTLY. IS THAT GOING TO COME IN

36:46 SEPTEMBER? ALEX: LOOK, WE ARE WATCHING FOR OUR

36:52 COLLEAGUE HAS REPORTED ON, A REAL CYNIC WHEN REPORTING THIS

36:53 STUFF. WITH IPHONES RIGHT NOW, WE ARE

36:58 NOT REALLY EXPECTING SIGNIFICANT HARDWARE JUMPS.

37:01 IT'S HARD TO FIND THE BIG INNOVATION ANYMORE.

37:07 THINGS THAT PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO SEE ARE REALLY IN THE

37:10 SOFTWARE WHERE THEY ARE PAYING ATTENTION, WHICH IS WHY THE

37:14 CONVERSATION IS AROUND AI. THAT IS WHAT CONSUMERS ARE

37:16 LOOKING FOR. IT IS ALSO A WAY OF GENERATING

37:20 MORE SERVICES REVENUE. DEPENDING ON THE BUSINESS MODEL.

37:24 WE ARE USED TO MODELS WHERE YOU ARE FRESH EVERY THREE OR FOUR

37:28 YEARS, BUT THEN THEY TRY TO GET MORE SERVICE REVENUE OUT OF

37:32 YOU, RECURRING SPENDING, ON THE WHOLE A HIGHER-MARGIN, WHICH IS

37:37 HOW EVEN AS IPHONE SALES DECLINE, THEY ARE SOMEHOW ABLE

37:39 TO PROP UP REVENUE AND PROFIT.

37:45 JONATHAN: ALEX WEBB, THANK YOU. YOU LOOK SMUG.

37:47 HAVE YOU UPGRADED? LISA: I BROKE MY PHONE, I HAD TO GET

37:50 A NEW ONE. NOT UPGRADE. JONATHAN: YOU GOT A NEW ONE.

37:54 LISA: IT'S NOT A STATUS SYMBOL ANYMORE.

37:58 REMEMBER WHEN IT WAS A STATUS SYMBOL HAVE THE NEWEST THING

37:59 AND MORE CAMERAS? JONATHAN: LISA: LISA: A LUXURY.

38:02 NOW IT'S NOT. NOW IT'S NOT ABOUT SHOWING

38:05 PEOPLE -- I HAVE THIS. JONATHAN: ARE YOU SAYING THAT BECAUSE

38:10 EVERYONE ALREADY HAS ONE? ANNMARIE:

38:14 AT LEAST WE ARE NOT HAVING A 6S, POOR JOHN. LISA:

38:19 HE HAS THE CAPABILITY TO GET ANOTHER ONE. JONATHAN: STUBBORN.

38:25 SOUND OF FEAR AROUND THIS NAME. ONE OF THE REASONS I MENTIONED

38:30 IT, IN SEPTEMBER IF YOU COME UP WITH A BIG UPGRADE AND YOU

38:34 MENTIONED THE WORDS AI, DOES THAT GET PEOPLE TO UPGRADE?

38:37 WE HAVE BEEN SITTING HERE FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS SAYING THERE

38:41 IS THIS BIG STACK OF INDIVIDUALS WITH OLD IPHONES

38:44 THAT ARE READY TO GO, THIS SUPER CYCLE IS COMING AND I'M

38:45 STILL WAITING.

38:51 LISA: IF JOHN IS THE EXAMPLE, HE'S

38:54 NOT GOING TO BUY A PHONE FOR AI, FIGHTING ROBOTS THAT CALL

38:58 HIM. JONATHAN: THAT'S ALL IN THINKING ABOUT

39:01 COMING OUT. FIGHTING ROBOTS. YAHAIRA? YAHAIRA:

39:09 BLOOMBERG REPORTING THAT HUAWEI IS SECRETLY FUNDING

39:11 CUTTING-EDGE RESEARCH AT AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES THROUGH

39:14 AN INDEPENDENT WASHINGTON-BASED FOUNDATION.

39:17 DOCUMENTS AND SOURCES SAYING THEY ARE THE SOLE FUNDER OF A

39:21 RESEARCH COMPETITION THAT HAS AWARDED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND

39:25 ATTRACTS HUNDREDS OF PROPOSALS FROM SCIENTISTS, INCLUDING

39:29 THOSE THAT TOP UNIVERSITIES BANNING THE RESEARCHERS FROM

39:31 WORKING WITH THE COMPANY. THEY ARE CURRENTLY BLACKLISTED

39:36 BY THE U.S. COMMERCE DEPARTMENT. UNSEALED DOJ DOCUMENTS SHOW

39:42 ALPHABET PAID APPLE $20 BILLION IN 2022 TO KEEP GOOGLE AS THE

39:47 DEFAULT SEARCH ENGINE. IT IS THE FOCUS OF THE

39:49 ANTITRUST CASE AGAINST THE TWO TECH GIANTS.

39:56 REGULATORS ALLEGING THAT GOOGLE HAS ILLEGALLY MONOPOLIZED THE

39:57 MARKET FOR ONLINE SEARCH AND ADVERTISING.

40:00 BOTH FIRMS HAD HOPED TO SHIELD THE PAYOUT FROM BEING MADE

40:06 PUBLIC.

40:07 DOJ AND GOOGLE WILL MAKE CLOSING ARGUMENTS TODAY AND

40:09 TOMORROW WITH A DECISION EXPECTED LATER THIS YEAR.

40:14 TESLA IS MAKING MORE COSTS CUTS, THIS TIME WITH INTERNS.

40:20 EV MAKER RESCINDING SUMMER INTERNSHIP OFFERS WEEKS BEFORE

40:21 STUDENTS WERE SET TO BEGIN. THIS COMING AS TESLA UNDERGOES

40:27 MASSIVE JOB CUTS IN SEES A HANDFUL OF EXECUTIVES LEAVE THE

40:28 COUNTRY. IT'S UNLIKELY TO SAVE THEM MUCH

40:36 MONEY, THOUGH, WITH GLASSDOOR SHOWING INTERNS TYPICALLY MAKE

40:37 $18 TO $28 PER HOUR THERE. JONATHAN:

40:40 I FIND THAT STORY REALLY SAD. ARGUABLY HIGHLY QUALIFIED

40:48 INDIVIDUALS THAT MAY HAVE HAD TWO OR THREE, SOME OF THEM

40:50 MIGHT HAVE MORE OFFERS THAN THAT, THEY CHOSE TO GO

40:55 SOMEWHERE, PROBABLY TO GO INTO WORK FOR ELON MUSK AT A PLACE

40:57 LIKE TESLA TO FIND OUT THAT THE JOB IS NOT THERE ANYMORE.

41:03 LISA: AS FOR THE WHY, MAYBE BECAUSE

41:06 THE TOP HUMAN RESOURCES EXECUTIVE JUST LEFT.

41:08 TURN OFF THE LIGHTS WHEN YOU LEAVE. ANNMARIE:

41:11 COULD BE A HUGE TALENT POOL DOWN THE LINE. JONATHAN:

41:13 I'VE FIND IT DREADFUL. LISA: WHO WILL MANAGE THEM?

41:16 THERE ISN'T ANYBODY LEFT. JONATHAN: I HEAR YOU.

41:20 I HEAR YOU. THAT IS THE LATEST ON TESLA.

41:22 NO HINT OF I. -- A HIKE.

41:28 >> NO HINT WHATSOEVER OF A RATE HIKE.

41:31 NO HINT THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.

41:32 HE BASICALLY SAID -- WE GOT IT. JONATHAN:

41:40 THAT CONVERSATION IS UP NEXT. ANDREW SAYS HE THINKS WE GET

41:42 FOUR HIKES THIS YEAR.

41:55 JONATHAN: EQUITY FUTURES ON THE S&P 500,

42:00 POSITIVE BY .7%. YIELDS ARE HIGHER BY 460 ON THE

42:04 U.S. 10 YEAR. NO HINT OF A HIKE THIS MORNING.

42:13 >> WE ARE GOING TO KEEP RATES HERE, UNCHANGED, UNTIL WE ARE

42:14 CONFIDENT THAT INFLATION WILL GET DOWN TO 2%.

42:18 NO HINT WHATSOEVER OF A RATE HIKE.

42:22 NO HINT THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK.

42:25 MARKET REACTION I THINK WAS PRETTY APPROPRIATE, GIVEN WHAT

42:27 HE SAID. HE BASICALLY SAID -- WE GOT IT.

42:30 JONATHAN: WE GET IT. THE FED, KEEPING RATES

42:33 UNCHANGED. JAY POWELL SANG THE NEXT MOVE

42:38 IS NOT LIKELY TO BE A HIKE, BUT AVOIDED OFFERING A TIMELINE FOR

42:39 RATE HIKES.

42:45 ANDREW GIVES US A BASE CASE FOR CUTS IN 2024, MORE THAN PRICED

42:49 BY INTEREST RATE MARKETS. ANDREW, HELLO, LET'S GO

42:53 STRAIGHT TO IT. FORECAST INTO 2024, NOT

42:54 CONSENSUS. ANDREW:

43:00 THE FED CUTTING THIS YEAR, IT WAS CLEAR FROM CHAIR POWELL

43:02 YESTERDAY THAT THE NEXT MOVE IS A CUT AND THE WAY THAT THEY GET

43:04 THERE IS THE INFLATION DATA GIVES THEM THE OPPORTUNITY.

43:09 I DON'T THINK IT WILL GO TO 2%, BUT IT WILL BE SLOW ENOUGH TO

43:13 LET THEM CUT AND THE LABEL MARKET WILL BEGIN A WEAKER.

43:17 WE HEARD THAT FROM CHAIR POWELL, SAYING THAT THE TREND

43:19 IS TOWARDS A WEAKER LABOR MARKET. JONATHAN:

43:23 THIS IS YOUR SIGNATURE CALL, THE WEAKNESS OF THE LABOR

43:24 MARKET. DO YOU SEE IT NOW? ANDREW:

43:28 WHAT WE HEARD FROM CHAIR POWELL IS THAT WITH THE DUAL MANDATES

43:33 IN THE BETTER BALANCE, IN THEIR WORDS, INFLATION HAS COME DOWN.

43:38 NOT 2%, BUT IT HAS COME DOWN. WHEN THEY LOOK AT EMPLOYMENT,

43:42 HE HIGHLIGHTED THESE THINGS, LOOK AT THE CLIMATE BOARD.

43:46 YOU PEOPLE SEE JOBS AS PLENTIFUL OR HARD TO GET?

43:48 THEY SEE IT AS HARD TO GET. IF PEOPLE ARE MORE WORRIED

43:52 ABOUT KEEPING THEIR JOB, THEY ARE MORE WORRIED GO TO THE

43:56 SMALL BUSINESS SURVEY THAT IS COMING OUT TODAY AT 1 P.M., YOU

44:00 ARE SEEING SMALL BUSINESSES SAYING THEY ARE NOT EXCITED

44:03 ABOUT HIRING. THE INDICATORS ARE ALL GOING IN

44:05 ONE DIRECTION. LISA: AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE SEEN

44:11 THE SIGNS OF A CRACK FOR A LONG TIME.

44:15 THEY DID LAST YEAR, THIS YEAR THEY DIDN'T, SO AT WHAT POINT

44:18 DO YOU HAVE CONVICTION THAT IS DIFFERENT? ANDREW:

44:23 I THINK THE CALLS WERE NOT WRONG BUT MORE PREMATURE AND

44:26 THE CYCLE HAS EXTENDED LONGER THOUGHT.

44:29 WHAT WE WENT TO MARKET KIND OF NORMALIZATION.

44:34 -- WAS A KIND OF NORMALIZATION WITH AN INCREDIBLE NEED TO HIRE

44:36 PEOPLE AND RE-STAFF. WE WORKED THROUGH A LOT OF THAT.

44:40 TAKE THE QUICK RATE FROM THE JOLT REPORT.

44:43 THAT'S A DECADE LOW. BUT THAT IS TELLING US IS THAT

44:48 THIS IS NOT JUST NORMALIZATION AT THIS POINT.

44:51 THIS IS PEOPLE IN THE LAST 10 YEARS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN THIS

44:53 WORRIED ABOUT HOLDING ON TO A JOB. LISA:

44:57 RAISING A QUESTION ABOUT TOMORROW'S PAYROLL REPORT AND

45:01 HOW HIGH NUMBERS WILL BE AND HOW I NUMBERS HAVE BEEN.

45:06 THIS IS A ROBUST LABOR MARKET. ARE YOU SAYING THAT THOSE

45:10 NUMBERS INACCURATELY REPRESENT THE NUMBERS THAT ARE SORTED BY

45:14 IMMIGRATION AND OTHER FEATURES THAT MIGHT MASK A REAL LEVEL OF

45:17 WEAKNESS. ANDREW: THAT'S RIGHT.

45:24 U.S. ECONOMISTS HAVE AN INCREDIBLE

45:28 RANGE OF DATA TO DRAW ON WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT DATA TO

45:34 DRAW ON.

45:35 PAYROLLS, THOSE HAVE BEEN STRONG.

45:36 LOOKING AT OTHER LABOR MARKET INDICATORS, THEY RANGE FROM

45:39 SLIGHTLY WEAKER TO A LOT WEAKER. TAKE THE HOUSEHOLD SURVEY, OVER

45:46 THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE COMES FROM . IT'S BEEN MOVING UP.

45:47 IT'S BEEN SOFTER. THE BUSINESS EMPLOYMENT

45:55 DYNAMICS SURVEY, THE NUMBERS JUST CAME

46:00 OUT FROM Q3, 9 MILLION FIRMS ACCOUNTED FOR IN THIS.

46:03 THIS IS THE OFFICIAL DATE ON WHAT FIRMS WERE DOING.

46:07 WE LOST JOBS IN THE THIRD QUARTER.

46:10 I'M NOT SAYING IT HAPPENED, BUT LOOKING AT THE DATA POINTS, YOU

46:13 PLOT THEM TOGETHER TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE TREND. JONATHAN:

46:19 HARD LANDING VERSUS SOFT LANDING, THE STEW THAT IN THE

46:22 AIR FOR YOU, BEEN A LONG NIGHT. SOFT LANDING OVER HERE, HARD

46:26 LANDING OVER HERE. ETC., ETC. WITH RECOVERY, SOUNDS LIKE YOU

46:31 ARE SOMEWHERE OVER HERE. IS THAT FAIR?

46:33 CLOSE TO A HARD LANDING? ANDREW: THAT'S FAIR.

46:38 MARKETS HAVE MOVED AWAY FROM THE SOFT LANDING IDEA.

46:42 IT'S CLEAR FROM INFLATION DATA THAT WE ARE NOT GETTING THE

46:45 SOFT LANDING AND IF ACTIVITY HOLDS UP, WE MIGHT HAVE MORE OF

46:48 AN ISSUE WITH INFLATION. THE REASON I THINK THE FED WILL

46:52 SEE ENOUGH TO CUT IS THE HARD LANDING END OF THE SPECTRUM.

46:56 JONATHAN: MARKET PRICING ECHOING THE

46:58 CONVERSATION WE HAD WITH BERNSTEIN OVER THE LAST WEEK,

47:03 DO YOU SEE THE PRICING OF ONE RATE CUT THIS YEAR AS A

47:05 WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF ONE POSSIBILITY AND NOT THE MOST

47:07 LIKELY OUTCOME? ANDREW: THAT'S RIGHT.

47:14 CHAIR POWELL, WITH HIS MULTI-VERSE OF OUTCOMES

47:16 YESTERDAY, THEY COULD NOT CUT AT ALL, THEY COULD BE CUTTING,

47:20 WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THE ASYMMETRY OF THE REACTION

47:22 FUNCTION. WE DON'T NEED BOTH SOFTER

47:27 INFLATION AND A WEAKER LABOR MARKET, JUST ONE OF THE OTHER.

47:32 LISA: IT'S FASCINATING TO ME THAT YOU

47:36 EXPECT 100 POINTS AND NO SOFT LANDING.

47:38 YOU THINK THE DAMAGE WILL BE DONE ENOUGH THAT 100 POINTS OF

47:44 CUTS WON'T BE ABLE TO GIVE A SURGE OF STIMULUS INTO THE

47:46 ECONOMY SOON ENOUGH TO STAVE OFF A REAL DOWNTURN? ANDREW:

47:51 THIS HAPPENS EVERY MONETARY CYCLE AND THERE IS NO GOOD

47:53 REASON TO THINK THAT THIS ONE WILL BE DIFFERENT.

48:00 HIGHER-THAN-EXPECTED, EVEN IN THE FIRST QUARTER, KEEPING

48:04 POLICY RATES HIGHER FOR LONGER, THE HIGHER FOR LONGER STAGE OF

48:07 THE POLICY CYCLE. AFTER THAT IT'S A WEAKENING OF

48:11 THE LABOR MARKET, GETTING SHARPER AFTER THAT.

48:14 THAT IS WHAT IS PLAYING OUT NOW. JONATHAN:

48:16 HOW UNITED IS THE COMMITTEE ON THE FOMC? ANDREW:

48:23 A LOT OF PEOPLE AROUND THE TABLE RIGHT NOW AND POWELL IS A

48:26 MASTER OF BRINGING TOGETHER ENOUGH TO DO THE PRESS

48:32 CONFERENCE YESTERDAY. JONATHAN:

48:34 ANDREW CI TI, I THINK HE'S ON THE DOVISH

48:35 END OF THE SPECTRUM. LISA: A LOT OF ELEMENTS. GENDER, RACE?

48:42 JONATHAN: SO WEIRD THAT HE RESPONDED THAT

48:43 WAY. TALKING ABOUT GROUPTHINK. THE RISK OF GROUPTHINK AND THE

48:50 LACK OF DISSENT ON THE FOMC FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS.

48:54 HE STARTS TALKING ABOUT GENDER DIVERSITY ON THE FOMC, AND FIND

48:55 THEY DON'T HAVE GROUPTHINK AT THE EURO RESERVE. LISA:

48:59 HE'S A SMART MAN. HE DIDN'T WANT TO ANSWER,. .

49:04 THAT WAS THE ARK UNIT -- AWKWARDNESS. ANNMARIE:

49:08 I WAS TAKEN BACK BY THAT PIVOT. JONATHAN:

49:11 IT WAS A LONG NEWS CONFERENCE. BASED ON HOW THE SHOW HAS

49:15 STARTED TODAY, I CAN'T SPEAK. [LAUGHTER]

49:21 IN THE NEXT HOUR OF "BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE,"

49:41 >>>> I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF RELIEF HERE, THE CHAIRMAN

49:44 STAYING TRUE TO WHAT WE HAVE SEEN FROM THIS CHAIRMAN.

49:48 >> HE HELD BACK AND THAT WAS GOOD, WE HAD SEEN ACCELERATION

49:50 BUT WE HAVE TO SEE WHERE WE ARE GOING.

49:56 >> DOVISH, THE MARKET REACTION WAS APPROPRIATE TO WHAT HE SAID.

49:59 >> IT'S REALLY GOOD FOR THE MARKETS.

50:04 >> THIS STATEMENT IS SOMETHING THE MARKETS WILL LIKE,

50:06 SOMETHING MARCUS WANTED.

50:10 >> THIS IS "BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE." JONATHAN:

50:15 THE MARKET LIKED IT FOR FIVE MINUTES, YESTERDAY, LIKES IT

50:17 MORE THIS MORNING, APPARENTLY. WRAPPING IT UP NICELY THERE

50:25 WITH A STATEMENT AROUND EASING BIAS AND POWELL BELIEVING THAT

50:27 POLICY WAS RESTRICTIVE. THIS IS GOOD FOR THE MARKET,

50:32 LISA. LISA: BASICALLY TAKING THE PROSPECT

50:36 OF A RATE HIKE OFF THE TABLE WAS THE KEY ASPECT THAT CAME

50:38 OUT OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE. GIVEN WHAT WAS PRICED IN, THE

50:44 BAR WAS HIGH FOR A HAWKISH PIVOT. JONATHAN:

50:49 I LIKE THIS FROM PERKINS OVER AT LOMBARD, AN EXERCISE THAT WE

50:51 CAN GO THROUGH FOR THE NEXT ONE HE FOUR HOURS.

50:55 ON TWITTER, X, WHATEVER, CENTRAL MARKETS TAKING A LOT OF

51:02 COMFORT PROVING THAT RULES ARE TIGHTER AROUND A SECOND WAVE.

51:05 THE NEWS CONFERENCE ECHOED THAT. THE ONLY PROBLEM, I THINK, I

51:09 CAN EXPLAIN MOST OF THAT REBOUND WITHOUT REFERENCE TO

51:13 MONETARY POLICY, WHICH IS WHAT MOST HAVE DONE FOR SEVERAL

51:17 MONTHS. LISA: SUPPLY-SIDE IN TERMS OF

51:19 IMMIGRATION FILLING THE JOBS THAT WOULD HAVE HAD TO HAVE

51:20 BEEN FILLED WITH PEOPLE IN THE QS WHO WOULD CHARGE MORE MONEY

51:26 AND YOU WOULD SEE MORE WAGE INFLATION.

51:29 IT CREATES THE QUESTION WHAT IS MONETARY POLICY DOING.

51:30 JAY POWELL HAS ASKED THIS, WHERE'S THE CON'S THAT IT'S

51:33 RESTRICTIVE? -- WHERE'S THE CONFIDENCE THAT

51:38 IT IS RESTRICTIVE? ANNMARIE:

51:45 IMMIGRATION IS FUELING THE REBOUND IN RICH ECONOMIES.

51:48 THAT'S WHAT THEY BOILED IT DOWN TO WITH THE SUPPLY-SIDE LABOR

51:52 MARKET. UBS HAS PULLED DOWN THE TALKS

51:53 ON INFLATION, HOW THE FED TALKED ABOUT THEIR PROGRESS IN

51:57 THAT YEAR OF 2% TARGET. THEN HE SAYS, IT'S HIGHER TO

52:02 KNOW WHAT HIGHER FOR LONGER IS SUPPOSED TO ACHIEVE IN TERMS OF

52:09 MEDICAL INFLATION AND THE LABOR MARKET FOLKS HAVE BECOME MORE

52:15 IMPORTANT. JONATHAN: MORE CLAIMS EASTERN TIME.

52:18 HERE'S THE ESTIMATE, PREVIOUS WEEK 207.

52:21 GOING INTO TOMORROW, 240 IS THE ESTIMATE IN OUR SURVEY.

52:27 THE PREVIOUS NUMBER, THE THREE-MONTH AVERAGE, 370, 280,

52:30 WE ARE LOOKING FOR ANOTHER 240 TOMORROW. LISA:

52:35 I WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT HE SAID MORE.

52:40 THE HIGHER NUMBERS IN TERMS OF THE JOBS CREATED, MASKING

52:43 WHAT'S GOING ON UNDERNEATH. IT'S A LOT OF WEAKNESS THAT

52:44 COULD MOVE QUICKLY AND FORCE THE FED TO 100 BASIS POINTS.

52:52 STAVING OFF A SERIOUS DOWNTURN. IT'S COUNTER CONSENSUS WITH AN

53:00 INCREDIBLE LOGIC THAT EXPLAINS THE SURVEYS WE'VE BEEN GETTING.

53:04 JONATHAN: WALMART, STARBUCKS, MCDONALD'S,

53:07 HOW MUCH WEIGHT DO YOU PUT ON THAT?

53:09 HOW MUCH WEIGHT DO YOU PUT ON THE IDEA THAT THE CONSUMER IN

53:13 AMERICA IS STARTING TO STRUGGLE? LISA: NOT ONLY STARBUCKS AND

53:20 MCDONALD'S, IT COULD BE THE PROTESTS, SHIFTING CAVEATS,

53:23 COMPETITION IS A DOLLAR LATTES, BUT COMPETITION OVER AMAZON AND

53:27 OTHER COMPANIES SAYING IT'S CLEAR THAT CONSUMERS ARE BEING

53:30 PRICE-SENSITIVE.

53:37 IT SEEMS LIKE A THEME, IF YOU LOOK AT THE BEIGE BOOK.

53:42 ANNMARIE: ALL OF THESE CONSUMERS ON THE

53:46 LOWER END OF THE SOCIOECONOMIC SCALE MOVING FROM THE SHADOWS

53:49 OF THE ECONOMY INTO THE SUN TO GET BURNED BY INFLATION, THAT

53:50 IS WHAT THE CORPORATIONS ARE TALKING ABOUT. JONATHAN:

53:55 THAT IS WHERE THE >> ARE, POSITIVE BY 0.7%.

54:00 YESTERDAY'S RALLY FADED ON THE S&P 500, ENDING IN NEGATIVE

54:05 TERRITORY. BOND MARKET YIELDS PULLING BACK

54:08 IN YESTERDAY'S SESSION, DOWN BY TWO OR THREE BASIS POINTS.

54:14 COMING UP THIS HOUR, WE WILL CATCH UP WITH ASSET MANAGEMENT

54:19 AS JAY POWELL KEEPS THE DOOR OPEN TO RATE CUTS.

54:22 STANDARD CHARTERED, MORE SPECULATION ON YEN INTERVENTION.

54:27 AND ALSO WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE HIGH BAR OF THE YIELD REACHING

54:29 10%. STICKING TO SCRIPT, JAY POWELL

54:33 MAINTAINS A DOVISH BIAS.

54:39 THE PRINCIPAL ASSET MANAGER -- FROM PENCIL -- PRINCE WILL

54:42 ASSET MANAGEMENT THEY WRITE THAT IT'S BEEN FUELING MARKET

54:46 OPTIMISM, " ALSO SUPPORTING A BROADENING OF

54:49 THE MARKET RALLY AS RATE CUTS COME CLOSER INTO SITE."

54:51 LET'S GO STRAIGHT INTO THAT. BROADENING THE MARKET RALLY, WE

54:58 HEARD THE SMALL CAPS GOT SMOKED IN THE MONTH OF APRIL.

55:00 WHY DOES IT CHANGE THIS MONTH?

55:03 >> I DON'T THINK IT NECESSARILY DOES THIS MONTH, THE KEY POINT

55:09 IS THAT AS THEY COME INTO SIGHT, FOR SMALL CAPS TO HAVE A

55:12 SUSTAINED RALLY, YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT RATE CUTS ARE AROUND

55:14 THE CORNER AND ARE CERTAIN OF THAT.

55:17 POWELL WAS DOVISH YESTERDAY, BUT AS YOU LOOK AT THE STRENGTH

55:23 OF THE ECONOMY, THEY CAN'T HAVE REAL CONFIDENCE THAT RATE CUTS

55:24 ARE IMMINENT BY ANY MEANS. IT WILL TAKE A COUPLE OF MONTHS

55:31 AFTER WHAT WE EXPECTED FOR THE SMALL-CAP TO BROADEN OUT IN

55:32 MATERIALIZE. JONATHAN:

55:39 LISA MENTIONED THIS, TALKING ABOUT EMBRACING THE HARD

55:42 LANDING AND NOT A SOFT ONE, ANDREW SAID.

55:44 WHY THE LATTER AND NOT THE FORMER? SEEMA:

55:53 I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE CRACKS WARMING AND THERE ARE TWO

55:54 PLACES YOU CAN LOOK AT FOR THEM TO COME THROUGH.

55:58 ONE, AS YOU SAID, ON THE LOWER INCOME SIDE OF CONSUMERS.

56:01 COMING THROUGH IN A LOT OF THE EARNINGS DISCUSSIONS.

56:06 DIPPING INTO THAT CREDIT CARD DATA AS WELL.

56:11 ON THE SMALL SIDE, TYPICALLY

56:20 FOR A BROADER, WE CAN SEE THOSE CRACKS FORMING, SO WE EXPECTED

56:23 DOWNSHIFT, BUT NOTHING BELOW TREND.

56:25 STILL A SOFT LANDING FOR 24 AND 25. ANNM

56:31 LISA: IF ANDREW IS RIGHT AND WE GET A

56:35 PROTRACTED WEAKENING, WHAT DOES IT DO TO YOUR THESIS? SEEMA:

56:39 IT CHANGES ENTIRELY. AT THE MOMENT WE ARE EXPECTING

56:45 THE UNEMPLOYMENT RAYS TO RISE -- RATE TO RISE SLIGHTLY, DOWN

56:46 TO SUPPLY. IF IT RISES TO A 5% LEVEL,

56:52 THAT'S A WORRY.

56:58 IF YOU SEE THE SPIKE THE WAY ANDREW IS TALKING ABOUT, YOU

57:03 WOULD GET AGGRESSIVE RATE CUTS. THAT IS NOT OUR SCENARIO AT

57:05 THIS POINT IN TIME. LISA: THE ECONOMIC PICTURE, HIGHLY

57:10 UNCERTAIN AND THERE IS THAT QUESTION AROUND WHICH DATA IS

57:14 RELEVANT OR COMPARABLE, BUT IT IS NOT CLEAR HOW TO HEDGE

57:18 AGAINST CERTAIN DOWNSIDE RISKS WITH HIGHER INFLATION AND

57:20 RECESSION. WHAT IS THE BEST HEDGE FOR YOU?

57:26 SEEMA: AT THIS POINT IN TIME WHAT WE

57:29 HAVE SEEN IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS WITH INFLATION DATA, IS

57:35 A TIMELY REMINDER FOR NESTERS ACROSS THE PORTFOLIO -- NOT

57:38 SAYING PLUG EVERYTHING INTO IT, BUT THEY NEED TO TAKE

57:44 SIGNIFICANT, OR AT LEAST A OF YOUR PORTFOLIO.

57:47 STUFF LIKE REAL ESTATE, COMMAND, DOING WELL IN HIGH

57:48 INFLATION YEARS. THERE HAS TO BE MITIGATION TO

57:53 HAVE DOWNSIDE PROTECTION. ANNMARIE: IT'S NOT JUST THE U.S.

57:57 HITTING RECORD HIGHS. WHERE ELSE DO YOU LIKE AROUND

57:59 THE WORLD? SEEMA: IT'S INTERESTING, TYPICALLY WE

58:04 BELIEVE IN U.S. EXCEPTIONALISM, BUT RIGHT NOW

58:09 AT THE U.S. THERE ARE A LOT OF UNCERTAINTIES AND WE DON'T KNOW

58:10 THE RATE PROFILE. THE GROWTH PROFILE IS NOT

58:17 REALLY LOOKING AT UPSIDES, WE ARE LOOKING FOR DOWNSIDE

58:19 SURPRISES. AND VALUATION IS EXPENSIVE.

58:26 AT THIS POINT IN TIME THERE ARE INCREASING OPPORTUNITIES

58:29 OUTSIDE THE U.S. VALUATIONS ARE FAIRLY

58:31 ATTRACTIVE, YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE UPSIDE SURPRISES COMING.

58:37 WE ARE FAIRLY SURE ON RATE CUTS. FOR EXAMPLE, LOOKING TOWARDS

58:43 MARKETS, LATIN AMERICA IS ATTRACTIVE TO US AS WELL AS

58:45 PLACES LIKE INDIA, ALSO JAPAN. ANNMARIE:

58:49 HOW MUCH HAS THE FED IN THIS PROLONGED POTENTIAL CUT MADE IT

58:52 DIFFICULT FOR THESE OTHER ECONOMIES? SEEMA:

58:56 YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CERTAIN OF THEIR ECONOMIC STRENGTH WITH A

58:58 STRONG DOLLAR. AN ECONOMIC IMPACT, YOU HAVE TO

59:04 BE SOMEWHAT SELECTIVE. THERE ARE SEGMENTS OF ASIA THAT

59:11 HAVE STOPPED THEIR RATE CUTTING PROCESS, SLOWED IT DOWN, WE

59:12 WANT TO AVOID THOSE.

59:15 IDEALLY, YOU HAVE SOME EXPOSURE TO DRIVERS KEEPING MOMENTUM

59:22 GOING. JONATHAN: GOOD TO HEAR FROM YOU, LOOKING

59:27 FORWARD TO CATCHING UP IN NEW YORK THE NEXT TIME YOU ARE

59:29 AWARE. BREAKING DOWN THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR

59:32 MARKETS. SPEAKING OF CRACKS IN THE

59:39 MARKET, PELOTON CUTTING IN HALF. THE CEO IS STEPPING DOWN.

59:43 THEY ARE CUTTING GLOBAL HEADCOUNT BY PERCENT.

59:48 THE OUTLOOK FOR EARNINGS, THE FULL-YEAR ADJUSTED LOSS IS 5

59:53 MILLION TO 20 MILLION, 62.9. ANNMARIE:

01:00:02 IT'S A -- -- LISA:IT'S A TOTAL BEAT, THERE.

01:00:07 HERE'S THE QUESTION, IS THIS A POST-PANDEMIC USER?

01:00:08 BASICALLY EVERYONE GOT THE BIKES DURING THE PANDEMIC,

01:00:13 NEEDED EXERCISE AND COULD LEAVE HOME.

01:00:15 THEY ENDED UP, WHO WAS IT, MR. BIG CAME OUT AND SAID --

01:00:19 JONATHAN: HEART ATTACK? HE DIED ON THE PELOTON? "SEX"

01:00:23 REBOOT? ANNMARIE: THE REBOOT. LISA: THE BRANDING, IT FAILED.

01:00:31 JONATHAN: PELOTON FAILED OR THE REBOOT

01:00:33 FAILED? THAT FAILED, TOO. LISA: I HAVE USED DEVELOPED ON, I

01:00:37 ENJOYED IT. BUT THERE'S A REAL QUESTION OF

01:00:40 WHETHER THIS IS REPRESENTATIVE OF A BROADER TREND OR A

01:00:42 SPECIFIC STORY. ANNMARIE: YOU WENT OUT AND GOT ONE

01:00:45 QUESTION MARK I DIDN'T DO THAT. LISA: ANNMARIE: I DID NOT.

01:00:49 SOUNDED LIKE YOU DID. [LAUGHTER] FEELS LIKE THEY ARE UNWINDING.

01:00:55 A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A BIG WINNER WHEN LIFE

01:00:57 GOT BACK TO NORMAL. THEY ARE ALSO REDUCING RETAIL

01:00:59 SHOWROOM. GO TO THE STORES TO ATTRACT NEW

01:01:06 CUSTOMERS, TRY THEM OUT. THAT SEEMS TO BE UNWINDING AS

01:01:07 WELL. LISA: 15% OF GLOBAL HEADCOUNT, RIGHT?

01:01:13 WHAT GOES FIRST? YOU CUT JOBS. HOW MANY COMPANIES ARE THERE

01:01:16 LIKE THIS THAT TILT UP WITH MUCH BIGGER FOOTPRINTS THAN THE

01:01:19 BUSINESS MODEL COULD HANDLE? IT'S THE WASHOUT RUSSIAN OF DO

01:01:27 YOU GET MORE OF THIS -- THE WASHOUT QUESTION OF DO YOU GET

01:01:29 MORE OF THIS? JONATHAN: FOR THE TECH SESSION, AND THE

01:01:36 OTHER FIRMS AS WELL, THROW IN THE DEBT.

01:01:40 MINDFUL OF THE TIMING AROUND BANKS WITH REFINANCING

01:01:43 STRATEGIES GOING FORWARD FROM HERE, WE WILL HEAR A LOT MORE

01:01:46 OF THAT. ANNMARIE: IT'S THE REASON -- LISA: IT'S

01:01:49 THE REASON IF YOU HAVE COMPANIES BUILDING UP ON CHEAP

01:01:54 FINANCING, WHAT SURVIVES UNTIL 25? WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT

01:01:59 WHOLESALE DOWNTURNS OR A WAVE OF DEFAULTS AS MUCH AS SIMPLY

01:02:03 SEEING A GREATER PACE OF DEFAULTS OF COMPANIES THAT

01:02:04 CANNOT SURVIVE. ANNMARIE: NOW I KNOW WHERE YOU MAY HAVE

01:02:10 TRIED ONE, THEY ANNOUNCED AN AGREEMENT TO PUT THEM IN HYATT

01:02:12 HOTELS. THE ONES THEY CAN'T SELL.

01:02:16 JONATHAN: I WISH JOHN WAS HERE TO TELL US

01:02:21 THAT HE HAS AN IPAD TIED TO A BIKE, HE WON'T GET A PELOTON.

01:02:25 LISA: NOT IPAD. IPHONE THE SUCCESS.

01:02:32 -- IPHONE 6S. [LAUGHTER] JONATHAN:

01:02:36 PELOTON, POSITIVE BIKE FOR PERCENT. HERE'S YAHAIRA.

01:02:41 YAHAIRA: UNSEALED DOJ DOCUMENTS SHOW

01:02:45 ALPHABET PAID $20 BILLION IN 2022 TO KEEP GOOGLE AS THE

01:02:49 DEFAULT SEARCH ENGINE IN THE BROWSER.

01:02:54 IT'S THE FOCUS OF THE DOJ ANTITRUST CASE AGAINST THE TECH

01:02:56 GIANTS. GOOGLE ILLEGALLY MONOPOLIZING

01:02:59 THE MARKET FOR ONLINE SEARCH AND RELATED ADVERTISING.

01:03:06 DOJ AND GOOGLE WILL OFFER CLOSING ARGUMENTS TODAY AND

01:03:14 TOMORROW.

01:03:15 GOOGLE REPORTING THAT THE FTC IS LOOKING INTO AN ACQUISITION

01:03:19 OF PIONEER. PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH THE MATTER

01:03:23 SAYING THE DECISION COULD COME WITHIN DAYS, MAKING THE LARGEST

01:03:26 PRODUCER WITHIN THE PERMIAN BASIN.

01:03:28 CHESAPEAKE AND PERMIAN STILL HAVE LARGE TAKEOVERS UNDER

01:03:32 REVIEW. THE U.S. MEAT SUPPLY IS SAFE ACCORDING

01:03:35 TO THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.

01:03:39 ALL SAMPLES OF RETAIL GROUND BEEF COLLECTED FROM U.S.

01:03:44 STATES TESTED NEGATIVE FOR THE H5N1 INFLUENZA VIRUS.

01:03:48 TAKEN FROM RETAIL OUTLETS IN STATES WHERE DAIRY CATTLE HAD

01:03:50 TESTED POSITIVE FOR BIRD FLU.

01:03:57 JON? JONATHAN: "AND JUST LIKE THAT,"

01:04:02 THAT IS WHAT THE REBOOT WAS CALLED. ANNMARIE:

01:04:04 I LIKE TO THE CLOTHES. JONATHAN: NO WORRIES.

01:04:09 UP NEXT, TENSION FOR THE JEEP -- BOJ.

01:04:16 >> EITHER IT IS NOT AS STRONG AS IT SOUNDS OR MONETARY POLICY

01:04:20 IS THE BETTER MOVE, AND MORE LIKELY IT'S THE LATTER.

01:04:26 JONATHAN: MORE SIGNS OF INTERVENTION

01:04:27 OVERNIGHT. THAT CONVERSATION, UP NEXT.

01:05:17 JONATHAN: YOU JUST MISSED THREE MINUTES

01:05:19 ON CARRIE BRADSHAW. THAT'S A GOOD THING.

01:05:23 EQUITY FUTURES RIGHT NOW ON THE S&P, POSITIVE I .75%.

01:05:32 A BREAK OF 4.5996. UNDER SURVEILLANCE THIS

01:05:36 MORNING, TENSION AT THE BOJ.

01:05:41 >> THERE IS TENSION BETWEEN THE BOJ GOVERNOR COMING OUT TO SAY

01:05:45 THAT MONETARY POLICY IS NOT DRIVEN BY THE EXCHANGE RATE.

01:05:51 EITHER THE POLICY STATEMENT ISN'T AS STRONG AS IT SOUNDS,

01:05:56 OR THE INTERN -- INTERVENTION ISN'T ULTIMATELY GOING TO WORK.

01:06:00 I THINK IT IS MORE LIKELY THE LATTER. JONATHAN:

01:06:06 ADAM SITTING DOWN WITH DANI BURGER FOR A FANTASTIC EXCHANGE

01:06:08 EARLIER THIS MORNING. A SECOND ROUND OF CURRENCY

01:06:15 INTERVENTION THIS WEEK, THE YEN SEES A SHARP GAIN.

01:06:21 MOMENTS AFTER THE NEWS CONFERENCE WITH CHAIRMAN

01:06:24 POWELL, UNDER STANDARD CHARTERED THEY WROTE THAT THEY

01:06:28 MAY HAVE TROUBLE RETAINING THE GAINS.

01:06:32 BOJ RATE POLICY ADDING SUPPORT TO THE INTERVENTION.

01:06:40 CAN WE START WITH THE INTERVENTION, STEVE?

01:06:43 WHAT'S THE STRATEGY FROM JAPANESE AUTHORITIES AND THE

01:06:45 ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE? WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE

01:06:47 APPROACH SO FAR? STEVE: THEY MAY HAVE THOUGHT THAT THEY

01:06:51 WERE GOING TO CATCH THE MARKET ON THE HOP WITH THE DOLLAR

01:06:57 WEAKER ALREADY, SLIGHTLY MORE DOVISH THAN EXPECTED WITH THE

01:06:59 FOMC MEETING.

01:07:06 THE MEETING, THE YEN WAS MOVING AT 4 P.M.

01:07:12 NEW YORK TIME, IT'S A THIN MARGIN.

01:07:17 I THINK THEY WERE EXPERIMENTING WITH TRYING TO SEE WHETHER THEY

01:07:22 COULD CREATE A MARKET DYNAMIC BY HAVING PEOPLE WHO SERVE

01:07:27 SUDDENLY , SAY THEY BOUGHT THE YEN AT 1.56, P&L IN THE RED,

01:07:30 CUTTING POSITIONS. TAKING PROFIT, THERE

01:07:36 INTERVENTION WOULD CREATE A MARKET DYNAMIC TAKING THE YEN

01:07:40 FURTHER DOWN. OVERALL, I WOULD SAY THAT THE

01:07:45 REVIEWS ARE MIXED TO SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE.

01:07:48 MAYBE 4.5 ON THE ROTTEN TOMATOES SCALE. JONATHAN:

01:07:51 I WANTED TO GET INTO THAT DEEPER.

01:07:54 HOW DO YOU THINK THE SCALES IDENTIFIED SUCCESS?

01:08:00 STEVE: THEY WOULD HAVE DEFINED IT AS

01:08:05 HAVING THE YEN STAY AT THE LOWS, SEE SOME MARKET

01:08:12 FOLLOW-THROUGH IN TERMS OF INVESTORS AND OTHERS SAYING

01:08:14 THAT WE HAD A GOOD RUN, TIME TO STOP IT.

01:08:18 I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE CASE. I THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME WHO

01:08:22 THINK THAT THIS IS A GOOD LEVEL TO PURCHASE DOLLAR-YEN AT. LISA:

01:08:28 IS THERE AN IDEA THAT JAPANESE AUTHORITIES ARE TRYING TO

01:08:31 PUNISH A LITTLE BIT THE SHORT-SELLERS THAT MIGHT HAVE

01:08:34 GOTTEN SQUEEZED OUT AND HURT A BIT IN THE OVERNIGHT ACTION?

01:08:38 POTENTIALLY ONE OF THE GOALS AT A TIME WHERE IT DOESN'T SEEM

01:08:41 LIKE THEY CAN ACHIEVE PRICE STABILITY OR TRUE STRENGTH?

01:08:45 STEVE: THESE ARE BIG BOYS WHO KNOW

01:08:47 WHAT THEY ARE DOING AND KNOW WHAT THE BANK OF JAPAN HAS BEEN

01:08:50 SAYING. IF YOU GO SHORT ON DOLLAR-YEN

01:08:57 -- SORRY, LONG ON DOLLAR-YEN, YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED FOR

01:09:01 INTERVENTION AND HAVE A RISK STRATEGY.

01:09:04 SOMETHING THAT SAYS I WILL GET HERE AND OUT HERE AND BE THE

01:09:06 BETTER FOR IT. I DON'T THINK THE PUNISHMENT

01:09:07 WAS OVERWHELMING. THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN

01:09:13 OVERWHELMED BY FOUR OR FIVE DAYS OF PROFITS.

01:09:18 NORMALLY, I WOULD SAY THIS ISN'T ENOUGH FOR A LASTING

01:09:26 IMPACT. LISA: ALAN RUSKIN OF DEUTSCHE BANK

01:09:31 JUST PUT OUT A NOTE THAT THEY ARE SPEAKING TOWARDS THE

01:09:33 INTENTIONAL CONSEQUENCE HERE OF THE ACTIONS OF THE BANK OF

01:09:36 JAPAN IN TERMS OF CREATING EXTRA VOLATILITY, WHICH IS WHAT

01:09:38 MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO DO THE CARRY TRADE'S MOVING AGAINST

01:09:40 THE YEN. IS THERE SOME TRUTH THAT, A

01:09:47 JAPAN THAT WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE VOLATILITY IN ITS CURRENCY

01:09:50 IN THE U.S. DOLLAR SOME PLEA TO PREVENT

01:09:51 SPECULATIVE TRADING? STEVE:

01:09:52 YOU KNOW, I THINK THEY CAN CREATE VOLATILITY ANY DAY OF

01:09:59 THE WEEK. WHETHER THEY CAN KEEP IT GOING

01:10:05 FOR AN EXTENDED AMOUNT OF TIME, WHICH IS WHAT WOULD MATTER FOR

01:10:09 THE CARRY TRADE'S, THAT'S A DIFFERENT QUESTION.

01:10:13 YOU OFTEN FIND THAT INVESTORS INTERVENE YESTERDAY, PROBABLY

01:10:15 WON'T TODAY. YOU SEE THINGS DROP.

01:10:19 THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN THE CASE OVERNIGHT, BUT THE KEY IS

01:10:25 WHETHER THEY CAN KEEP THE VOLATILITY HIGHER FOR A SHORT

01:10:28 TIME. I THINK THE MARKET WILL NOT BUY

01:10:31 INTO THAT LIST ACS IN PRACTICE, MEANING REPEATED EPISODES OF

01:10:36 INTERVENTION. JONATHAN: UNLESS THE BOJ GOES ON A RATE

01:10:40 HIKING CYCLE THE LIKES OF WHICH WE HAVEN'T SEEN FOR A LONG

01:10:43 TIME, DO YOU THINK THEY WILL GET TO HELP ANYTIME SOON?

01:10:47 REPEATING THE CONVERSATION WE HAD THIS SUMMARY HERE FROM THIS

01:10:51 MORNING FOR ANDREW WAS LOOKING FOR FOUR CUTS IN 24.

01:10:57 CERTAINLY AGAINST THE GRAIN AND WHAT'S PRICED BY CONSENSUS.

01:11:01 WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR FROM CHAIRMAN POWELL AND WILL IT BE

01:11:03 SUFFICIENTLY GOOD ENOUGH TO HELP THE LIKES OF JAPAN AND THE

01:11:05 JAPANESE YEN? STEVE:

01:11:11 WE ARE LOOKING FOR TWO CUTS, WE ARE NOT AS FAR ON THE DOVISH

01:11:14 SIDE AS ANDREW IS, BUT WE THINK THAT BASICALLY WHAT THE CHAIR

01:11:19 WAS SAYING YESTERDAY WAS HE WOULD LIKE TO CUT IF HE COULD

01:11:24 AND IS PERFECTLY HAPPY, YOU KNOW, IF HE DOESN'T HAVE TO, IF

01:11:29 HE CAN KEEP STABLE, AND IS TERRIFIED OF ANY MENTION OF

01:11:32 RAISING RATES AT THIS STAGE. YOU KNOW, WE THINK THAT THERE

01:11:37 IS A GOOD ENOUGH CHANCE THAT INFLATION WILL SLOW DOWN IN THE

01:11:39 SECOND QUARTER AS IT DID LAST YEAR.

01:11:48 A CUT THREE AND A CUT IN Q4, BUT IT IS NOT GUARANTEED.

01:11:52 THERE IS MORE UNCERTAINTY AROUND WHETHER INFLATION HAS

01:11:59 PLATEAUED OR IF IT WAS JUST SEASONALITY AND YOU CANNOT GET

01:12:02 OUT OF THESE INFLATION NUMBERS. THE REST OF THE YEAR WILL BE

01:12:03 MORE FRIENDLY. JONATHAN:

01:12:09 ARE YOU PREPARED TO SAY 106 IS THE PEAK ON THE U.S. DOLLAR?

01:12:16 STEVE: NO. WE THINK THE EURO IS GOING TO

01:12:18 103.

01:12:25 NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE THE FED WILL BE HAWKISH, BUT EVERYONE

01:12:30 OUTSIDE OF JAPAN SEEMS DETERMINED TO CUT RATES AS MUCH

01:12:31 AS THEY CAN. THE IMPLIED COMMITMENTS OF THE

01:12:41 ECB AND OTHER CENTRAL BANKS ARE MUCH STRONGER THAN ANYTHING THE

01:12:43 FED SAID ON THE OTHERS. DOLLAR, STRONGER THROUGH THE

01:12:48 END OF THE YEAR. MAYBE BY 2025 WE GET SOME CATCH

01:12:52 UP. JONATHAN: STEPHEN, APPRECIATED.

01:13:02 EURO-DOLLAR, 107, ULTIMATELY LOOKING FOR 103 ON THAT

01:13:03 CURRENCY PAIR. THE ECB SEEMS TO HAVE MORE

01:13:06 CONVICTION AGAINST THE FEDERAL RESERVE. LISA: DRAMATIC MOVES.

01:13:11 103 BREAKS OUT. JONATHAN: WILL TAKE IT. LISA:

01:13:17 IT SPEAKS OF THE MOMENT WE ARE IN, NOTHING HAS CHANGED

01:13:18 DRAMATICALLY. NO ACTION, PEOPLE ARE LOOKING

01:13:21 FOR A COMPASS. IT'S A BOLD CALL. JONATHAN:

01:13:24 WHEN YOU HAD TO EUROPE THIS SUMMER AND YOU -- I OFFER YOU

01:13:28 103, YOU WILL TAKE IT? LISA: NO DOUBT.

01:13:33 THOUGH I WOULD GO SHORT EURO, LONG AIRLINES FLY TO EUROPE.

01:13:36 JONATHAN: TRAITS. YOU ARE SHARING YOUR TRADES?

01:13:38 [LAUGHTER] COMING UP, MODERNITY REPORTING

01:13:44 A NARROWER FIRST QUARTER LOSS THAN ESTIMATED.

01:13:47 THE COMPANY'S NO CATCHES UP WITH US IN JUST A MOMENT.

01:14:03 JONATHAN: STAGFLATION COMES UP IN THE

01:14:07 NEWS CONFERENCE.

01:14:09 I THINK YOU NAILED IT WHEN HE SAID THIS IS WHAT CHAIRMAN

01:14:12 POWELL IS CAN TO DO, LAUGH AND SAY THERE IS NO STAG AND VERY

01:14:16 LITTLE FLATION. DAVID ROSENBERG I ALMOST FELT

01:14:21 LIKE IT WAS VERBATIM WHAT HE WAS SAYING ON THE PROGRAM, IT

01:14:25 WAS LIKE A REPEAT OF THAT IN THE NEWS CONFERENCE. LISA:

01:14:28 JUST PULLED UP THE SHEET. JONATHAN:

01:14:31 NO STAGFLATION OF THE FOMC.

01:14:37 EQUITY FUTURES NOW ON THE S&P 500 POSITIVE BY 0.7%.

01:14:43 NEXT STOP FOR THE NASDAQ IT'S APPLE AFTER THE CLOSE.

01:14:47 THE RUSSELL POSITIVE BY ONE FULL PERCENTAGE POINT.

01:14:53 THE TWO-YEAR BACKING AWAY FROM 5%.

01:14:55 WE ARE DOWN THREE BASIS POINTS ON THE SESSION. LISA:

01:15:01 THIS IS THE PROSPECT OF A HIKE WAS TAKEN OFF THE TABLE.

01:15:05 I'M LOOKING AT FED FUND FUTURES AND YOU CAN SEE ONLY ABOUT ONE

01:15:10 RATE CUT FULLY BEING PRICED INTO THE MARKET FOR THE

01:15:12 REMAINDER OF THE YEAR. TO ME THIS DID NOT REALLY RESET

01:15:17 THE BAR AND TERMS OF HOW MUCH THEY WOULD CUT.

01:15:18 IT TOOK AWAY THE TAIL RISK OF A HIKE.

01:15:24 >> THAT WAS WHAT YESTERDAY WAS ABOUT AND MAYBE THAT'S WHAT THE

01:15:26 PRICE ACTION WAS ABOUT FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES OF THE NEWS

01:15:27 CONFERENCE. WE GOT A BOUNCE THIS MORNING.

01:15:35 DOLLAR-YEN RIGHT NOW WE ARE POSITIVE BY .2%.

01:15:39 WEAKER JAPANESE YEN AGAIN AFTER THE STRONGER JAPANESE YEN LATER

01:15:44 IN THE SESSION. WHAT IS THERE TO SAY OF

01:15:48 STANDARD CHARTER. IS THAT WHAT HE SAID.

01:15:54 >> I DON'T WATCH MOVIE UNLESS THEY'RE ABOVE A 60%.

01:15:56 UNLESS IT'S A CULT CLASSIC.

01:16:00 >> THE WORSE THE RATING THE BETTER THE MOVIE FOR JONATHAN

01:16:02 FERRO.

01:16:07 >> I DON'T GO ON ROTTEN TOMATOES.

01:16:10 >> AND THEN I FILTER IT OUT.

01:16:13 >> I GO TO THE MOVIES AND WATCH IT. SOMETIMES WHAT I ENJOY, YOU

01:16:18 KNOW THE FILM CRITIC WHO'S GOT BIG IDEAS OF WHAT A MOVIE

01:16:20 SHOULD BE. I JUST WANT TO RELAX. WITH THE SAME PLOT AND IT'S

01:16:30 HIGHLY PROTECTABLE AND YOU KNOW WHAT'S CAN HAPPEN.

01:16:32 AT THE END EVERYONE'S HAPPY. ENOUGH SURPRISES ON THE SHOW.

01:16:39 FED CHAIR JAY POWELL DOWNPLAYING THE CHANCE OF RATE

01:16:40 HIKES. TRADERS TURNING THEIR -- AND

01:16:44 THE U.S. PAYROLLS REPORT. CALLING FOR A PRINT OF 240 K.

01:16:52 BEFORE WE GET THERE WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THIS, APPLE

01:16:53 REPORTING AFTER THE CLOSING BELL.

01:16:56 INVESTORS LOOKING FOR DETAILS ON IPHONE SALES WHICH HAVE BEEN

01:17:00 SLOWING PARTICULAR IN CHINA IT WILL ALSO GIVE A FIRST LOOK AT

01:17:05 SALES OF THE VISION PRO WHICH DEBUTED IN FEBRUARY.

01:17:08 THE STOCK IS UP BY 1% ON THE SESSION ON THE YEAR WE ARE DOWN

01:17:09 12%.

01:17:14 >> YOU'VE GOT THE CHINA QUESTION AND HOW MUCH THEY'RE

01:17:18 ABLE TO EXPANDED TO CHINA GIVEN THE COMPETITION FOR DOMESTIC

01:17:21 BRANDS BUT JUST GENERALLY HOW MUCH ARE CONSUMERS PUSHING BACK

01:17:25 AGAINST $1200, $1300 PHONES. IT'S NOT WORTH IT TO PAY THAT

01:17:32 IF THERE ISN'T A MATERIAL HARD WORK -- HARDWARE UPGRADE.

01:17:38 ANNMARIE: QUALCOMM IS SAYING THEY SEE A

01:17:39 ROBUST MARKET IN CHINA.

01:17:45 THE ISSUE IS BRANDS AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN CHINA IS THIS

01:17:48 NATIONALISM PATRIOTISM TOWARDS THEIR HOME OWNED BRANDS.

01:17:52 SO QUALCOMM SAYING THIS WILL SLOWDOWN IN CHINA.

01:17:55 THEN IT GOES TO WHAT WILL YOU DO ABOUT THAT, HOW DO YOU FIGHT

01:17:56 THAT. JONATHAN:

01:18:02 IS IT CONSUMER PREFERENCES JUST THE STRENGTH OF THE CONSUMER.

01:18:07 STARBUCKS SAYING IT WAS THE LATTER AND NOT THE FORMER.

01:18:11 DID APPLE REALLY WANT TO GET ON THE CALL LEADER AND START

01:18:15 TALKING ABOUT THE CHINESE CONSUMER THEY DO NOT LIKE U.S.

01:18:17 BRANDS ANYMORE.

01:18:18 >> TIM COOK IS A MASSIVE AMBASSADOR AND THAT'S WHAT

01:18:21 WE'VE BEEN SAYING. AN AMBASSADOR BETWEEN THE U.S.

01:18:23 AND CHINA. ELON MUSK DITCHED OUT ON A

01:18:29 MEETING IN INDIA TO CATER TO THE CHINESE OFFICIALS.

01:18:33 DO YOU SEE A SIMILAR TONE FROM TIM COOK AT THE TIME TO TRYING

01:18:34 TO EXPAND INTO INDIA.

01:18:36 PEOPLE WILL BE LOOKING AT THIS LIKE A SIMILAR DIPLOMATIC

01:18:43 ADDRESS AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE. >> THAT REPORT COMING LATER BUT

01:18:50 OUT ALREADY AND NARROWER THAN EXPECTED FIRST-QUARTER,

01:18:53 COST-CUTTING OFFSETTING A STEEP DECLINE WHICH THEY WERE

01:18:55 EXPECTING TO RECEIVE. AN RSV VACCINE IN THE COMING

01:18:58 DAYS. WONDERFUL TO CATCH UP WITH YOU.

01:19:04 THE STOCK IS JUST ABOUT POSITIVE IN THE PREMARKET.

01:19:07 YOU TALK ABUT HOW YOUR BALANCING COST CUTS HERE WITH

01:19:10 INVESTING AND INNOVATION GIVEN WHAT'S IN THE PIPELINE.

01:19:13 >> GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.

01:19:19 VERY PLEASED TO REPORT WE TRIED TO FOCUS ON HOW DO WE DRIVE

01:19:25 SALES, HOW DO WE PRIORITIZE OPPORTUNITIES WE ANNOUNCE WE

01:19:29 ARE STOPPING AND SEARCH IN THE TEAM.

01:19:33 IF YOU LOOK AT THE PORTFOLIO WE ARE LOOKING AT ALL INVESTMENTS

01:19:37 AND A THING ABOUT THOSE

01:19:43 VACCINES IS IF YOU THINK ABOUT COVID WE SEE THAT SUCCESS FROM

01:19:47 COVID BUT THE INVESTMENT HAS GONE DOWN A LOT.

01:19:50 RSV WE ARE ANTICIPATING A LAUNCH THIS SPRING.

01:19:57 WE CAN STILL HAVE A LOT OF NEW STUDIES GOING ON, REUSING THE

01:20:02 CAPITAL USED IN THE OTHER PRODUCTS BEFORE.

01:20:07 WE ARE IN A 50-50 PROFIT SHARE WITH MARK SO THEY ARE -- WE ARE

01:20:13 INVESTING A LOT YOU MIGHT'VE SEEN LAST WEEK WITH OPENAI WE

01:20:21 HAVE MORE THAN 700 GPT'S GROWING ACROSS NOT ONLY SCIENCE

01:20:26 BUT PRODUCTIVITY IN MANUFACTURING, SO THAT'S HOW WE

01:20:30 ARE DOING THIS.

01:20:32 >> LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING OUR COLLEAGUES ARE FOCUSED ON

01:20:35 AND THAT'S YOUR RSV SHOT. SOME DATA IS SHOWING MAYBE IT

01:20:39 DOESN'T LAST AS LONG AS OTHERS IN THE MARKET.

01:20:43 WHAT WERE HOPING TO KNOW IS WHETHER THAT'S QUESTIONED BY

01:20:47 THE PROMISE OF YOUR NET -- TECHNOLOGY.

01:20:52 >> IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA THEY ARE VERY SIMILAR SO I DON'T

01:20:56 THINK IT'S CORRECT TO SAY ONE OF THE VACCINES DOESN'T LAST AS

01:21:00 LONG AS THE OTHER ONES. YOU LOOK AT THE DATA.

01:21:09 THIS WILL BE DEBATED AT THE CDC MEETING. THIS DOESN'T WORRY ME.

01:21:16 IF YOU LOOK AT DURATION THE DURATION OF VACCINATION IS

01:21:21 INDUCED AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE CANCER PRODUCT THE ONLY REASON

01:21:24 IT WORKS IS T CELLS, NOT ANTIBODIES.

01:21:27 THEY ARE GOING AND ATTACKING THE CANCER.

01:21:34 IF VACCINES HAVE A GOOD T CELL RESPONSE I'M NOT WORRIED THAT

01:21:36 ALL ABOUT DURATION.

01:21:39 >> PRETTY MUCH EVERY TIME WE SPEAK I ASK YOU HAVE WEAKER

01:21:40 CURED CANCER YET. IT'S BEEN ONE OF THE BIG

01:21:47 QUESTIONS, THE HOPE FOR THE MRNA VACCINES.

01:21:51 YOU HAVE THIS MELANOMA VACCINE IN THE WORKS, WHAT MORE DO YOU

01:21:54 HAVE TO DO TO GET IT SET UP FOR THE APPROVAL PROCESS TO APPLY,

01:21:58 ARE YOU USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO EXPEDITE THAT?

01:22:02 STEPHANE: IF YOU LOOK AT CANCER TREATMENTS IN MELANOMA WE HAVE

01:22:08 SAID WE NEED TO LOOK AT THREE THINGS ABOUT AN ACCELERATED

01:22:14 APPROVAL. SO THE DATA WE SHARED ON THE

01:22:19 SHOW SEVERAL TIMES WE'VE SEEN DURATION IF YOU REMEMBER IN

01:22:24 DECEMBER IT WAS BETTER THAN THE TWO-YEAR SURVIVAL SO THE

01:22:27 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PEOPLE THAT ARE JUST GETTING AROUND IS

01:22:30 GETTING WIDER. THIS VERY STRONG EVIDENCE THE

01:22:35 DRUG IS WORKING SO THAT'S NUMBER ONE.

01:22:39 WE NEED TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY ENROLLED.

01:22:45 SO WE ARE WORKING VERY ACTIVELY TWO MONTHS EARLIER THAN PLANNED.

01:22:52 SO WHEN WE ARE SUBSTANTIALLY ENROLLED IT COULD BE LATER THIS

01:22:59 YEAR AND WE NEED TO FILE IN THE RESTRICTION DOSSIER MORE

01:23:01 INFORMATION ABOUT THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS.

01:23:03 IT IS ALLOWED TO GO, THAT HAS BEEN BEAT BUT IT IS WORKING

01:23:10 NONSTOP. A BIT LIKE DURING COVID IN THE

01:23:14 PANDEMIC. SO ANTICIPATE POTENTIALLY

01:23:22 SOMETIME NEXT YEAR IF A REGULATOR WAS WILLING TO LOOK

01:23:26 AT THE ACCELERATED APPROVAL IT WOULD BE AVAILABLE BECAUSE ONE

01:23:31 INTO PEOPLE BENEFIT WOULD KNOW THIS IS COMING BACK COMPARED TO

01:23:35 THE BEST DRUG AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET.

01:23:36 >> CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE YOU TALKED ABOUT ARTIFICIAL

01:23:39 INTELLIGENCE. EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT

01:23:41 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. COULD YOU TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH

01:23:46 THAT COULD EXPEDITE SOME OF THE DRUG PRODUCTION WE ARE SEEING

01:23:50 AND HOW MUCH THAT COULD GET US TO ACHIEVE THAT CURE FOR

01:23:57 CANCER, THAT CURE FOR ALS, I SIT AROUND AND WORRY, I'M JUST

01:24:02 WONDERING IS THIS GOING TO BE IN OUR LIFETIME AND THE NEXT

01:24:05 COUPLE OF YEARS BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE MACHINE LEARNING.

01:24:16 >> FIRST IS I THINK MACHINE LEARNING WITH SOCIAL APPS IN

01:24:22 INDUSTRY WILL ACCELERATE THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE HUMAN BODY.

01:24:25 IF YOU THINK ABOUT ALZHEIMER'S AND OTHER COMPLICATED DISEASES

01:24:28 WE DO NOT HAVE SOLUTIONS FOR YET AS SOCIETY IT'S BECAUSE WE

01:24:31 DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE BIOLOGY.

01:24:37 WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THE DISEASE EVOLVES SO WE ARE

01:24:41 TRYING THINGS AND SOME WORK BUT VERY FEW WORK.

01:24:44 MOST OF THEM DON'T WORK BECAUSE WE ARE TRYING AND GUESSING.

01:24:52 THEN THE INDUSTRY HAS ACTIONS TO DEAL WITH THIS.

01:24:56 AI WILL ACCELERATE AND BE FUNDAMENTAL.

01:24:59 AI IS ALREADY USED TO ACCELERATE DISCOVERY ONCE YOU

01:25:03 UNDERSTAND IT. WE HAVE DIFFERENT CHEMICAL

01:25:09 MATTERS GENERATED BY OUR AI SYSTEM.

01:25:13 TO ACCELERATE THE WORK HUMANS ARE DOING.

01:25:17 AND THEN THERE'S A HUGE CHAPTER ON PRODUCTIVITY.

01:25:23 IF YOU THINK ABOUT -- IT'S BASICALLY DOING EXPERIMENTS

01:25:30 GETTING THE DATA, DOING MORE EXPERIMENTS AND WHEN YOU HAVE

01:25:34 STUDIED ON, MY POINT IS IT'S ALL ABOUT DATA.

01:25:39 HUNDREDS OF BUSINESS PROCESSES AND I THINK MANY OF THOSE IF

01:25:43 NOT MOST OF THOSE WOULD BE ABLE TO APPLY AI TO GO FASTER.

01:25:52 THE EXAMPLE WE SHARED, THE TEAM WANTED GPT TO HELP US DO THE

01:25:53 SELECTION.

01:25:59 PHASE ONE YOU TRY SEVERAL DOSES AND THEN BASED ON THE DATA YOU

01:26:01 GET IN THE CLINIC AND DECIDE WHICH ONES GO INTO YOUR FACE.

01:26:07 BY PEOPLE IN MEETING EXPERTS WITH THE DATA.

01:26:11 WITH CHEAT -- GPT THEY BASICALLY GET ALL THE DATA IN

01:26:17 THE CLINICAL STUDY AND SUGGEST -- THAT'S ALREADY BLOCKED OR

01:26:23 USED OF THE COMPANY. THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE.

01:26:28 IF YOU PUT THAT ON THE HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT PROCESSES FOR THE

01:26:34 CLINIC, THE ANALYZING OF THE DATA.

01:26:36 I THINK YOU CAN SAVE A LOT OF TIME.

01:26:40 ONLY HISTORY WILL SHOW US IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS CAN YOU

01:26:47 SHAVE 40%, 50% I THINK IT'S GOOD TO BE VERY SIGNIFICANT.

01:26:49 >> WE'VE GOT TO LEAVE IT THERE. AMAZING TO LISTEN TO YOU TALK

01:26:54 ABOUT THE EFFORTS TAKING PLACE AT MODERNA.

01:27:00 TRYING TO BRING UP SEX AND THE CITY WITH THE MODERNITY CEO.

01:27:03 YOU WANT TO SPRING CARRIE BRADSHAW INTO THE CONVERSATION.

01:27:06 >> WHEN I WAS A KID I DIDN'T HAVE THE TV.

01:27:09 THIS EXPLAINS A LOT. LET'S GET YOU AN UPDATE ON

01:27:14 STORIES ELSEWHERE. HERE'S YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF.

01:27:22 >> THE ARIZONA SENATE VOTED 16-14 TO REPEAL AN 1864 LAW

01:27:27 THAT WOULD MAKE NEARLY ALL ABORTIONS A CRIME.

01:27:28 THE STATEHOUSE HAS ALREADY APPROVED A REPEAL BILL AND THE

01:27:33 DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR PLEDGED TO SIGN IT INTO LAW.

01:27:36 ONCE IT IS OFFICIALLY REPEALED WOMEN IN ARIZONA WILL BE ABLE

01:27:39 TO HAVE ABORTIONS UNTIL 15 WEEKS OF PREGNANCY.

01:27:45 SHARES OF SHELL ARE HIGHER, THE ENERGY PRODUCER SAW THE PROFIT,

01:27:46 AND ABOVE F'S -- ESTIMATES. THE COMPANY SAID IT WOULD

01:27:51 REPURCHASE $3.5 MILLION OF SHARES IN THE SECOND QUARTER

01:27:55 BREAK AND AMOUNTS IN THE TWO PREVIOUS REPORTING PERIOD.

01:28:00 THEY BELIEVE THE SHARE PRICE IS NOT CURRENTLY REFLECT THE FULL

01:28:03 VALUE OF THE COMPANY AND BUYBACKS WILL CONTINUE UNTIL

01:28:05 THEY FEEL IT DOES. SHARES OF PALATINE GAINING IN

01:28:08 PREMARKET TRADING. BARRY MCCARTHY IS STEPPING DOWN.

01:28:16 PLUS HEADCOUNTS WILL BE CUT AT 15% OR ABOUT 400 WORKERS.

01:28:20 PELOTON MISSED ON REVENUE AND DIGITAL SUBSCRIBERS IN THE

01:28:22 THIRD QUARTER AND GUIDANCE FOR THE FULL YEAR WAS ALSO NARROWED

01:28:27 BELOW THE AVERAGE ANALYST ESTIMATE.

01:28:29 THAT'S YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF. JONATHAN:

01:28:32 UP NEXT ON THE PROGRAM CHAIR POWELL STAYED TRUE TO FORM.

01:28:37 >> THIS A LOT OF RELIEF HERE -- BELIEF YEAR THE CHAIRMAN STAYED

01:28:44 TRUE.

01:28:45 REITERATING THE KEY POINTS AROUND AN ASYMMETRIC RESPONSE

01:28:47 FUNCTION. JONATHAN: JEFF ROSENBERG PRETENDING HE

01:28:49 DID NOT KNOW. LISA: YOU THINK THAT WAS JUST A DAY?

01:28:53 JONATHAN: ABSOLUTELY.

01:29:01 YOU CAN WRITE TO BOB AND TELL HOW TO PRONOUNCE HIS NAME.

01:29:04 IT'S NEXT ON THE PROGRAM. FROM NEW YORK, THIS IS

01:29:05 BLOOMBERG.

01:29:19 JONATHAN: EQUITIES RIGHT NOW ON THE S&P

01:29:24 POSITIVE BY 0.6% WE ARE UP. BOUNCING BACK FROM THE LOSSES

01:29:25 YESTERDAY. 45990 SIX.

01:29:31 SO TRY TO WORK OUT WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE.

01:29:34 IN THE FX MARKET. SO DARK.

01:29:43 THINKING ABOUT THE PANDEMICS, -- >> WE WERE TALKING WITH THE

01:29:46 CEO OF MODERNA. IT WORKED.

01:29:49 UNDER SURVEILLANCE THIS MORNING CHAIR POWELL STAYING TRUE TO

01:29:54 FORM.

01:29:55 >> I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF RELIEF HERE THAT THE CHAIRMAN

01:29:58 STAYED TRUE TO WHAT WAS IN FROM THIS CHAIRMAN.

01:30:04 HAS BEEN ONE SIDED LOOKING AT THE GLASS HALF FULL AND

01:30:09 REITERATING THE KIND OF KEY POINT AROUND AN ASYMMETRIC

01:30:13 RESPONSE FUNCTION.

01:30:14 >> TREASURIES CLIMBING. THE TWO YIELDS DROPPING FOR THE

01:30:19 FIFTH STRAIGHT TERM AFTER A FED DECISION.

01:30:20 FED CHAIR JAY POWELL KEEPING HOPE ALIVE FOR RATE CUT AND

01:30:22 LEAVING THE TIMING ON CERTAIN.

01:30:30 WITH THE FED SQUEEZE, THE BAR REMAINS HIGH FOR THE TREASURY

01:30:31 YIELD. IN A SCENARIO WHERE INFLATION

01:30:34 IS STICKY BUT IS NOT MEANINGFULLY ACCELERATE FROM

01:30:38 HERE. SO PATRICK GOOD MORNING TO YOU.

01:30:41 TO CHAIRMAN POWELL JUST PUT A CEILING ON YIELDS HERE.

01:30:47 >> THAT'S BEEN OUR VIEW THROUGH THE YEARS THAT THE FRONT-END

01:30:50 WILL STRUGGLE TO GET ABOUT 5% BECAUSE THE MARKET IS PEGGED TO

01:30:52 FET EXPECTATIONS. AND THE LONG END AS WELL

01:30:57 BECAUSE OF THE FACT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY CLEAR CATALYST FOR

01:31:03 SELLOFF OR PUSHBACK IN THE MARKETS AND IN AN ENVIRONMENT

01:31:08 WHERE THE EXPECTATION IS THE FED WILL KEEP POLICY HIGHER FOR

01:31:11 LONGER YOU SHOULD START TO SEE THAT GROWTH AND INFLATION THAT

01:31:13 WOULD MEAN YOU ARE LONGER YIELDS.

01:31:19 >> FORGIVE ME FOR HAVING SUCH A SHORT TIME HORIZON.

01:31:21 IF WE GET AN UPSIDE SURPRISE ON PAYROLLS HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND

01:31:23 TO THAT ACROSS THE CURVE?

01:31:26 >> I THINK YOU SEE A BIT OF A SELLOFF.

01:31:33 THE MARKET IS NOT GOING TO LEAN TOWARDS HIKES, BUT THE AMOUNT

01:31:35 OF SELLOFF YOU SEE ON THE STRONG FRONT IS GOING TO BE A

01:31:40 LOT LESS THEN THE RALLY YOU ARE GOING TO SEE EVEN A SLIGHTLY

01:31:45 BELOW CONSENSUS WEAKER PRINT. THE BIAS AT LEAST IN THIS

01:31:49 MARKET IS ASYMMETRICALLY SKEWED TOWARDS THE DOWNSIDE. LISA:

01:31:55 TO FOLLOW ON WHAT JOHN IS SAYING MAYBE THAT'S THE CASE IN

01:31:57 THE FRONT-END. WHAT ABOUT THE LONG END.

01:32:02 DO YOU SEE THAT BEING MORE SIGNIFICANT IF THERE'S MORE

01:32:05 THAN THE ECONOMY -- THE MARY ADMITTING.

01:32:12 >> ONE QUESTION THAT I'VE BEEN ASKED AT LEAST IN THE LAST

01:32:15 COUPLE OF WEEKS HEADING INTO THE FOMC MEETING IS WHAT WOULD

01:32:20 CAUSE THE FED TO HIKE AND TO ME ONE OF THE THINGS I WOULD BE

01:32:23 WATCHING IS THE RISE IN INFLATION EXPECTATIONS.

01:32:27 IF THE MARKET PUSHES BACK ON THE FED NARROWLY BECAUSE IT IS

01:32:35 STICKY OR TRYING TO ACCELERATE YOU WILL SEE THAT WITH HIGHER

01:32:38 INFLATION EXPECTATIONS MEANS HIGHER LONG END YIELDS WITH THE

01:32:40 FRONT-END. THAT'S SOMETHING I'M WATCHING

01:32:48 AGAIN THAT POWELL DISMISSED ANY NOTION THEY WOULD HIKE SO THE

01:32:51 FOCUS IS VERY MUCH ON WHEN THEY WILL CUT NOT IF THEY WILL HIKE.

01:32:54 LISA: IS THIS CONVERSATION FRAMED

01:32:56 WRONG? THIS IS SOMETHING WHERE THEY

01:32:59 SAID THIS IS A FED THAT IS STILL PRETTY HAWKISH.

01:33:03 THEY WILL ONLY CUT ONCE, THAT'S WHAT'S BASED -- BAKED IN.

01:33:07 AND THEY CAN REALLY GET AHEAD OF A SLOWDOWN THAT'S ALREADY IN

01:33:11 PLACE THAT COULD LEAD TO A HIGH INCREASE IN UNEMPLOYMENT.

01:33:15 IS THIS MARKET UNDERPRICED FOR A HARD LANDING AT A POINT WHERE

01:33:17 EVERYONE IS COALESCING AROUND GOLDILOCKS.

01:33:23 >> IF THEY DO HAVE MEANINGFUL SLOWDOWN IN GROWTH'S THE FED IS

01:33:25 LOCKED AND LOADED. I DO NOT SEE THEM BEING

01:33:29 CONCERNED ABOUT CUTTING RATES ACROSS THE BOARD IF THEY NEED

01:33:32 TO. I THINK THAT'S A GOOD PROBLEM.

01:33:40 THE CONCERN IS IF YOU SEE A 70 STYLE ISSUE WHERE INFLATION

01:33:44 STARTS TO RISE BECAUSE THE FED HAS KEPT POLICY EASIER IF THEY

01:33:48 EASED TOO SOON THAT I THINK IS THE BIGGEST. COMING INTO THIS

01:33:53 YEAR THE END OF LAST YEAR POWELL PIVOTED FROM A

01:33:55 PERSISTENT FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AT THE NOVEMBER MEETING TO AN

01:33:57 EASING BIAS. THAT ADDED TO A SIGNIFICANT

01:34:04 EASING OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND THAT IN MY VIEW LEAD TO

01:34:08 SOME OF THE SERVICES SIDE INFLATION WE ARE SEEING.

01:34:14 SO I THINK A PREMATURE PIVOT OR PREMATURE CUT ADDS A BIGGER

01:34:16 RISK FOR THE FED THEN IF THEY KEPT POLICY TIGHT AND THEN CUT

01:34:21 AGGRESSIVELY BECAUSE IT THEY WANT THEM TO CUT.

01:34:24 >> THE EASING OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS CONTRIBUTING TO THE

01:34:27 UPSIDE SURPRISES WE'VE HAD SO FAR.

01:34:30 CHAIRMAN POWELL DID NOT APPEAR TO IN THE NEWS CONFERENCE.

01:34:34 HOW DO YOU GAUGE HIS VIEW AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WHAT'S

01:34:37 HAPPENING.

01:34:44 >> POWELL FOR SOME REASON SEEMS TO BE CONCERNED FINANCIAL

01:34:47 CONDITIONS ARE TIGHT, HE IS JUST COMPLETELY DROPPED THE

01:34:51 DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND EVERYONE ELSE

01:34:54 HAS BEEN ASKING FOR. THEY ONLY SEEM TO BE CONCERNED

01:34:58 WITH FINANCIAL CONDITIONS ARE TIGHT AND IT'S EASY THEY

01:35:03 BASICALLY IGNORE THE NARRATIVE ON INFLATION CONDITIONS.

01:35:08 MY VIEW IS RATES WHERE THEY ARE, OF THE TWO-YEAR AROUND 5%,

01:35:12 THE 10 YEAR 5% WILL EVENTUALLY FEEDTHROUGH.

01:35:14 THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO SEE HAPPENING.

01:35:19 HIGHER YIELDS WILL IMPACT EQUITIES AND OTHER RISKY ASSETS.

01:35:23 JONATHAN: WHERE I'M CONFUSED IS THAT'S --

01:35:25 THEY THINK WHERE IT ALREADY IS. LAST YEAR IT'S BEEN A

01:35:31 SUPPLY-SIDE REBALANCING BUT YET THEY KEEP POINTING TO THE LABOR

01:35:35 MARKET AS EVIDENCE THEY ARE SUFFICIENTLY RESTRICTIVE.

01:35:38 WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT.

01:35:40 >> I FIND IT SOMEWHAT INTERESTING BECAUSE THERE IS AN

01:35:44 INFLUX OF PARTICIPANTS COMING INTO THE WORKFORCE WHETHER IT

01:35:50 BE PEOPLE FROM THE SIDELINES INTO THE WORKFORCE OR

01:35:54 IMMIGRATION SO THERE ARE SOME POSITIVE MOMENTUM IN THE

01:35:55 ECONOMY IN THE WORKFORCE. ALSO LOOKING AT AN ENVIRONMENT

01:36:02 WHERE THERE'S A DECENT AMOUNT OF FISCAL STIMULUS IN THE

01:36:04 BACKGROUND THAT STILL HELPING THE ECONOMY.

01:36:07 CONSUMERS ARE EXTRAORDINARILY RESILIENT.

01:36:12 SO YOU KNOW THEY NEED TO SEE A MEANINGFUL CHANGE IN THE JOB

01:36:15 MARKET OR SLOWDOWN IN THE JOB MARKET FOR A SLOWDOWN IN THE

01:36:17 ECONOMY. YOU ARE JUST NOT SEEING THAT AS

01:36:19 IT STANDS.

01:36:29 >> HOW DOES THAT PUSH AGAINST THE REST OF THE YEAR IN TERMS

01:36:30 OF AN INVESTMENT THESIS.

01:36:35 >> I THINK UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE BOND MARKET IT WILL BE A

01:36:38 SIDEWAYS TRADE TO WE HAVE SOME SORT OF CLEAR INDICATION THAT

01:36:42 THERE'S A SLOWDOWN IN THE ECONOMY SO MY BIAS IS STILL

01:36:43 TOWARDS NO YIELDS.

01:36:50 I THINK THE DATA IS GOING TO BE SOMEWHAT SIDEWAYS AND IT'S

01:36:51 GOING TO BE A BUMPY ROAD FOR THE RATES MARKET NOT JUST FOR

01:36:55 FED POLICY AND INFLATION BUT ALSO WHEN WE SEE A LOT OF THIS

01:37:01 BACK-AND-FORTH WITH THE DATA BUT REALLY THE TRAJECTORY

01:37:04 TOWARDS LOWER YIELDS ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT THERE IS AN

01:37:07 ELECTION WE WILL SEE A LITTLE BIT OF A BID TO QUALITY.

01:37:12 >> I DON'T WANT TO BE TOO CRITICAL OF CHAIRMAN POWELL BUT

01:37:16 WE KNOW THAT'S A BIG TRADITION ON WALL STREET.

01:37:22 WHAT WAS INTERESTING YESTERDAY WAS WHETHER THE DISINFLATIONARY

01:37:25 PROCESS THE CHAIRMAN HAD BELIEVED TO HAVE STARTED

01:37:28 WHETHER IT STOPPED, HOW DISRUPTED IT IS.

01:37:31 THEY DIDN'T REALLY ADDRESS THAT IN A MATERIAL WAY.

01:37:35 >> HE SEEMED TO BE SAYING WE ARE ON TRACK AND DOING JUST

01:37:36 GREAT. IT'S JUST WORKING A LITTLE MORE

01:37:38 SLOWLY. IT DIDN'T SEEM TO MAKE THEM

01:37:43 QUESTION ANY OF THE BROADER PARADIGMS IN TERMS OF

01:37:45 INFLATION, IN TERMS OF WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE LABOR MARKET

01:37:51 EVEN WHEN HE WAS ASKED TO ENTERTAIN OR NOT TALKING OR THE

01:37:52 TERMINAL RATE. BASICALLY THAT WAS THE

01:37:56 PRESUMPTION. DOES HE NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT

01:38:01 IT OR IS HE SO CONVICTED HE HAS THE ABSOLUTE RIGHT APPROACH.

01:38:02 AND IT WILL TAKE MORE TIME.

01:38:05 >> HE HAD TO COME OUT AND ANSWER WHY HAS IT ONLY BEEN

01:38:08 BUMPS. WHY IS THIS TURNING INTO A

01:38:10 TREND. WHY ARE YOU NOT SEEING THIS

01:38:13 DISINFLATION.

01:38:17 >> I KNOW EVERY SINGLE WORD IS SO CLOSELY SCRUTINIZED BY

01:38:19 PEOPLE LIKE US AND THAT WAS A CHALLENGE FOR THE CHAIRMAN

01:38:22 MAYBE IT'S NOT THE APPROPRIATE FORM TO DO IT IN.

01:38:25 >> I JUST KEEP WONDERING WHETHER HE HAS ANY HAWKISH

01:38:28 BONES IN HIM. I FEEL LIKE HE MIGHT BE ONE OF

01:38:39 THE MORE DEAF -- JONATHAN: THIS WAS GREAT, GOOD TO SEE YOU.

01:38:42 THIRD HOUR OF BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE UP NEXT.

01:38:58 >> I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF RELIEF HERE THAT THE CHAIRMAN

01:39:00 STAYED TRUE TO WHAT WEâ€™'VE SEEN. >> THE FED AT LEAST IN THE

01:39:03 PRESENT MANNER SAID LET'S BE CAUTIOUS HERE.

01:39:06 THAT WAS GOOD TO HOLD BACK.

01:39:09 >> PRETTY APPROPRIATE GIVEN WHAT HE SAID.

01:39:12 >> THIS IS REALLY GOOD FOR THE MARKET. I THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT

01:39:17 MESSAGE.

01:39:18 >> THIS PARTICULAR STATEMENT TO SOMETHING THE MARKETS WILL LIKE.

01:39:21 IT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE MARKET WANTS.

01:39:24 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE WITH JONATHAN

01:39:27 FERRO, LISA ABRAMOWICZ AND ANNMARIE HORDERN.

01:39:30 >> 30 MINUTES AWAY FROM JOBLESS CLAIMS IN AMERICA.

01:39:32 JUST A FLAVOR THE ESTIMATES FOR YOU.

01:39:37 WE WILL HAVE A REPORT FOR YOU. THE ESTIMATE IN OUR SURVEY

01:39:41 241,000 ACROSS THE STREET A PRETTY BIG NUMBER. JEFFRIES 280.

01:39:47 GOLDMAN SACHS 275. THE LIKES OF STANDARD CHARTERED

01:39:49 270. BIG NUMBERS IN THE MIX GOING

01:39:51 INTO TOMORROW.

01:39:55 >> NOT TO BE TOO THEORETICAL BUT DOES IT MATTER HOW BIG THE

01:39:58 NUMBER IS AND THIS IS WHAT ANDREW WAS TALKING ABOUT.

01:40:03 IS THIS SORT OF DISTORTED BY OTHER TRENDS NOTABLY

01:40:05 IMMIGRATION IN A WAY THAT MAKES THIS HEADLINE NUMBER MASKING

01:40:06 SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENING ELSEWHERE.

01:40:13 >> JUST HAD A WONDERFUL CONVERSATION FROM SOCGEN. RISK

01:40:17 ASYMMETRICALLY TOWARDS A LOWER YIELD.

01:40:20 THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS MORE LIKELY TO RESPOND TO WEAKER

01:40:23 DATA THAN STRONGER DATA. BASED ON WHAT THEY SAID WHICH

01:40:27 WAS IF WE GET AN UPSIDE SURPRISE THE MOVE HIGHER WILL

01:40:31 BE MUCH LESS THAN THE MOVE LOWER GETTING A DOWNSIDE

01:40:35 SURPRISE.

01:40:36 >> THIS IS A FED THAT WANTS TO CUT RATES AND IS NOT CONCERNED

01:40:37 THAT THE POLICY IS UNDULY EASY. THIS RAISES THE QUESTION AT ONE

01:40:43 POINT IS THE RISK ON THE OTHERS THAT INFLATION CONCERNS PICK UP.

01:40:48 IS THERE A FEAR ESPECIALLY IF YOU GET EASING FINANCIAL

01:40:50 CONDITIONS WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GET THOSE

01:40:52 BONDS AND STOCKS HOW MUCH DO YOU END UP SORT OF FOSTERING

01:40:54 THIS INFLATIONARY CYCLE. ANNMARIE:

01:40:59 JOHN AUTHERS TALKS ABOUT THIS IN HIS COLUMN.

01:41:02 THE FACT THAT IN HINDSIGHT IT WAS PRICES PAID THAT WAS A

01:41:05 WINDOW TO THAT INFLATIONARY SCENARIO WE SAW IN 2020 AND

01:41:10 2021.

01:41:17 POWELL DID NOT SEEM TO EVEN ENTERTAIN THE IDEA THERE COULD

01:41:20 BE A SCENARIO IN THE FUTURE FOR A HIKE.

01:41:21 HE SAID THERE IS A PATH TO CUTTING AND HOLDING.

01:41:23 WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE DATA.

01:41:26 THERE'S NO PATH AT THE MOMENT TO HIKING.

01:41:31 >> APPARENTLY BRING UP STAGFLATION IN THE NEWS

01:41:32 CONFERENCE THEY ARE LAUGHING AROUND THE ROOM.

01:41:36 >> I WAS ALIVE IN THE 1970'S. THIS, NO STAG, NO FLATION.

01:41:41 JONATHAN: JUST A WHISPER LAST WEEK.

01:41:47 ANNMARIE: I DID NOT CALL IT THAT.

01:41:49 OTHER PEOPLE ARE SAYING THE SAME THING.

01:41:53 WE'VE GOT SLOWING GROWTH AND INFLATION THAT STILL IS STICKY

01:41:55 AND COMING IN FASTER THAN EXPECTED.

01:41:58 BUT IT'S NOT A GREAT RECIPE. THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE GETTING

01:42:00 OUT.

01:42:04 >> STABILIZING AROUND THREE VERSUS STABILIZING BY TWO.

01:42:10 THE ESTIMATE, THE PREVIOUS NUMBER TWO OF SEVEN.

01:42:14 GETTING TO ALL OF THAT. EQUITY FUTURES ON THE S&P 500

01:42:19 LOOKING LIKE THIS POSITIVE BY 0.6 PERCENT.

01:42:21 YIELDS ARE LOWER BY A BASIS POINT OR TWO.

01:42:23 BREAKING THAT LEVEL EARLIER. COMING UP THIS HOUR WE WILL

01:42:29 CATCH UP LOOKING AHEAD TO PAYROLLS, FRONTIER AIRLINE CEO

01:42:34 AS THE LOW COST CARRIER REPORTS EARNINGS AND LOWER RATE OF FS

01:42:37 INVESTMENTS HAVE CONTINUED CALLS FOR SURGICAL RATE CUTS.

01:42:40 CHAIR POWELL DOWNPLAYING POSSIBLE RATE HIKES WOULD THE

01:42:44 VIEW RATES WILL NOT BE HIGH FOR LONGER.

01:42:50 CHAIR POWELL STRUCK A DOVISH TONE IN HIS PRESS CONFERENCE AT

01:42:53 LEAST RELATIVE TO MARKET EXPECTATIONS BUT WILL NEED TO

01:42:55 GAIN GREATER CONFIDENCE ON THE PATH TO 2%.

01:42:58 THEY EXPECT IT WILL TAKE LONGER THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED THEN

01:43:01 BY TAKING OUT OTHER POSSIBILITIES OF AN EARLY RATE

01:43:04 CUT. DO WE NEED THAT RATE CUT THIS

01:43:07 SUMMER TO BE CONSTRUCTIVE ON EQUITIES?

01:43:09 >> I DON'T THINK SO.

01:43:13 >> I THINK THERE'S ENOUGH IN EARNINGS GROWTH AND WE HAD

01:43:19 ENOUGH EVIDENCE FROM THE FED THAT THERE ISN'T COULD BE A

01:43:22 HIKE THIS YEAR BARRING SOMETHING ATROCIOUS ON THE

01:43:25 INFLATION FRONT. I THINK EQUITIES ARE IN A

01:43:28 REALLY GOOD PLACE FUNDAMENTALLY WE HAVE A STRONG ECONOMY,

01:43:33 FUNDAMENTALLY A STRONG CONSUMER SO FAR SLOWING BUT STILL IN A

01:43:35 GOOD PLACE. EARNINGS SO FAR AS WE HAVE SEEN

01:43:39 ESPECIALLY IN THE LARGE-CAP AND THE HIGH-QUALITY PARTS OF THE

01:43:40 EQUITY MARKET ARE DOING WELL. SO WE DON'T NECESSARILY NEED TO

01:43:46 SEE MANY RATE CUTS I THINK IF WE GET ONE OR TWO THAT WILL BE

01:43:48 FINE FOR THE EQUITY MARKETS. IT DOES NOT MEAN EVERY SINGLE

01:43:54 DAY WE GET A RALLY BUT OVER THE NEXT SEVEN TO NINE MONTHS.

01:43:58 >> YOU'VE BEEN CONSTRUCTIVE FOR A WHILE AND THE GROWTH POLICY

01:44:01 MIX. I WANT TO UNDERSTAND MORE THE

01:44:03 GROWTH PART OF THE EQUATION. YOU THE FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIR

01:44:09 LAUGH AT THE POSSIBILITY OF STAG AND THE AMOUNT OF FLATION

01:44:13 WE'VE GOT GREAT ARE YOU STARTING TO SEE GROWTH

01:44:19 DETERIORATE.

01:44:20 WHEN YOU LOOK ACROSS COMPANIES, ARE THERE SIGNS GROWTH IS

01:44:22 DETERIORATING?

01:44:23 >> CHAIR POWELL DID LAUGH AT THE WORD AND I THINK IT WAS A

01:44:26 BIT BOLD TO LAUGH FOR SURE. BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT THE STAG

01:44:30 PIECE. IF THAT MEANS GROWTH BELOW

01:44:36 POTENTIAL WE SAW THAT IN Q1 ALREADY.

01:44:41 FOR YOU IF THAT MEANS GROWTH AT ZERO THEY KNOW THAT.

01:44:44 SO I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU DETERMINE STAG TO BE.

01:44:47 ARE WE NEAR RECESSIONARY LEVELS ABSOLUTELY NOT.

01:44:51 ARE WE SEEING A BIT OF A SLOWDOWN FROM WHAT WAS A VERY

01:44:53 STRONG Q4 YES. I THINK THAT IS TO BE EXPECTED.

01:44:57 WHEN WE MOVE OVER THE COMPANIES AND WHAT WE ARE HEARING FROM

01:45:02 EARNINGS CALLS AND LOOKING IN EARNINGS TRANSCRIPTS I THING

01:45:03 THERE IS A DIVERGENCE WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE SMALLER

01:45:07 MORE DEBT LADEN COMPANIES VERSUS SOME OF THE LARGER

01:45:10 COMPANIES ABLE TO PASS ON PRICING POWER.

01:45:15 YOU ARE SEEING THAT PLAY OUT IN THE MARKETS VERSUS LARGE-CAP.

01:45:20 THERE IS A SLOWDOWN IN CERTAIN POCKETS OF THE EQUITY MARKET.

01:45:23 WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE HIGHER QUALITY PARTS OF THE EQUITY

01:45:27 MARKET I THINK THAT CONTINUES

01:45:29 >> TO DO WELL AS WELL.

01:45:31 >>IT SOUNDS A QUEUE LIKE LARGE-CAP BUT THE BROADENING

01:45:34 OUT TRAY DOESN'T WORK HERE ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE CONCERNED

01:45:36 ABOUT RATES REMAINING HERE AND GROWTH SLOWING ALL.

01:45:42 >> WE WERE RIDING OUR Q2 OUTLOOK THINKING ABOUT WHAT

01:45:47 SHOULD WE NEED TO SEE FOR THE BROADENING TO HAPPEN.

01:45:49 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE THOUGHT ABOUT WAS REALLY THE

01:45:54 FED ACTUALLY SURPRISING WITH MORE RATE CUTS.

01:45:56 SORT OF THE REGIME WE SAW IN OCTOBER NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR

01:45:59 WHEN INFLATION WAS SURPRISING TO THE DOWNSIDE.

01:46:02 GROWTH REMAINS BETTER-THAN-EXPECTED AND

01:46:05 INFLATION COMES IN LOWER THAN EXPECTED.

01:46:08 NOW IT LOOKS LIKE THE PATH IS GETTING EVEN NARROWER.

01:46:12 SO FURTHER BROADENING TO TAKE PLACE IN A MEANINGFUL WAY.

01:46:15 I THINK WE NEED TO SEE INFLATION CONTINUED TO

01:46:18 DECELERATE EVEN MORE SO THAN WITH THE MARKET IS EXPECTING

01:46:22 AND AS OF RIGHT NOW WE HAVEN'T NECESSARILY SEEN THAT.

01:46:26 I THINK INVESTORS ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT'S OUTSIDE OF

01:46:29 THE LARGE-CAP PARTS OF THE MARKET.

01:46:34 AND THE TWO AREAS THAT WE LIKE OUR JAPAN AND INDIA FOR EXACTLY

01:46:36 THAT BROADER ACCESS TO OTHER PARTS OF THE MARKETS.

01:46:38 >> I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT UP JAPAN.

01:46:41 WE ARE LOOKING AT A COUNTRY REALLY STRUGGLING TO GET IT

01:46:42 UNDER CONTROL.

01:46:47 >> THE STORY IS BROADER THAN WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING WITH THE

01:46:48 YEN OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS OR SO.

01:46:54 I THINK THE BIGGER STORY THERE IS MOST U.S.

01:46:55 INVESTORS AND I WOULD SAY MOST INTERNATIONAL INVESTORS HAVE

01:47:00 BEEN VERY UNDER ALLOCATED TO JAPAN FOR THE LAST DECADE.

01:47:04 AND FOR GOOD REASON BECAUSE THERE IS A COUNTRY WHERE YOU

01:47:06 HAVEN'T SEEN INFLATION HAVEN'T SEEN PRICING POWER AND NOW WE

01:47:12 ARE BEGINNING TO SEE INFLATION, BACK AS THE YEN BEGINS TO

01:47:13 WEAKEN WE HAVE INFLATION CONTINUING TO COME BACK AND

01:47:16 RATES BEGIN TO MOVE UP. ALL OF THAT BODES WELL FOR

01:47:19 EQUITIES AGAIN. NOT A SHORT-TERM BUDDY MUCH

01:47:23 MORE STRUCTURAL PLAY AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK INVESTORS, I DO

01:47:29 WANT TO UNDERLINE AN UNDERSCORE THIS IS AROUND INVESTORS NOT AT

01:47:33 ALL BEING ALLOCATED SO IT'S A QUESTION OF BEING UNDERGROUND

01:47:36 VERSUS GETTING BACK TO USUAL. ANNMARIE:

01:47:41 YOU SAY JAPAN AND INDIA ARE DIVERSIFIERS WHEN IT COMES TO

01:47:45 MARKETS ARE THEY AWAY TO FILL THE GAP OF INDIVIDUALS AND

01:47:46 INVESTORS WHO DON'T WANT CHINA ANYMORE. GARGI:

01:47:51 IT CAN BE ONE OF THOSE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT INVESTORS

01:47:53 MOVING TO E.M. IS ANOTHER WAY OF DIVERSIFYING

01:47:57 AWAY FROM LARGE-CAP AND QUALITY WHICH ARE OUR FAVORITE

01:47:58 ALLOCATIONS IN THE U.S. MARKET. I THINK BOTH INDIA AND JAPAN

01:48:03 HAVE STORIES THAT ARE WORKING FOR THEM.

01:48:05 INDIA IT'S AN INFRASTRUCTURE STORY.

01:48:10 IT'S A DEMOGRAPHIC STORY READ FOR JAPAN AS WE TALKED ABOUT IS

01:48:13 VERY MUCH IN INFLATION AND RATE STORY AND I THINK THOSE WILL

01:48:15 PLAY OUT IN YIELDS.

01:48:19 >> EVERYONE'S BEEN ASKING QUESTIONS LIKE WHAT'S FED CHAIR

01:48:22 POWELL GOING TO LOOK AT THAT COMES TOMORROW TO FIGURE OUT

01:48:24 WHETHER THEY ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK OR SHOULD CUT RATES.

01:48:28 I'M MORE CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR REACTION TO ACTUALLY SOME OF

01:48:33 THIS DATA. WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE TO SAY IN

01:48:36 THE JOBS REPORT TO BECOME LESS CONSTRUCTIVE ESPECIALLY

01:48:41 CONSIDERING THE FACT WE HAD ANDREW SAYING A SHARP

01:48:43 DETERIORATION IN THE MARKET.

01:48:47 >> I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO SEE IN THE LABOR MARKET TOMORROW

01:48:53 BUT OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS IS ACTUALLY A STABILIZATION.

01:48:58 WE CAN CONTINUE TO SEE THREE OR 400,000 JOBS WE NEED TO SEE A

01:49:00 STABILIZATION AND MORE THAN THAT I THINK WE NEED TO SEE

01:49:04 WAGES THAT'S THE IMPORTANT PART WE NEED TO SEE WAGES CONTINUE

01:49:09 TO BE ON THE DECELERATING PATH THAT THEY'VE BEEN.

01:49:14 THE RATES MARKET AND THE EQUITY MARKET GETS A LITTLE BIT OF

01:49:16 CONFIDENCE. I ALSO THINK THAT EVEN THOUGH

01:49:22 JACK MA DISMISSED THE ECI. I STILL THINK SOME OF THE OTHER

01:49:28 BROADER MEASURES OF WAGES, I WILL STILL LOOK AND CONTINUE TO

01:49:33 LOOK AT ECI BECAUSE I THINK THOSE ARE VERY GOOD INDICATORS

01:49:36 OF HOW THIS BROAD VAST ECONOMY IS EVOLVING.

01:49:40 FINALLY CPI AND PCE ARE GOING TO BE THE ONLY DETERMINANTS OF

01:49:45 WHAT DRIVES US AT LEAST AS WE THINK ABOUT HER INTEREST RATE

01:49:47 POLICY FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. JONATHAN:

01:49:51 I'M TEMPTED TO ASK A REALLY HORRIBLE QUESTION.

01:49:52 IT'S DIFFICULT TO ANSWER.

01:49:58 HOW BAD WITH THAT NUMBER NEED TO BE TOMORROW FOR US TO BE

01:50:01 TALKING ABOUT CUTS IN JUNE AND JULY.

01:50:04 BASED ON THE CONVERSATION WE'VE HAD WERE NOT COULD BE TALKING

01:50:05 ABOUT HIKE SO HOW BAD DOES THAT NEED TO BE.

01:50:10 >> SOUTH OF 100,000. SOME SORT OF REAL ABERRATION

01:50:15 WITH WAGE DECLINES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

01:50:18 EMPLOYMENT RATE PARTICIPATION RATE COMING DOWN.

01:50:21 YOU HAVE TO SEE THE MARKET IN BROADER GENERATION. GARGI:

01:50:27 FOR JUNE I DON'T THINK IT CHANGES THE PICTURE BECAUSE

01:50:28 THEY'VE INTRODUCED A NEW SENTENCE IN THE FOMC STATEMENT.

01:50:33 FOR THEM TO HAVE TO GO IN THEIR NEXT MEETING SO I THINK JUNE IS

01:50:40 OUT.

01:50:41 I THINK IN COMBINATION OF A WEAKER PAROL SEWED SOMEWHERE

01:50:48 BELOW 125 AND A WEAKER CPI AND PCE I THINK JULY MAY COME BACK

01:50:51 IN THE PICTURE BUT I THINK THERE'S NO WAY IN WHICH JUNE

01:50:56 COMES BACK BECAUSE THEY CUT THAT ONE SENTENCE AROUND

01:50:57 INFLATION AND THAT HAS TO FIRST GET TAKEN OUT OTHERWISE IT

01:51:01 LOOKS TO WAVERING ON THE FENCE.

01:51:03 >> THANKS FOR ENTERTAINING.

01:51:12 LET'S GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON STORIES THIS WEEK.

01:51:16 >> TENSIONS ARE RUNNING HIGH ON THE UCLA CAMPUS.

01:51:20 POLICE ARE CURRENTLY DISMANTLING PRO-PALESTINIAN

01:51:22 PROTESTER ENCAMPMENTS.

01:51:28 JIM AND SIRS ARE ASKING SCHOOLS TO ISRAEL AND PLANNED AMNESTY

01:51:32 TO STUDENTS FOR RULE BREAKING BREAD UCLA ANNOUNCED IN PERSON

01:51:34 CLASSES WILL BE HELD ONLINE TODAY AND TOMORROW.

01:51:39 BLOOMBERG IS REPORTING CHINESE TELECOM GIANT HUAWEI IS EAGERLY

01:51:44 FUNDING CUTTING-EDGE RESEARCH AT AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES

01:51:45 THROUGH AN INDEPENDENT WASHINGTON-BASED FOUNDATION.

01:51:49 DOCUMENTS AND SOURCES SAYING HUAWEI IS THE SOLE FUNDER OF A

01:51:54 RESEARCH COMPETITION THAT IS AWARDED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND

01:51:58 TRACKS HUNDREDS OF PROPOSALS FROM SCIENTISTS INCLUDING THOSE

01:51:59 AT TOP U.S. UNIVERSITIES THAT HAVE BEEN

01:52:05 BANNED THE RESEARCHERS FROM WORKING WITH THE COMPANY.

01:52:08 THEY'RE CURRENTLY BLACKLISTED BY THE U.S. COMMERCE DEPARTMENT.

01:52:10 TESLA IS MAKING MORE COST CUTS. THIS TIME WITH ITS INTERNS.

01:52:17 THE EV MAKER RESCINDING SUMMER INTERNSHIP OFFERS JUST WEEKS

01:52:18 BEFORE STUDENTS WERE SET TO BEGIN.

01:52:23 THIS AS TESLA UNDERGOES MASSIVE JOB CUTS AND SEES A HANDFUL OF

01:52:26 EXECUTIVES LEAVE THE COMPANY REVOKING INTERNSHIP OFFERS IS

01:52:31 UNLIKELY TO SAVE TESLA MUCH MONEY BUT COULD IMPACT ITS

01:52:34 HIRING POINT. BETTER BLOOMBERG BRIEF.

01:52:37 >> N
