Five Americans freed in a prisoner-swap deal with Iran landed safely in Qatar, the latest step in a diplomatic effort Washington hopes will ease tensions in the Middle East and open space for progress on the Islamic Republicâ€™s nuclear program.

The detainees landed just before sunset in heat of 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius) in Doha on Monday afternoon. They were greeted by Qatari and American officials, and one waved to journalists in the tarmac before the group was escorted away.
