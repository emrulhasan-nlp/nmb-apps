Tom Suozzi ’s victory this week in a suburban New York district gives Democrats a blueprint for handling immigration and border security, the thorny issue that is vexing President Joe Biden and his party heading into November’s election.

There are caveats on how much any one special election can reflect or forecast a national political environment. But this race for a Nassau County and Queens district turned on immigration more than anything else — and Suozzi’s deft handling of the issue helped him reclaim the seat he held for three terms, before deciding not to run again in 2022. George Santos flipped the district that year for Republicans.
