00:02 JOINING US NOW IS MARY SIGLER I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO AN

00:03 ABORTION DEBATE, WELCOME BACK. I WONDER HOW YOUR THOUGHTS

00:09 CHANGED VIEW WHEN YOUR AGO THAT AMERICANS HAVE OF THE HIGH

00:10 COURT.

00:13 >> WE'VE SEEN THE COURTS REPUTATION TAKE A HIT.

00:18 THAT'S PARTLY LIKELY BECAUSE THE DOBBS DECISION ITSELF WAS

00:19 UNPOPULAR. WE'D SEEN POLL AFTER POLL THAT

00:25 AMERICANS DIDN'T LIKE THE DOBBS DECISION AND STILL DON'T YOUR

00:26 LEADER. IT'S ALSO BECAUSE I THINK THERE

00:31 WAS A PERCEPTION THAT DOBBS WAS A PARTISAN DECISION.

00:34 THAT THE COURT DIDN'T HAVE TO DECIDE AT THE TIME IT TOOK THE

00:36 CASE. THERE WAS NO CONFLICT ABOUT 15

00:37 WEEK BANDS.

00:43 I THINK IN GENERAL IT MADE MORE AMERICANS THINK OF THE COURT AS

00:47 A POLITICAL BODY RATHER THAN A JURIDICAL ONE. JOE:

00:56 WHEN YOU ADD RECENT REPORTING OF ETHICS CONCERNS WHETHER IT'S

00:59 CLARENCE THOMAS OR JUSTICE ALITO, IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE

01:03 DROPPING THE BALL ON THIS. THERE HAVE BEEN CALLS FOR A

01:07 CODE OF CONDUCT FOR A DIFFERENT SORT OF METHOD OF DECORUM HERE,

01:09 BEHAVIOR AT THIS IN COURT. THAT'S NOT HELPING EITHER IS IT?

01:14 >> IT'S NOT. NOR IS THE COURTS RESPONSE TO

01:17 THESE REPORTS. JUSTICE ALITO IN RESPONSE TO

01:23 THE LATEST RUNS OF REVELATIONS KIND OF COZY RELATIONSHIPS

01:31 BETWEEN M EGA DONORS AND THE COURT WROTE IN A JOURNAL THAT

01:32 IT'S NOT TYPICALLY WHAT YOU THINK OF A JUDGE ABOVE POLITICS

01:34 DOING. THE COURT HAS BEEN PRETTY DEFIANT AND HASN'T BEEN VERY

01:42 APOLOGETIC OR INTERESTED IN THE CREATION OF A CODE OF ETHICS

01:46 AND THAT REINFORCES THE IMPRESSION THAT THE COURT NOT

01:48 ONLY IS PARTISAN BUT IS SORT OF INDIFFERENT TO THE KIND OF

01:50 DAMAGE THAT'S BEING DONE TO THE INSTITUTION. JOE:

01:55 DOES IT CHANGE THE RULES FOR THE COURT?

01:57 THE CHIEF JUSTICE HAS INDICATED THAT THE SUPREME COURT TO

01:59 HANDLE THIS ON ITS OWN. I KNOW THERE'S AN EFFORT IN

02:02 CONGRESS TO DO THIS BUT THE COURT WILL BE LIKELY THE ONE TO

02:04 HAVE TO MOVE.

02:09 >> I THINK, OBVIOUSLY, FROM JUST A POSITION OF PURE

02:13 SELF-INTEREST AND THE STANDPOINT OF THE HEALTH OF THE

02:15 DEMOCRACY IT WOULD BEHOOVE THE COURT TO MOVE.

02:20 BUT WE'VE SEEN A PATTERN OF DEFENSIVENESS FROM THE COURT

02:26 RATHER REAL EVENT ANY INTEREST IN RECKONING WITH BOTH THE

02:28 SUBSTANTIVE PROBLEMS WE ARE SAYING REVEALED BY REPORTING

02:30 LIKE PRO PUBLIC US.

02:36 AND THE IMAGE PROBLEM EVEN AS SOME OF THESE INTERACTIONS WERE

02:40 INNOCENT EVEN IF YOU BELIEVE JUSTICE ALITO IT DOESN'T LOOK

02:41 GOOD. MOST AMERICANS DON'T BELIEVE

02:43 THAT THIS IS INNOCENT. SO THE COURT HAS EVERY REASON

02:49 TO INVEST IN ETHICS REFORM BUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN MUCH INTEREST

02:53 IN IT THAT -- AT LEAST TO DATE. JOE:

02:57 YOU MENTIONED PARTISANSHIP ON THE COURT OR AT LEAST A FEW OF

02:58 PARTISANSHIP. I WONDER HOW THAT JIVES WITH

03:01 THE DECISION TODAY.

03:07 THE SUPREME COURT CITING WITH THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION ABOUT

03:10 IMMIGRATION POLICY, ABOUT DEPORTATION AND DETENTION AT

03:13 THE BORDER. IT WAS 8-1, MARY. WHAT DOES THAT TELL US?

03:19 >> THE COURT IS KIND OF REVERTING TO FORM ON THIS

03:20 PARTISANSHIP ON THE COURT IS THE MOST EVIDENT IN THE CASES

03:26 THAT INVOLVE THE MOST PARTISAN ISSUES, RIGHT?

03:31 SO I THINK MANY OF US ARE GOING TO BE SURPRISED IF WE DON'T SEE

03:35 A SWEEP OF BIG CONSERVATIVE WINS AS THE COURT WRAPS UP ITS

03:40 CASES FOR THE TERM BUT WE HAVE GENERALLY SEEN I THINK THUS FAR

03:42 THIS TERM SOME MORE SURPRISING RULES FROM THE COURT WE HAVE

03:48 SEEN JUSTICE GORSUCH SIDE WITH NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES WHICH

03:53 HAS BEEN A HARM MARK OF THIS JURISPRUDENCE ALL THE WAY TO

03:56 HIS TIME ON THE 10TH CIRCUIT AND WE HAVE SEEN JUSTICES

04:01 KAVANAUGH AND BARRETT PEEL AWAY MORE OFTEN FROM THEIR MORE

04:05 CONSERVATIVE COLLEAGUES JUSTICES THOMAS AND ALITO ON A

04:06 NUMBER OF RULINGS TOO. WHETHER THAT TREND LASTS IN THE

04:13 CASES THAT WE THINK OF AS A CULTURE WAR CASES CASES ON

04:16 THINGS LIKE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION OR LGBTQ RIGHTS I THINK IT

04:25 REMAINS TO BE SEEN TO SEE THE CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES REUNITE

04:26 IN THOSE CASES BUT SOMETIMES WHEN THE SPOTLIGHT ISN'T AS

04:30 BRIGHT WE WILL SEE FRACTURES IN THE CONSERVATIVE MAJORITY THEN

04:32 WE HAVE THIS YEAR. JOE: SO WE DO HAVE SOME BIG DAYS

04:40 COMING NEXT WEEK THEY HAVE SET ASIDE TUESDAY FOR OPINIONS AND

04:41 THEY WILL LIKELY ADD ANOTHER DAY.

04:44 AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IS GOING TO BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST CASES YOU

04:47 MENTIONED THAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR HERE AND I UNDERSTAND EIGHT

04:50 STATES INCLUDING CALIFORNIA OF ALL HAVE BAND RACE BASED

04:56 ADMISSIONS ALREADY IS THERE A CASE STUDY FOR WHAT MIGHT

04:58 HAPPEN IF THE COURT STRIKES IT DOWN?

05:02 >> >> I THINK THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS HERE IF THE COURT

05:05 SAYS AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL IT DEPENDS ON

05:09 WHY AND WHAT THE COURT LEAVES OPEN WE HAVE SEEN FOR EXAMPLE

05:14 CHALLENGES TO SOME OF THE RACE CONTROLLED ALTERNATIVES THAT

05:15 SOME STATES PURSUE.

05:23 YOU ADMIT THE TOP 10% OR TOP 1% OF STUDENTS IN EACH PUBLIC

05:27 SCHOOL DISTRICT WHICH TENDS TO INCREASE DIVERSITY OF VARIOUS

05:30 KINDS BECAUSE OF RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION IF THE SUPREME

05:32 COURT SIGNALS THAT THAT MIGHT NOT BE OK EITHER THAT MIGHT BE

05:36 TO RACE-BASED OR IF THE SUPREME COURT SIGNALS THAT STUDENTS

05:41 WILL HAVE WHAT THEY WRITE THAT COULD MAKE IT THE EFFECTIVE

05:47 DECISION MUCH MORE RADICAL I THINK EVERYONE IS EXPECTING THE

05:51 SUPREME COURT TO SAY IT'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN SOME WAY OR

05:55 ANOTHER BUT HOW FAR THE COURT GOES AND WHETHER IT GOES FOR IN

05:59 THIS DECISION WILL LEAVE SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS FOR ANOTHER

06:01 DAY WILL DETERMINE THE FATE OF WHAT COMES NEXT. JOE:

06:04 SOME OF THE OTHER CASES WE TALKED ABOUT HERE INCLUDING

06:08 STUDENT ON FORGIVENESS AND THE SO-CALLED ELECTIONS THEORY IT'S

06:12 POSSIBLE THE COURT WILL NOT ACTUALLY DELIVER IN OPINION ON

06:13 THEM DO YOU THINK?

06:18 >> >> I THINK WE'VE SEEN SOME SIGNS IN THE COURTS OTHER

06:21 RULINGS THERE MIGHT BE SOME SKEPTICISM ABOUT STANDING IN

06:24 THE STUDENT ON FORGIVENESS CASE THERE MAY BE A SENSE THAT THE

06:29 COURT JUST DOESN'T THAT THESE CASES ARE RIPE OR READY FOR

06:33 PRIME TIME AND I THINK I FOR ONE ESPECIALLY THE INDEPENDENT

06:35 STATE LEGISLATURE WE HAD A KIND OF UNIQUE LINE-UP OF A FRIEND

06:42 OF THE COURT BRIEFS IN THE CASE FROM CONSERVATIVES AS WELL AS

06:44 PROGRESSES REALLY URGING THE COURT NOT TO ADOPT A DOCTRINE

06:48 THAT COULD REALLY ALLOW FOR A LOT OF ELECTIONS SUBVERSION SO

06:55 IF THE COURT FINDS A WAY TO GRACEFULLY IGNORE OR SET ASIDE

06:58 THAT CASE I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE IDEOLOGICAL

07:00 SPECTRUM WILL BE RELIEVED IN THE STUDENT ON FORGIVENESS CASE

07:05 WE HAVE SEEN SIGNS THERE MAY BE A REAL PROBLEM STANDING.

07:11 JOE: WE LIKE TO STAY CLOSE WITH YOU
