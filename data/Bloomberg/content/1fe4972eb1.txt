You do not have to like Nigel Farage to recognize that he is one of the most consequential politicians of our time. He terrified the Conservatives into Brexit, first by founding a political party, UKIP, that campaigned for a referendum and then by founding another one, the Brexit Party, that campaigned for the full-strength version. Now he is taking a wrecking ball to corporate wokery.

A brief recap: Coutts & Co, a private bank that lists King Charles among its clients and is part of the NatWest Group Plc, decided that it no longer wanted Farage on its rolls. It claimed that it was removing him for purely commercial reasons — he no longer reached the financial threshold for maintaining an account of £3 million in savings or £1 million in investments — but when Farage obtained an internal document reviewing his case a darker story emerged.
