In his interview last week with Donald Trump, Tucker Carlson repeatedly asked Trump if “they’re going to try and kill you.”

It’s only natural to focus on the word “kill” in that query, a word that Carlson employed to conjure visions – and perhaps the reality — of political violence. Carlson, after all, is in the demagogue business, for which hatred and bloodshed are profitable lines. But the operative word in Carlson’s question was not “kill.” It was “they” – that pervasive yet curiously unspecific constant in the rhetoric of political degenerates and con artists.
