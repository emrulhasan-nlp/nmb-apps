00:14 >> THE INFLATION PROBLEM IS NOT GOING AWAY.

00:18 IT WILL CREATE RISK OF FINANCIAL STABILITY ISSUES DOWN

00:19 THE ROAD.

00:23 >> I DO SEE THIS BUILDING THAT COULD JEOPARDIZE DISINFLATION.

00:29 >> EVERY SINGLE INVESTOR PRICING IN A SOFT LANDING GETS

00:31 ME QUITE NERVOUS.

00:35 >> ALL WE NEED IS A TINY WITH OF LESS DOVISH DATA AND THAT

00:40 WOULD ALREADY BE ENOUGH TO SAID PAIN ACROSS ASSET CLASSES.

00:44 >> IF WE WERE GOING TO GET A SURPRISE ON CPI THEN FOLKS

00:47 WOULD SAY IS THIS REALLY OVERHEATING?

00:55 >> THIS IS "BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE"

00:56 WITH JONATHAN FERRO, LISA ABRAMOWICZ, AND IN REORDERED.

00:59 JONATHAN: THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE

01:06 ALONGSIDE LISA ABRAMOWICZ TOGETHER WITH ANNMARIE HORDERN.

01:09 TYPICALLY WE START THIS PROGRAM TALKING ABOUT INFLATION BUT YOU

01:14 DO NOT WANT TO MISS THE LISA ABRAMOWICZ RANT ON SCHOOLS IN

01:21 NEW YORK CITY.

01:23 THEY SAVE, NEW YORKERS. -- STAY SAFE, NEW YORKERS.

01:31 PARTS OF NEW JERSEY AND PENNSYLVANIA COULD SEE AS MUCH

01:33 AS 12 INCHES. LISA: HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO THIS?

01:37 JONATHAN: I AM GOING TO KEEP GOING.

01:43 REMOTE LEARNING, THOUGHTS? LISA: IT IS ADDING INSULT TO INJURY

01:46 AS A PARENTS. HAVING YOUR KIDS HOME IS A PAIN

01:49 IN THE NECK. THEN TO HAVE TO OVERSEE THEM

01:55 AND THEIR LEARNING AND GET ON THEIR CASE FOR NOT DOING THEIR

01:58 HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS WHILE THEY WERE LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW

02:01 HOPING TO GO SLEDDING AND FEELING CAGED IN AND ARGUING

02:02 WITH EACH OTHER IS TOO MUCH. JONATHAN:

02:06 AS FAR AS THEY ARE CONCERNED TO THEY BELIEVE IT IS A SNOW DAY

02:09 OR DO THEY BELIEVE THEY HAVE TO LEARN SOMETHING? LISA:

02:13 THEY THINK THEY HAVE 10 MINUTES OF LOGGING ON AND TAKING

02:14 ATTENDANCE AND THEY CAN GO OUTSIDE.

02:17 I ASSUME THEY HAVE WORK THEY CAN GET DONE AND I ASSUME IS

02:20 THE PARENT I HAVE TO OVERSEE IT. I THINK YOU GIVE A SNOW DAY OR

02:24 YOU DO NOT. THIS HALF HALF MAKES IT MORE OF

02:28 A BURDEN FOR THE PARENTS. WE WILL KEEP YOU UPDATED WITH

02:33 LISA'S OPINION AND GET REAL UPDATES WITH DANI BURGER.

02:37 STAY SAFE IF YOU ARE COMMUTING THIS MORNING.

02:39 LET'S TURN TO THE INFLATION DATA.

02:44 WE ARE LOOKING FOR A TWO HANDLE ON CPI YEAR-OVER-YEAR ON THE

02:45 HEADLINE. 2.9% IS THE ESTIMATE.

02:51 3.4% IS THE PREVIOUS READ. WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING

02:54 CLOSER TO 4%. LISA: YOU ARE LOOKING AT

03:00 YEAR-OVER-YEAR GOING IN BELOW 3% FOR THE FIRST TIME GOING

03:02 BACK TO 2021. THE ACTUAL COMPONENTS, THE

03:07 BROADENING OUT, THAT SEEMS TO BE THE KEY PHRASE FOR A LOT OF

03:09 FED OFFICIALS. THE IDEA IS IS IT JUST PRODUCTS?

03:17 IS IT JUST FOOD AND ENERGY OR IS THERE SOMETHING FURTHER

03:19 UNDER THE HOOD? JONATHAN: WHAT IS THE RISK WE STABILIZED

03:25 NORTH OF THE 2% INFLATION TARGET?

03:27 THAN THE POLITICAL SPIN WILL BEGIN.

03:31 I WILL ARGUE THE POLITICAL SPIN STARTED BEFORE THE SUPER BOWL

03:33 WHEN THE PRESIDENT RELEASED A BUILDING. ANNMARIE:

03:38 THE PRESIDENT RELEASED A VIDEO FROM HIS CAMPAIGN ACCOUNT.

03:43 YESTERDAY THE PRESIDENT WENT AFTER CORPORATIONS, CALLING IT

03:47 GREEDFLATION AND SHRINKFLATION. HE IS NOT MENTIONING BRANDS BY

03:50 NAME.

03:57 HE DID MENTION SNICKERS BUT HE WAS WRONG THAT THE SNICKERS BAR

03:58 DID NOT SHRINK. EVERY TIME WE GET THE CPI

04:02 REPORT HE SAYS MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE, BUT TREASURY

04:06 SECRETARY JANET YELLEN ONCE TO DECLARE VICTORY ON THE SOFT

04:07 LANDING. JONATHAN: IS THIS THE STANDARD OF THE

04:11 CONVERSATION IN D.C.? LISA: THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

04:16 SNICKERS BARS? ON ONE HAND WE ARE TALKING

04:19 ABOUT THE SNICKERS BARS ARE NOT BIG ENOUGH -- HOW DO YOU

04:23 MESSAGE SOMETHING THAT IS GOOD PROGRESS BUT PEOPLE ARE STILL

04:26 FEELING THE TWO YEAR CUMULATIVE INFLATION.

04:29 THE KEY IS TO TALK ABOUT WHERE PROGRESS NEEDS TO HAPPEN AND

04:32 TREAT PEOPLE LIKE THEY ARE SMART AND THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT

04:33 THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT. JONATHAN:

04:37 THERE IS A BILL WORKING ITS WAY THROUGH THE SENATE AT 6:00 IN

04:43 THE MORNING DOWN IN WASHINGTON, D.C.

04:47 YOU TOLD ME THEY HAVE TURNED UP IN GYM CLOTHES. ANNMARIE:

04:53 SOME OF THEM ARE BEING WOKEN UP TO GET BACK TO THE SENATE FLOOR

04:55 TO VOTE ON THIS AND IT LOOKS LIKE THEY HAVE THE NUMBERS BUT

04:56 THE BOAT IS STILL OPEN. THEY WILL BE PASSING $95

05:02 BILLION IN THE SENATE FOR ISRAEL, TAIWAN, AND UKRAINE.

05:06 LAST NIGHT THE LAST THING I READ WAS SPEAKER JOHNSON SAYING

05:10 THIS IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE HOUSE.

05:14 IN THE ABSENCE OF HAVING RECEIVED ANY BORDER POLICY

05:17 CHANGE THE HOUSE WILL WORK ITS OWN WILL ON THESE IMPORTANT

05:20 MATTERS. LISA:

05:26 I RANT ABOUT SCHOOLS ANY RANT ABOUT WHAT THE SENATORS WHERE.

05:28 JONATHAN: I WAS JUST CURIOUS. IT WAS THE FIRST THING ANNMARIE

05:31 TOLD ME. I THINK IT IS DISRESPECTFUL TO

05:34 THE OFFICE. S&P FUTURES -.4%.

05:41 IN THE BOND MARKET DOWN ABOUT A BASIS POINTS. 4.1696.

05:48 COMING UP THIS HOUR, CHRIS VERRONE OF STRATEGAS.

05:58 NORMAN ROULE, AND JENNIFER LEE. WE BEGIN WITH OUR TOP STORY.

06:04 THE EQUITY RALLY COOLING AHEAD OF THIS MORNING'S CPI PRINT.

06:09 CHRIS VERRONE SAYING EVEN IF WE GET A PULLBACK IN EQUITIES, THE

06:11 FLOOR IS HIGH. TRENDS REMAIN OVERWHELMINGLY

06:16 POSITIVE FOR A 50 DAY SUPPORT ON THE S&P 500 AT ROUGHLY 4770

06:27 AT LONG-TERM WORST-CASE 4600. WE GOT THE BANK OF AMERICA FUND

06:30 MANAGER SURVEY EARLY. I WILL GO THROUGH THE MOST

06:33 CROWDED TRADES. LONG MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, 61% OF

06:40 RESPONDENT SHORT CHINA, ALONG JAPAN, LONG CASH.

06:45 OVERWHELMINGLY, LONG MAGNIFICENT SEVEN.

06:48 HOW CONCENTRATED ARE SOME OF THE ACTIONS YOU'VE SEEN OVER

06:49 THE LAST MONTH OR SO? CHRIS: IT IS ONE-SIDED IN TERMS OF

06:53 LEADERSHIP. THIS IDEA THAT IT SAID STOCKS

06:59 WORKING THE ENTIRE MARKET IS MISLEADING.

07:02 YOU HAVE THE SMALL CAPS RIGHT NOW.

07:05 GIVE THE S&P MAKING TWO YEAR HIGHS. IT HAS BEEN A HIGH BAR.

07:13 THE GOOD NEWS IS THE OTHER STUFF , THE OTHER 490 STOCKS,

07:17 THEY ARE NOT GOING DOWN IN PRICE.

07:20 WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE HEALTH OF THE MARKET, YOU STILL HAVE TO

07:23 ARGUE IT IS PRETTY BROAD. IT IS WELL PARTICIPATED.

07:28 YOU COULD GET A SEASONAL OR SENTIMENT INDUCED PULLBACK.

07:37 AS WE WROTE 4600 OR 4650 WOULD BE WORST-CASE IN TERMS OF ANY

07:38 SEASONAL WEAKNESS. JONATHAN: WHEN WE SPOKE TO YOU CLOSER TO

07:42 THE START OF THE YEAR YOU WERE TALKING UP FINANCIALS INTO 2024.

07:47 WHAT IS THE STATE OF PLAY NOW AFTER THAT SPEEDBUMP WITH NYC

07:51 BE A FEW WEEKS AGO? CHRIS: IT IS REMARKABLE HOW QUICKLY

07:58 PEOPLE WANT TO GO BACK TO THE IMAGERY OF LAST FEBRUARY AND

07:59 LAST MARCH. I THINK IT LOOKS DIFFERENT THIS

08:02 TIME AROUND. AS THE BANKS AND THE REGIONALS

08:07 HAVE SOLD OFF, WHAT YOU HAVE NOT SEEN AT ALL IS ANY STRESS

08:12 IN FINANCIAL CREDIT. THAT IS A VERY BIG DIFFERENCE

08:17 FROM A YEAR AGO WHEN YOU BEGIN TO SEE STRESS PERMEATE THROUGH

08:19 THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM THROUGH THE AVENUE OF CREDIT.

08:24 THE OTHER THING YOU HAVE NOT SEEN, UNLIKE LAST YEAR WHEN THE

08:26 REGIONALS CAME UNDER PRESSURE, YOU BEGIN TO SEE THIS

08:29 PERSISTENT BID FOR THE MARKETS MORE DEFENSIVE CORNERS.

08:33 YOU SAW IT WITH STAPLES AND UTILITIES.

08:36 IF I WILL EVALUATE THE CORRECTION WE HAVE SEEN IN THE

08:39 REGIONAL OR THE REAL ESTATE NAMES OR THE BANKS OVER THE

08:43 LAST THREE OR FOUR WEEKS, I LOOK TO IT AS VIABLE.

08:48 THE TRENDS ARE POSITIVE UNDER THE SURFACE.

08:51 AT A MINIMUM LET'S GIVE THEM A LEASH TO RESPOND TO THIS

08:52 OVERSOLD CONDITION. LISA: BUYING REGIONALS OR BUYING

08:57 FINANCIALS? JONATHAN: YESTERDAY -- CHRIS:

09:03 YESTERDAY WAS A GREAT EXAMPLE FOR SOFTNESS AT THE TOP OF THE

09:04 MARKET. USE OUR REGIONALS AND BANKS

09:08 ACTED VERY WELL OFF OF SUPPORT. I THINK YOU WILL GET A GOOD

09:12 OVERSOLD RESPONSE. THE QUESTIONABLE PARTS OF THE

09:16 MARKET. THE REGIONALS, THE RATES.

09:24 WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BANKS MORE BROADLY CAPITAL MARKET STOCKS

09:26 BEGIN TO ACT WELL. CONSUMER FINANCE NAMES CONTINUE

09:29 TO TRADE WELL. AMERICAN EXPRESS AND CAPITAL

09:33 ONE AND ALLIED FINANCIAL. IT IS OFTEN PERCEIVED AS ONE OF

09:37 THE WEAKER PARTS OF FINANCIALS TRADE QUITE WELL. JONATHAN:

09:42 AT THIS POINT -- LISA: AT THIS POINT IT IS SORT OF A

09:46 TEST. TO HAVE A DOWNSIDE THAT IS NOT THAT DOWN IS FAIRLY

09:49 BULLISH BUT THE UPSIDE BEING DRIVEN BY SMALL CAPS IS NEXT

09:50 LEVEL. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW THE

09:55 CONSOLIDATION WE HAVE SEEN IS FAR FROM THE DOOM AND GLOOM

09:56 PEOPLE TALK ABOUT. IS THAT ENOUGH TO GET IN AND

09:59 BET ON THE BROADENING OUT THAT HAS YET TO HAPPEN? CHRIS:

10:06 I THINK THE STORY THAT THE BROADENING OUT IS YET TO HAPPEN

10:07 IS MISLEADING. WE ARE ONLY SIX WEEKS FROM SOME

10:12 OF THE BEST READINGS WE HAVE SEEN IN 60 OR 70 YEARS WORTH OF

10:13 DATA. DECEMBER 14 YOU HAD MORE

10:20 SMALL-CAP STOCKS MAKE A HIGH. THE ONLY CRIME THEY HAVE

10:25 COMMITTED IN THE ENSUING SIX WEEKS IS CONSOLIDATING THAT

10:26 MOVE. THIS IDEA THAT THE BROADENING

10:30 NEVER HAPPENED IS MISLEADING. I THINK IT BEGAN TO HAPPEN IN

10:33 THE FOURTH QUARTER. WE HAVE PAUSED.

10:37 ALL SIGNS POINT TO RE-ENGAGING. YESTERDAY WAS REALLY

10:40 INTERESTING. THE S&P FINISHED LOWER BUT YOU

10:45 HAD MORE STOCKS UP THAN THE HIGHEST RATING WE HAVE HAD ALL

10:46 YEAR. INTERNALLY WE LOOKED GOOD, YOU

10:52 HAVE THE SMALL CAPS START TO BREAK OUT.

10:55 LET'S GIVE THIS MORE LEASH TO RE-EXPAND. JONATHAN:

10:59 IS BECAUSE THE EXCITEMENT IS ELSEWHERE.

11:02 WE ARE LOOKING AT STOCKS THAT HAVE DOUBLED IN THREE DAYS AND

11:03 TRIPLED SINCE THE IPO. NVIDIA IS FLYING AGAIN.

11:08 I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE CONSUMER JUST BRIEFLY.

11:11 WE HAVE CPI LATER THIS MORNING. IN A COUPLE OF DAYS WE HAVE

11:14 RETAIL SALES. IF YOU LOOK AT STAPLES VERSUS

11:18 DISCRETIONARY, WHAT IS THE SIGNAL YOU TAKE? CHRIS:

11:24 WE SAY WE WILL TAKE THE MARKET INTUITION OVER OUR OWN ANY DAY

11:26 OF THE WEEK. THE MARKET IS THE BEST

11:29 ECONOMIST I KNOW. THE DISCRETIONARY IS A VERY

11:33 GOOD BAROMETER FOR HOW THE MARKET PERCEIVES THE ECONOMY.

11:38 THAT MADE NEW HIGHS YESTERDAY AND SODAS TRANSPORT UTILITIES.

11:44 ALL OF THE RESPIROMETER'S I WOULD LOOK AT TO GAUGE -- ALL

11:47 THE RISK BAROMETERS I WOULD LOOK AT ARE STILL IN GOOD SHAPE.

11:52 YOU MENTIONED TO SOME OF THE STORIES ARE BROUGHT.

11:55 YOU HAVE A LOT OF NEW HIGHS. YOU HAVE TAIWAN AT NEW HIGHS.

12:00 CAREER BREAKING OUT. -- KOREA BREAKING OUT.

12:08 IMPORTANTLY, EARLY SIGNS OF CAPITULATION IN CHINA, WHICH IS

12:10 INTERESTING TO US. JONATHAN: THE MOST UNLOVED EQUITY MARKET

12:13 IN THE WORLD. DO YOU LIKE IT ENOUGH?

12:19 CHRIS: PERU'S THE FINANCIAL TIMES, NEW

12:21 YORK TIMES, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL YOU CANNOT FIND A

12:24 BULLISH WORD WRITTEN. YOU HAD 82% OF THE SHANGHAI

12:28 COMPOSITE EXCEPT FOR THE WORST PART -- SOMETHING THERE IS

12:32 CHANGING RIGHT NOW. I WOULD COVER YOUR SHORTS.

12:36 I WOULD LOOK THE PRICE ACTION. LOOK AT THE BREAKOUT IN WIND.

12:42 LOOK AT THE TURNING DOWN OF CHINA.

12:44 SOMETHING IS HAPPENING THERE. AT A MINIMUM THE BEARS HAVE TO

12:47 COVER SHORTS. JONATHAN: CHRIS VERRONE ON THE MOST LOVED

12:52 EQUITY MARKET ON THE PLANET. I WILL GO BACK OVER THE FUND

12:56 MANAGER SURVEY FROM BANK OF AMERICA.

12:58 WE'RE LOOKING AT THE MOST CROWDED TRADES.

13:01 LONG MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. NUMBER TWO, SHORT CHINESE

13:04 EQUITIES. LISA: TO DAMIAN SASSOWER OUR'S POINT

13:12 IS THAT A TRADE, MAYBE NOT AN INVESTMENT.

13:15 SOMETHING IS HAPPENING. TAKE A LOOK AT MGM.

13:22 IT SHOWS HOW RISK ON PEOPLE ARE, THAT THEY'RE WILLING TO

13:23 SATE THE TECHNICALS ARE SO BAD IT CANNOT GET WORSE.

13:27 WE WILL THROW A FEW DOLLARS INTO THAT AREA. JONATHAN:

13:32 IT IS THE PLACE WHERE SENTIMENT IS ROCK-BOTTOM.

13:35 EQUITY FUTURES NEAR SESSION BLOWS, DOWN .4%.

13:39 LET'S GET UPDATE ON STORIES ELSEWHERE.

13:41 HERE IS THE BLOOMBERG BRIEF WITH DANI BURGER. DANI:

13:47 NEW YORK CITY RESIDENTS ARE BORN TO STAY HOME TODAY.

13:52 THE CITY IS FORECAST TO RECEIVE AT LEAST EIGHT INCHES OF SNOW.

13:54 ERIC ADAMS CLOSED SCHOOL.

14:00 IF THERE WERE MORE THAN 7.3 INCHES IN CENTRAL PARK IT WOULD

14:02 BE THE MOST SINCE 2022. NORTHERN NEW JERSEY AND EASTERN

14:06 PENNSYLVANIA COULD SEE AS MUCH AS 12 INCHES TODAY.

14:10 FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HAS ENDORSED HIS

14:13 DAUGHTER-IN-LAW TO HELP LEAD THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL

14:16 COMMITTEE. FORMER TELEVISION PRODUCER LARA

14:18 TRUMP IS MARRIED TO HIS SON ERIC.

14:22 THE MOVE WOULD TIGHTEN FROM SCRIPT ON THE PARTY.

14:25 THE CURRENT CHAIRWOMAN RONNA MCDANIEL IS IN DISCUSSIONS TO

14:28 STEP DOWN. SUNDAY'S SUPER BOWL WAS FROM

14:31 FROM THE HISTORY BOOKS.

14:37 THE FIRST BACK-TO-BACK WIN IN 19 YEARS AND THE MOST VIEWERS.

14:48 THAT IS A 7% INCREASE FROM THE PREVIOUS HIGH, SET LAST YEAR.

14:52 BEDDING ALSO SET A RECORD WITH GAMBLERS IN NEVADA WAGING --

14:57 THAT IS YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF. JONATHAN: APPRECIATE IT.

15:03 SURPRISED? LISA: ABOUT THE RECORD? NO.

15:09 WE WERE ALL EXPECTING IT. JONATHAN:

15:12 THE TAYLOR SWIFT AFFECT. IS THAT WHAT WE ARE SEEING?

15:16 ANNMARIE: DEARLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT HER

15:17 AGAIN? JONATHAN: I WANT TO TALK ABOUT JIM NANCE

15:22 OF CBSSPORTS. ABSOLUTE LEGEND. LISA: YOU'RE TALKING GOLF?

15:30 YOU'RE BASICALLY SAYING LET'S SHIFT GEARS FROM THE SUPER BOWL

15:31 TO TALK ABOUT GOLF. JONATHAN: LET'S NOT.

15:39 UP NEXT, PRESIDENT BIDEN PUSHING FOR A PAUSE IN GUYS A

15:42 -- A PAUSE IN GAZA. PRES. BIDEN: THE UNITED STATES IS WORKING ON

15:50 A HOSTAGE DEAL BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS WHICH WOULD BRING

15:52 SUSTAINED CALM FOR AT LEAST SIX WEEKS. JONATHAN:

15:55 THAT IS COMING UP NEXT. LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY.

15:59 THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

16:13 JONATHAN: CPI DATA LATER THIS MORNING.

16:16 EQUITY FUTURES A LITTLE BIT SOFTER.

16:19 NEGATIVE ONE THIRD OF 1%. DOWN A SINGLE BASIS POINT.

16:27 UNDER SURVEILLANCE, PRESIDENT BIDEN PUSHING FOR A PAUSE IN

16:28 GAZA. PRES. BIDEN: AS THE KING AND I DISCUSSED

16:33 TODAY, THE UNITED STATES IS WORKING ON A HOSTAGE DEAL

16:37 BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS WHICH WOULD BRING IMMEDIATE AND

16:41 SUSTAINED. OF CALM TO GAZA FOR AT LEAST

16:45 SIX WEEKS, WHICH WE COULD THEN TAKE THE TIME TO BUILD

16:47 SOMETHING MORE ENDURING. JONATHAN:

16:54 PRESIDENT BIDEN PUSHING FOR A SIX WEEKS PAUSE IN FIGHTING

16:55 BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS. THE MEETING AMID GROWING

17:00 CONCERN ABOUT A POTENTIAL ISRAELI GROUND OFFENSIVE IN A

17:02 CITY WERE OVER ONE MILLION PALESTINIANS HAVE FLED.

17:06 KING ABDULLAH CALLING FOR AN END TO THE WAR, SAY WE CANNOT

17:10 AFFORD AN ISRAELI ATTACK ON RAFAH. IT IS CERTAIN TO PRODUCE

17:13 ANOTHER HUMANITARIAN CATASTROPHE.

17:22 JOINING US IS NORMAN ROULE, FORMER U.S.

17:23 INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL. COULD WE TAKE A STEP BACK AND

17:27 LOOK AT THE ORIGINAL OBJECTIVE OF THE ISRAELI MILITARY, WHICH

17:30 WAS TO DESTROY HAMAS. MUCH PROGRESS HAVE THEY MADE?

17:38 NORMAN: THAT DIMINISHING THE SIGNIFICANT HUMANITARIAN

17:42 CATASTROPHE OF GAZA, ISRAEL HAS ACHIEVED SIGNIFICANT SUCCESS

17:45 AGAINST THE LOSS -- AGAINST HAMAS.

17:47 HAMAS HAD FIVE FOR GRADES. TWO IN THE NORTH HAVE BEEN

17:51 DESTROYED. THE TWO IN THE CENTER HAVE BEEN

17:54 DEGRADED. THE FINAL PER GRADE IS LOCATED

18:00 IN -- THE FINAL BRIGADE IS LOCATED IN ROUGH. -- IN RAFAH.

18:10 CONCENTRATION OF CIVILIANS IS WHY THE UNITED STATES WAS

18:14 PUSHING FOR A LESS INTENSE CONFLICT AGAINST THE REMAINING

18:15 LEADERSHIP. ANNMARIE:

18:21 HOW DOES ISRAEL GO INTO RABAA TO GET RID OF THE REMAINDER OF

18:27 HAMAS AND MAKE SURE THEY ARE MAKING SURE THEY ARE PROTECTING

18:28 PALESTINIAN CIVILIANS? NORMAN: THEY ONLY HAVE TWO CHOICES.

18:35 FIRST THEY UNDERTAKE A LONG CAMPAIGN TO DEGRADE THE

18:40 REMAINING HAMAS BRIGADE BUT ALSO TO GO AGAINST THE TUNNELS

18:41 UNDER RAFAH. THIS IS WHERE THE FIGHTERS ARE

18:45 HIDING. THIS WOULD BE A LONG AND COSTLY

18:48 BATTLE. THE ALTERNATIVE IS TO MOVE THE

18:53 CIVILIANS OUT. THE PROBLEM IS THERE NOT MANY

18:56 PLACES TO GO. THEY COULD SEND THEM NORTH

18:59 AGAIN. NOT A LOT OF FACILITIES FOR

19:03 THEM IN THAT AREA. THEY COULD WORK AROUND THEM.

19:09 IT IS VERY COMPLICATED. ANNMARIE:

19:15 YOU HAD THE HEAD MEETING WITH BILL BURNS.

19:18 IF THEY GO AHEAD WITH A HOSTAGE AGREEMENT WITH THAT MEAN ISRAEL

19:21 WOULD NOT GO INTO RAFAH? NORMAN: ISRAEL WOULD SAY A HOSTAGE

19:27 AGREEMENT WOULD DELAY GOING INTO RAFAH.

19:31 HAMAS WOULD PUSH FOR A LENGTHY HOSTAGE AGREEMENT WHICH WOULD

19:33 ALLOW THEM TO SURVIVE AND DECLARE VICTORY THROUGH

19:34 SURVIVAL. IF YOU ARE HAMAS SURVIVAL MEANS

19:39 VICTORY, AND THEN DOMINATING THE POSTWAR ENVIRONMENT AND IN

19:43 ESSENCE RESTORING A MODEST DOMINATION OF GAZA AND THE WEST

19:44 BANK. LISA: HOW MUCH ARE YOU CONCERNED

19:51 ABOUT BENJAMIN NETANYAHU AND HOW MUCH THE NEWS REPORTS SEEM

19:55 TO SUGGEST HE IS GOING IT ALONE AND DEFYING A LOT OF BIDEN AND

19:56 WHAT HE IS SAYING? DOES THAT GIVE YOU PAUSE?

20:00 NORMAN: IT IS A CONCERN BUT I THINK

20:06 PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU DOES REFLECT A GENUINE BELIEF IN

20:09 ISRAEL THAT THEY CANNOT SUSTAIN ANOTHER SITUATION WHERE HAMAS

20:13 MIGHT RETURN AND REPEAT WHAT IT DID OCTOBER 7.

20:16 IT IS FAIR TO SAY PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU REFLECTS A

20:20 HARD LINE OF THE RIGHT WING BUT IT WOULD BE UNFAIR TO SAY HE IS

20:23 THE ONLY PERSON THAT BELIEVES HAMAS MUST BE DESTROYED IN A

20:28 NEW SITUATION IN GAZA MUST DEVELOP IN A TWO STATE SOLUTION

20:31 SHOULD NOT BE RUSHED INTO BECAUSE THAT MIGHT MEAN A HAMAS

20:34 DOMINATED ENTITY ON THE ISRAELI BORDER. LISA:

20:39 THERE ARE SENATORS IN THEIR PAJAMAS VOTING ON THIS BILL TO

20:41 GET AID TO UKRAINE IN ISRAEL. IT IS DEAD IN THE WATER BECAUSE

20:44 THE HOUSES DOCTORING TO BRING IT.

20:48 ELON MUSK TALKING TO SENATORS SAYING THERE IS NO WAY VLADIMIR

20:54 PUTIN CAN USE THE WAR IN UKRAINE .

20:59 WHAT DOES -- WHAT YOU MAKE OF THAT? HOW CONCERNING MS. THAT?

21:03 NORMAN: IT IS CONCERNING. IT MAY BE POLITICALLY POPULAR

21:09 TO DENY AID TO EITHER PARTY, BUT PROVIDING PRECISION GUIDED

21:13 MISSIONS AND STRONG INTELLIGENCE TO PROTECT

21:16 CIVILIANS AND IT ENABLES THOSE PARTNERS WE SUPPORT TO WIN OR

21:20 SUSTAIN THEIR DEFENSE. IT IS AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

21:26 IF YOU DENY PRECISION GUIDED MUNITIONS AND INTELLIGENCE, YOU

21:31 LENGTHEN THE FIGHT, INCREASE CIVILIAN CASUALTIES, IN YOU.

21:32 UNDERMINE THEIR WILL TO FIGHT. JONATHAN: U.S.

21:36 RHETORIC IS SHIFTING. PRIVATE MEETINGS ARE SUGGESTING

21:41 JOE BIDEN IS CALLING THE ISRAELI LEADER AN A-HOLE THREE

21:47 TIMES SEPARATELY. THAT IS A SHIFT IN RHETORIC.

21:53 MAY BE CONVENIENTLY FROM THIS WHITE HOUSE.

21:56 HAVE YOU SEEN A CHANGE IN POLICY? NORMAN: NO AT PRESENT.

22:01 THE U.S. CONTINUES TO FLOW FORWARD, THE

22:06 COOPERATION OF PLOSSER JUICE IS STRONG, BUT THE U.S.

22:07 IS APPROPRIATELY CONCERNED WITH HOW THE RAFAH CAMPAIGN WILL GO.

22:11 THERE IS NOWHERE TO MOVE THIS POPULATION. IF ISRAEL CONDUCTS A

22:16 TRADITIONAL CAMPAIGN THE CIVILIAN COST WOULD BE ENORMOUS

22:19 WITH HUGE POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES TO DO GUIDED

22:23 STATES AND A DOMESTIC POLITICAL COMPONENT.

22:24 I DO NOT THINK ISRAEL INTENDS TO DO THAT BUT THE CONCERN IN

22:28 THE WHITE HOUSE IS INDEED GENUINE. JONATHAN:

22:32 SOMETIMES IT IS QUIET WITH REGARDS TO REGIONAL ACTORS.

22:36 I AM THINKING OF SAUDI ARABIA. WHAT YOU ANTICIPATE WILL HAPPEN

22:40 WITH THEM TOWARDS THE END OF THE YEAR?

22:43 ARE YOU EXPECTING A SHIFT IN THEIR APPROACH TO THE SITUATION?

22:45 NORMAN: I DO NOT. THE SAUDI'S WILL CONSISTENTLY

22:53 CALL FOR A CEASE-FIRE, A TWO STATE SOLUTION WITH A DEFINITE

22:54 TIME FRAME FOR WHEN THAT SOLUTION MUST COME ABOUT, AND A

22:59 SITUATION WHERE THE HUMANITARIAN ASPECT OF GAZA IS

23:02 RESOLVED. THERE IS ENORMOUS SENSITIVITY

23:07 IN THE ARAB WORLD TO WHAT THEY SEE AS THE DAILY DRUMBEAT OF

23:11 THE DEATH OF PALESTINIAN MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN.

23:14 WE DO NOT HAVE THAT SAME DRUMBEAT IN THE WEST. THE

23:17 SALLIES ARE NOT GOING TO SHIFT. JONATHAN: THANK YOU.

23:21 GOOD TO CATCH UP. FORMER SENIOR U.S.

23:25 INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS AS THE PRESIDENT THE UNITED STATES

23:27 PUSHES FOR A SIX-WEEK PAUSE. CAN WE TALK ABOUT ANGRY BIDEN

23:31 AND HOW CONVENIENT SOME OF THOSE LEAKS MIGHT BE.

23:37 YOU THINK THAT IS MORE ON HIS MENTAL ACUITY THEY WANT TO SHOW

23:39 HIM BEING FOCUSED AND ANGRY BEHIND THE SCENES. ANNMARIE:

23:45 HE IS VERY WELL KNOWN TO HAVE A TEMPER.

23:49 THIS HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED SINCE HE WAS VICE PRESIDENT.

23:52 THESE LEAKS ARE FROM INDIVIDUALS AT DONOR MEETINGS.

23:56 KARINE JEAN-PIERRE WAS ASKED ABOUT THIS AND SHE SAID SHE

23:58 WOULD NOT ELABORATE ON THE PRESIDENTS PRIVATE

23:59 CONVERSATIONS. CLEARLY THERE IS A LOT OF

24:03 FRUSTRATION IN THE WHITE HOUSE BUT ALSO WITHIN THE CAMPAIGN.

24:07 YOU SEE OUTREACH FROM THIS ADMINISTRATION TO GO TO PLACES

24:10 LIKE MICHIGAN WHERE THERE ARE GROUPS SAYING "ABANDON BIDEN"

24:14 THAT FEEL HE HAS TURNED HIS BACK ON THEM. JONATHAN:

24:18 IS A CHANGE IN RHETORIC NOT A CHANGE IN POLICY.

24:23 THE DEMAND FOR AI HELPING CHIP DESIGNER ARM TO DOUBLE IN THREE

24:25 DAYS. THAT CONVERSATION IS COMING UP

24:28 NEXT. LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY, THIS

24:46 JONATHAN: CPI REPORT ABOUT TWO HOURS AWAY.

24:52 NEGATIVE ON THE S&P 500 ABOUT ONE THIRD OF 1%.

24:55 PULLING BACK JUST A TOUCH ON THE S&P, SNAPPING A FOUR DAY

24:59 WINNING STREAK. THE LAST TIME WE HAD A WEEKLY

25:04 LOSS WAS THE FIRST WEEK OF THIS YEAR COME THEN YOU HAVE TO GO

25:06 ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE END OF OCTOBER.

25:08 THAT IS HOW GOOD THINGS HAVE BEEN. YOUR EQUITY MARKET PULLING

25:10 BACK. THE TWO YEAR, 10 YEAR, 30 YEAR

25:14 SHAPING UP AS FOLLOWS. 4.1618.

25:20 TWO YOUR DOWN ALMOST A SINGLE BASIS POINT.

25:22 A QUICK LOOK AT THE EURO. JUST A LITTLE BIT LOWER.

25:29 107.81. POSITIVE .1%. U.S. CPI DATA ON DECK.

25:37 BLOOMBERG SURVEY FORECAST AND ANNUAL RATE OF 2.9%.

25:40 THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST THREE BELOW 3% SINCE MARCH 2021.

25:45 BLOOMBERG EXPECTING HOUSING AND RENTS AND CORE SERVICES TO

25:49 OVERTAKE GOODS AS THE DRIVER OF DISINFLATION.

25:52 THIS CONVERSATION PICKED UP WHEN WE HEARD FROM MR. BARKIN

25:55 OF RICHMOND FED AND HE TALKED ABOUT THE B WORD.

25:58 WE NEED TO SEE THIS BROUGHT AN OUT. LISA:

26:02 I AM HOPEFUL BUT NEED TO SEE CONVICTION OF SLOWING INFLATION

26:05 -- THOSE WERE HIS WORDS. HOW MUCH YOU SEE THIS IN THAT

26:08 DATA? IT SUGGESTS WE WILL. IF YOU DON'T WILL THAT BE

26:14 ENOUGH TO KEEP THE FED ON HOLD? IF WE SEE IT BROUGHT AN OUT, IS

26:18 THAT ENOUGH FOR THEM TO CUT IN MARCH?

26:21 IS THAT WHERE OUR CONVERSATION IS GOING? JONATHAN:

26:26 JUST THIS HAVE THE POTENTIAL -- AND IT DOES THIS HAVE THE

26:29 POTENTIAL TO DIP US INTO A LESS FAVORABLE REGIME.

26:33 I WILL GO INTO THAT QUOTE FROM STUART KAISER OF CITI.

26:39 LISA: AFTER HE CAME ON OUR SHOW AND

26:43 AFTER HE PUT OUT THAT REPORT , CITIGROUP ANALYSTS CAME OUT AND

26:48 WARNED OF A POTENTIAL 1998 SITUATION WHERE THE FED DOES

26:51 CUT RATES BUT THAT IS FORCED TO RAISE THEM AGAIN IN A YEAR OR

26:52 TWO YEARS. HOW MUCH IS STEWART TALKING

26:57 ABOUT EXACTLY THAT TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT WHERE YOU DO NOT

27:01 KILL THE BEAST, IT LINKERS AND YOU END UP IN A DIFFERENT

27:02 REGIME? JONATHAN:

27:03 WITHOUT A DOUBT THAT IS THE SCENARIO SOME FED OFFICIALS ARE

27:08 CLEARING. AND WASHINGTON, D.C. THE U.S. SENATE VOTING TO PASS A

27:14 STANDALONE AID PACKAGE FOR UKRAINE IN ISRAEL.

27:18 LEADERSHIP CONFIDENT THE $95 BILLION WILL PASS TODAY.

27:23 SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON WARNING IT WILL FACE OPPOSITION IN THE

27:26 HOUSE, SAYING "THE HOUSE WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON ITS

27:30 OWN ON THESE IMPORTANT MATTERS." THIS WILL FAIL IN THE HOUSE?

27:35 ANNMARIE: IT WILL ABSOLUTELY FAIL IN THE

27:39 HOUSE AT THE MOMENT. SPEAKER JOHNSON ALREADY POURING

27:40 COLD WATER ON IT.

27:48 THE VOTE STARTED AT 5:15 AM AND MIKE JOHNSON SAID IT WAS DEAD

27:49 IN THE WATER IN THE HOUSE. I AM LOOKING AT THE VOTE COUNT.

27:54 SENATOR CASSIDY HAS NOT VOTED. WE ARE MISSING TWO SENATORS TO

27:57 VOTE. THEY HAVE THE VOTES TO GO THROUGH.

28:03 IT DOES NOT MATTER IF IT PASSES THE SENATE SO IT WILL NOT BE

28:04 PASSING THE HOUSE. JONATHAN: SO WE SHOULD NOT BE TALKING

28:07 ABOUT IT? ANNMARIE: AT SOME POINT, POTENTIALLY,

28:13 THERE COULD BE DIFFERENT AVENUES FOR SOME OF THIS AID.

28:18 THERE IS A LOT OF BIPARTISAN SUPPORT OVERALL FOR THESE

28:20 PROGRAMS. IT IS HOW IT GETS DONE. DO WE DECOUPLE THEM?

28:27 LISA: WHAT DO YOU HAVE IF WE HAVE THE

28:28 LIKES OF J.D. VANCE OF OHIO SAYING THINGS

28:32 LIKE WE HAVE TO KILL THIS THING AND ELON MUSK SAYING VLADIMIR

28:36 PUTIN CANNOT LOSE? WHAT DOES THAT SAY TO OUR

28:40 ALLIES, LET ALONE INTERNALLY? IT RAISES THIS QUESTION OF

28:47 ALLIANCES, A QUESTION OF CONVICTION THE U.S.

28:48 WILL BE THERE IN THE SAME WAY. JONATHAN:

28:54 WHY WE GIVE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUCCESSFUL IN A VERY NARROW

28:55 FIELD A VOICE ON EVERYTHING? ON LITERALLY EVERYTHING?

29:00 IF YOU BECOME HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL IN TECHNOLOGY OR WHATEVER THE

29:05 BUSINESS MIGHT BE, WHY DO WE AS JOURNALISTS GIVE THEM SO MUCH

29:10 OXYGEN TO BASICALLY PONTIFICATE ON EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN?

29:13 LISA: FAIRPOINT. ELON MUSK WAS TALKING TO U.S.

29:18 CONGRESS MEMBERS. IN SOME WAYS THE BUSINESS

29:23 LEADERS HAVE BECOME AMBASSADORS BECAUSE POLITICIANS HAVE NOT

29:27 BEEN AND ARE NOT REPRESENTING THE BUSINESS WORLD IN THE SAME

29:29 WAY AS THEY HAVE TRADITIONALLY. ANNMARIE:

29:32 IF ELON MUSK WAS AROUND THIS TABLE HE WOULD TELL YOU HE HAS

29:38 DONE MORE FOR UKRAINE THAN THE 49 STATES GIVEN WHAT HE HAS

29:41 DONE WITH STARLINK AND THE INTERNET CONNECTION.

29:44 HE HAS HIS OWN SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM.

29:49 HE DECIDED TO CORRAL A BUNCH OF REPUBLICANS WHO WERE AGAINST

29:52 THIS BILL AND SIDED WITH THEM, AND WE WROTE IT UP.

29:58 JONATHAN:

30:04 -- THE AI BOOM, NVIDIA BRIEFLY OVERTOOK THE MARKET SHARE OF

30:08 AMAZON BEFORE SETTLING JUST SHY WITH THE VALUE OF $1.79

30:10 TRILLION. INVESTORS ALL IN ON U.S.

30:13 TECH STOCKS. INVESTORS SING ALLOCATION TO

30:18 TECH IS THE HIGHEST SINCE 2020. ALEX WEBB JOINS US FOR MORE.

30:22 WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THIS AS AN AI FRENZY? ALEX:

30:28 IT CERTAINLY LOOKS THAT WAY, PARTICULAR WITH ARM.

30:35 WHEN ARM FIRST BECAME PUBLIC THERE WAS A CERTAIN MAN OF

30:37 SKEPTICISM ABOUT WHETHER IT WAS REALLY AN AI STOCK.

30:41 IT DID NOT LOOK LIKE IT WAS DELIVERING MUCH VALUE WHEN IT

30:42 CAME TO AI. IT SEEMS THE MARKET IS BUYING

30:47 THAT MESSAGE GIVEN SOME OF THE STATEMENTS MADE LAST WEEK.

30:51 IT DOES NOT HAVE THIS DIRECT EXPOSURE NVIDIA MIGHT HAVE, BUT

30:57 A LOT OF ITS CHIPS DESIGNS ARE USED TO UNDERPIN A LOT OF THESE

31:01 SPECIALIST CHIPS PRODUCED BY THE LIKES OF NVIDIA. LISA:

31:08 YOU HAVE THE UNWANTED JOB OF TRYING TO LABEL WHAT IS REAL

31:09 AND WHAT IS FAKE. WHAT IS OVERHYPED AND WHAT HAS

31:12 LEGS. IS THE SUGGESTION OF NAI BOOST

31:18 THE SALES ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY THE RALLY WE HAVE SEEN IN THE ARM

31:20 SHARES? ALEX:

31:28 I WOULD LOVE TO PICK THE INVESTOR RELATIONS AND SEE IF

31:32 THE FINANCED TEAMS OF ARM'S BRAIN RIGHT NOW.

31:36 THEY WANT TO GET THE RECOGNITION FOR WHAT THEY'RE

31:37 DOING NAI. IF THE EXPECTATIONS ARE SET TOO

31:42 HIGH THE RISK IS YOU SET YOURSELF UP FOR A FALL IF THERE

31:47 IS DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE QUARTERS TO,.

31:51 I'VE SPOKEN TO OTHER COMPANIES WHO EXPRESSED THIS SENTIMENT

31:53 THAT THEY WANT TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR WHAT THEY ARE DOING.

31:57 THEY DO NOT WANTED TO BE OVERCOOKED.

32:02 NVIDIA IS TRADING 35 TIMES ITS FORWARD EARNINGS.

32:05 THAT IS NOT WILDLY OUTSIDE THE REALM OF WHAT SOME OF ITS PEERS

32:06 ARE DOING. THE CASE WITH ARM'S IT STARTS

32:10 TO GET OUT OF THAT SPACE. MAYBE THEY CAN DELIVER.

32:15 THAT IS NOT FOR ME TO PREDICT. LISA: CAN WE SAY TESLA IS OUT AS

32:23 THESE SHARES SURGE AND TESLA IS DOWN 20%? ALEX: IN TERMS OF AI?

32:28 IT IS FASCINATING. ELON MUSK IS TRYING TO MAKE THE

32:31 CASE THEY ARE NAI COMPANY. I FOLLOWED THIS SELF-DRIVING

32:35 SPACE. YOU NEVER HEARD ABOUT TESLA

32:40 BEING UP THERE AT THE TOP TIER OF SELF-DRIVING TECHNOLOGIES.

32:43 YOU THINK ABOUT WAYMO. YOU THINK ABOUT THE GM CRUISE

32:47 UNIT. AURORA. THOSE GUYS THE TOP TIER.

32:52 TESLA NOT THOUGHT OF IN THE SAME CATEGORY.

32:55 MAYBE THE MARKET IS WAKING UP TO THAT.

32:59 SELF-DRIVING IS NOT FULL SELF-DRIVING.

33:03 WHAT THEY BRAND AS FULL SELF-DRIVING DOES NOT LET YOU

33:04 GO ON THE ROADS WITH YOUR HANDS OFF THE STEERING WHEEL.

33:07 IT SEEMS LIKE THAT MESSAGE MIGHT BE TRICKLING THROUGH IT

33:11 ONLY SCALES WITHIN TESLA. LISA: THE REASON I ASK IS BECAUSE

33:16 WHEN WE ZOOM OUT THERE IS A QUESTION OF WHEN THE AI BOOM

33:19 WILL TRICKLE OUT TO OTHER COMPANIES THAT WILL USE IT TO

33:21 CREATE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

33:24 INVESTORS ARE LOOKING AT. CAN WE SEE THE SAME KIND OF

33:29 BOOST EQUITY VALUATIONS, THE SAME KIND OF BOOSTER EARNINGS

33:31 FOR OTHER COMPANIES OUTSIDE THE TRADITIONAL TEXT FEAR -- THE

33:38 TRADITIONAL TECH SPHERE? ARE PEOPLE SNIFFING THAT OUT

33:41 ALREADY OR IS THAT A YET TO BE DISCOVERED SPACE? ALEX:

33:45 I DO NOT KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION.

33:48 THERE COMPANIES THAT MIGHT BE WELL-POSITIONED.

33:53 IF YOU THINK ABOUT SOME OF THESE BIG CONSULTANCY FIRMS,

33:56 THEY LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE

34:04 LIKES OF ACCENTURE AND THOSE GUYS -- THEY LIKE TO TALK ABOUT

34:06 THE POTENTIAL OF AI ON TWO FRANCE. -- ON TWO FRONTS.

34:13 YOU COULD DO SOME OF THE WORK THEY HAVE CONSULTANTS DOING AND

34:21 ALSO THEY COULD BRING THOSE CAPABILITIES INTO

34:29 -- THEIR CLIENTS FIRMS. DOES THAT MEAN THEY ARE NAI PLAY?

34:36 -- DOES THAT MEAN THEY ARE AN AI PLAY? I DO NOT THINK SO.

34:40 IT IS STILL SO EARLY IN THE EVOLUTION.

34:46 INCREASINGLY YOU WILL GET HYPER SPECIALIZED APPLICATIONS OF AI

34:49 AND THAT IS WHERE THE OPPORTUNITIES WILL EXPLODE.

34:52 DO NOT KNOW WHO THOSE COMPANIES ARE YET. JONATHAN:

34:55 ALEX WEBB OF BLOOMBERG OUT OF LONDON.

34:58 A SNEAK PEEK OF THE PREMARKET. ARM -2.65%.

35:02 WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT $95 BILLION BILL GOING THROUGH

35:07 THE SENATE. SENATOR'S UP EARLY TO PASS A

35:11 $95 BILLION A BILL FOR UKRAINE COME ISRAEL, AND TAIWAN.

35:16 THIS IS THE SENATE. YOU SET ALL MORNING THIS WILL

35:19 NOT GET THROUGH THE HOUSE. ANNMARIE: MAJOR HURDLES.

35:25 YOU SEE CHUCK SCHUMER TALKING TO A VERY EARLY MORNING GROUP

35:26 OF SENATORS. IT CAME IN 70-29. A NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS WERE IN

35:35 FAVOR OF THIS, BUCKING THE TRENDS WE'VE SEEN FROM OTHER

35:37 REPUBLICANS FOLLOWING DONALD TRUMP'S LEAD.

35:40 YOU HAVE TO THINK BEFORE THE SENATORS EVEN WOKE UP AND VOTED

35:44 ON THIS FINAL PASSAGE, THEY WERE MET WITH A STATEMENT FROM

35:47 SPEAKER JOHNSON SAYING THE HOUSE WILL GO ITS OWN WAY.

35:50 JONATHAN: TO UNDERTAKE THAT LIVE SHOT

35:52 AGAIN? WHAT YOU NOTICE ABOUT CHUCK

35:54 SCHUMER. SUIT AND TIE, READY TO GO.

35:58 ANNMARIE: I HAVE AN UPDATE ON WHAT THEY

35:59 ARE WEARING. STEVE DENNIS TOLD ME SENATOR

36:03 BRITT APPEARED TO BE HEADING TO THE GYM NEXT.

36:07 TED CRUZ WEARING A LONGHORN SWEATSHIRT. LISA:

36:10 I THINK IT IS GREAT THEY WILL GO WORK OUT.

36:12 BE HEALTHY AND LIVE LONG. JONATHAN:

36:15 HERE IS YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF. DANI:

36:19 PRESIDENT BIDEN IS FORMING A TASK FORCE TO ADDRESS THE

36:23 MISHANDLING OF CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS DURING PRESIDENTIAL

36:25 TRANSITIONS. THE SPECIAL COUNSEL REPORT

36:27 FOUND BIDEN KEPT DOCUMENTS IN HIS POSSESSION AFTER HE WAS

36:29 VICE PRESIDENT. WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS CALLED IT

36:34 A SYSTEMATIC ISSUE AFFECTING BOTH PARTIES.

36:37 THE TASK FORCE WILL PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS BEFORE THE NEXT

36:41 PRESIDENTIAL TRANSITION. THE INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY

36:43 EXPECTS GLOBAL OIL MARKETS TO REMAIN COMFORTABLE.

36:46 SUPPLY WILL SATISFY DEMAND AND KEEP PRICES IN CHECK.

36:52 >> IN THE ABSENCE OF MAJOR GEOPOLITICAL TURMOIL FOR MAJOR

36:59 EXTREME EVENTS, WE WOULD EXPECT A COMFORTABLE OIL MARKET AND

37:04 COMFORTABLE AIR PRICE EVOLUTION THROUGHOUT 2024. DANI:

37:11 IEA SAYS WORLD CONSUMPTION WILL INCREASE UP TO 1.3 MILLION

37:15 BARRELS A DAY, A SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKER PACE THAN LAST YEAR.

37:20 TIGER WOODS IS LAUNCHING A NEW BRAND AFTER ENDING HIS

37:21 LONG-TERM DEAL WITH NIKE. HE SIGNED A DEAL WITH

37:23 TAILOR-MADE GOLF. THEY WILL CREATE AN APPAREL

37:26 LINE CALLED SUNDAY RENT. FINANCE -- SUNDAY RED.

37:32 FINANCIAL TERMS OF NOT BEEN DISCLOSED.

37:34 THAT IS YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF. JONATHAN:

37:39 UP NEXT, INFLATION DATA ON DECK. >> AT SOME POINT IT WILL BE

37:43 APPROPRIATE FOR US TO LOWER THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE.

37:46 DO NOT SEE THAT IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE THAT I DID NOT

37:48 WANT TO PREJUDGE WHAT OUR DECISIONS MIGHT BE. JONATHAN:

37:53 THAT INFLATION DATA TWO HOURS AWAY. IN THE S&P 500, -.4%.

37:59 IN THE BOND MARKET YIELDS LOWER. 4.1657.

38:05 LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY, THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

38:19 JONATHAN: STOCKS SLIGHTLY DOWN YESTERDAY.

38:23 THIS MORNING THE SAME GAME. DOWN ABOUT .4% ON THE S&P.

38:31 10 YEAR 4.1637. EURO NOT DOING MUCH. 1.0 774.

38:37 CRUDE THE SMALLEST OF BOUNCES. $77.42 ON WTI.

38:43 INFLATION DATA ON DECK.

38:47 >> THE PROGRESS WE'RE MAKING ON INFLATION IS VERY POSITIVE.

38:52 AS LONG AS WE HAVE CONTINUED PROGRESS AT THE CURRENT POLICY

38:54 RATE, I THINK AT SOME POINT IT WILL BE APPROPRIATE FOR US TO

38:57 LOWER THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE. I DO NOT SEE THAT IN THE

39:01 IMMEDIATE FUTURE AND I DO NOT WANT TO PREJUDGE WHAT OUR

39:05 DECISIONS MIGHT BE GOING FORWARD THIS YEAR. JONATHAN:

39:12 FIT OFFICIALS REITERATING IT IS TOO SOON TO CHANGE POLICY WITH

39:16 JANUARY CPI DATA DROPPING AND DOES GO HOURS.

39:19 THE MEDIAN ESTIMATE CALLING FOR THE HEADLINE NUMBER TO DROP

39:22 BELOW 3% FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THREE YEARS.

39:25 JENNIFER LEE WRITING "POLICY AND MARKETS WILL NEED TO WAIT

39:28 THROUGH MIXED MESSAGES, BUT WILL LIKELY CONCLUDE OR

39:32 EVIDENCE WILL BE REQUIRED FOR THE FED TO FEEL COMFORTABLE

39:36 WITH THE PLAN TO START EASING MIDYEAR."

39:39 JENNIFER LEE JOINS US WITH MORE. LET'S START WITH THE EVIDENCE

39:43 THESE DISINFLATIONARY TRENDS ARE BROADENING OUT.

39:46 HOW MUCH DO YOU SEE? JENNIFER: WE ARE SEEING SOME EVIDENCE OF

39:52 THIS BROADENING OUT BUT IT IS NOT AS BROUGHT WITH WHAT THE

39:55 FED WANTS TO SEE. THIS IS WHERE THE STICKY

40:01 INFLATION STORY IS STILL PLAYING OUT VERY BROADLY.

40:04 THIS IS A STORY AROUND THE WORLD AS WELL, WHICH IS WHY

40:08 WERE NOT SEEING CENTRAL BANKS COMING MORE BROADLY QUARTER.

40:16 I WANT TO SEE MORE EVIDENCE OF THAT PLAYING OUT AND BEING MORE

40:20 COMFORTABLE BEFORE THEY CAN START FEELING BETTER AND MORE

40:24 CONFIDENT ABOUT CUTTING RATES. LISA:

40:30 WHEN YOU ZOOM OUT THERE IS AN EXISTENTIAL QUESTION, WILL THE

40:31 FED HAVE THE ABILITY TO KILL THE INFLATION BEAST?

40:37 WILL THEY END UP STAYING ON HOLD , BUT FACING A RESEARCHING

40:40 INFLATION LATER THIS YEAR OR NEXT YEAR THAT CAUSES THEM TO

40:41 HIKE RATES AGAIN? WE HEARD FROM CITIGROUP'S JASON

40:46 WILLIAMS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS WHERE HE WROTE THE

40:49 MARKET SHOULD PRICING SOME RISK OF FUTURE HIKES.

40:54 THIS CYCLE COULD BE MORE AKIN TO THE 1998 EASING CYCLE WHICH

40:57 WAS SHORT-LIVED AND RED TO MORGUE -- AND LED TO MORE RATE

40:58 HIKES. DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT? JENNIFER:

41:04 THAT WOULD BE A BIG PROBLEM IF THEY CUT A COUPLE TIMES.

41:08 THIS IS WHERE YOU CAN SEE A BIG CREDIBILITY ISSUE PLAYING OUT

41:09 AT THAT POINT.

41:15 THIS IS WHAT THE FED WANTS TO AVOID AND WHY THEY ARE SO

41:17 HESITANT TO CUT RATES TOO EARLY. WE HAVE THE MARKET PRICING IN

41:24 AT ONE POINT ALMOST 100% CHANCE OF RATE CUT IN MARCH.

41:27 THANKFULLY CHAIR POWELL CAME OUT LAST WEEK OR TWO WEEKS AGO

41:32 AND DISMISSED THAT IDEA ALMOST COMPLETELY.

41:36 THEY ARE JUST TRYING TO TELL EVERYONE TO BE PATIENT, CHILL

41:41 OUT, SIT BACK, AND WATCH THE DATA AND MAKE SURE WE ARE

41:42 CONFIDENT. ALL OF THOSE KEYWORDS THEY KEEP

41:45 THROWING OUT. CONFIDENCE AND PATIENCE

41:50 INFLATION IS HEADED TOWARDS THE 2% TARGET ON A SUSTAINED ASIS.

41:54 THIS IS WHAT THEY WANT TO SEE. I DO NOT THINK A FEW NUMBERS

41:57 WILL CUT IT. LISA:

42:04 HOW MUCH ARE YOU GETTING THE SENSE THAT SPECIFIC COMPONENTS

42:07 ARE COMING DOWN WHEN IT COMES TO INFLATION ENOUGH TO BE

42:08 SUSTAINABLE? DO YOU BELIEVE THIS IS A NEW

42:13 INFLATIONARY CYCLE THAT MIGHT BE DECEIVING IN THE IDEA IT

42:17 TRULY HAS BEEN FILLED? -- HAS BEEN KILLED?

42:24 JENNIFER: REMEMBER BACK IN THE OLD DAYS

42:28 WHEN WE JUST LOOKED AT HEADLINE INFLATION AND NOW WE HAVE TO

42:30 LOOK AT ALL OF THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT

42:32 EVERYTHING SHOULD BE COMING DOWN TO 2%.

42:37 MOSTLY EVERYTHING HAS TO BE HEADED IN THAT DIRECTION.

42:39 NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE THE SUPER COURT, GOODS AND

42:42 SERVICES. GOODS INFLATION IS COMING DOWN

42:45 QUITE QUICKLY. SERVICES IS WHERE THINGS ARE

42:48 STILL STICKY. YOU STILL THE STRONG U.S.

42:54 CONSUMER WILLING TO SHELL OUT FOR TRAVEL, FOR CONCERTS, FOR

42:56 GAMBLING. THERE IS STILL A LOT OF STRONG

43:03 DEMAND FOR SERVICES AND THAT IS KEEPING SERVICES CPI STICKY AND

43:08 THAT IS WHY THE FED WILL BE PATIENT UNTIL THEY ARE

43:10 CONFIDENT THINGS ARE HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. JONATHAN:

43:15 THE GAMBLING NUMBERS ARE NOT. YOU SENSE THIS AND THE NEWS

43:18 CONFERENCE WITH CHAIRMAN POWELL. HE TOLD US WHERE THE SURVEY WAS.

43:25 THE DATA DOES NEED TO GET BETTER.

43:27 ULTIMATELY WE ARE SAYING WE NEED TO SEE MORE OF THE SAME

43:28 THING. THIS CHAIRMAN, AND MAYBE SOME

43:35 PEOPLE ON THE COMMITTEE AS WELL, ARE JUST NOT COMFORTABLE

43:38 THEY HAVE SEEN ENOUGH YET, BECAUSE THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT

43:39 WHAT YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. THEY START REDUCING INTEREST

43:43 RATES AND THEY WERE PROBLEM DOWN THE ROAD AND THEY START

43:46 HIKING AGAIN. LISA: THE PROBLEM IS PEOPLE ARE STILL

43:50 GETTING HIRED, EARNING REAL WAGES, AND SPENDING.

43:54 WE WILL GET AIRBNB EARNINGS TODAY, WE WILL GET OTHERS.

43:58 THE SAME KIND OF TRAIN SEEMS TO BE PREVALENT EVERYWHERE.

44:01 HOW DO YOU GET CONFIDENCE YOU CAN KILL THE INFLATION BEAST

44:04 LOWERING RATES WHEN IT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE ALL THAT RESTRICTIVE?

44:07 WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE CREDIT TIGHTENING YOU WOULD EXPECT

44:11 GIVEN HOW MUCH THEY'VE RAISED RATES. JONATHAN:

44:15 CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE CONSUMER AS WELL? IT IS NOT JUST CPI.

44:19 IT IS RETAIL SALES. WE HAVE TALKED TO BUT CONSUMER

44:22 RUNNING ON FUMES. HOW STRONG IS THE CONSUMER NOW?

44:27 JENNIFER: THE CONSUMER IS STILL IN PRETTY

44:29 DECENT SHAPE. IT GOES BACK TO THE JOB MARKET.

44:34 EVEN THOUGH THE JOB MARKET HAS COOLED, WE ARE NOT SEEING JOB

44:37 GAINS OF THE 500,000 FRIDAY. AS LONG AS THERE IS STILL

44:43 DECENT DEMAND FOR JOBS OR WORKERS COME EVERYONE IS MAKING

44:44 A DECENT WAGE. THAT IS ENOUGH TO KEEP THE

44:49 CONSUMER GOING. THEY DO NOT HAVE TO SPEND IT

44:53 ALL, THEY CAN PUT SOME ASIDE FOR A RAINY DAY. THAT IS OK.

44:59 WHATEVER YOU'RE MAKING, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BLOW IT ALL RIGHT

45:00 AWAY. THAT KEEPS THE FUNDAMENTAL SUPPORT BELOW THE U.S.

45:05 ECONOMY GOING. AS LONG AS WE CONTINUE TO RISE,

45:10 JOB DEMAND IS STILL DECENT, THAT WILL KEEP THE CONSUMER

45:15 MOVING FORWARD. LISA:

45:17 I AM STRUCK BY THE POLARIZATION OF THE PEOPLE WE SPEAK TO AND

45:18 THE NEW PARADIGM. WILL IT BE RE-INFLATIONARY

45:24 PARADIGM OR WILL IT BE ONE WHERE WE ARE DECEIVED BY THE

45:25 STRENGTHEN THE ECONOMY? EARLY THIS MORNING WE GOT SMALL

45:30 BUSINESS OPTIMISM DATA AND IT ACTUALLY FELL THE MOST SINCE

45:33 THE END OF 2022. HERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE

45:38 RESURGENT DEMAND, THIS INCREDIBLE STRENGTH.

45:41 WHAT IS THE RISK FROM YOUR VANTAGE POINT WE ARE WORRIED

45:44 ABOUT THE WRONG THING AND IT IS THE DECELERATION THAT IS MORE

45:45 PRESENT? JENNIFER: I AM QUITE WORRIED.

45:51 WHENEVER I SEE NUMBERS CONTINUING TO BE EXPECTATIONS

45:55 -- LOOK AT THE LAST COUPLE OF REPORTS.

46:03 OF COURSE I'M ALWAYS THINKING WHAT ARE WE MISSING, WHAT ARE

46:05 THE MARKET MISSING. IT ALL GOES BACK DOWN TO THE

46:08 LABOR MARKET. AT SOME POINT OVER 500 BASIS

46:13 POINTS OF RATE HIKES IS STARTING TO HAVE AN IMPACT AND

46:16 NOT HAVING AS MUCH OF AN IMPACT AS ONE WOULD HAVE IMAGINED

46:19 DURING NORMAL TIMES. THESE ARE NOT NORMAL TIMES.

46:25 THIS IS WHY WE ARE STEPPING FOR OUR FED RATE CUT CALL, NOT

46:28 UNTIL THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.

46:30 I DO NOT BELIEVE WE ARE EVER IN THAT MARCH CAMP.

46:33 I THINK JUNE AND JULY IS THE MOST LIKELY SCENARIO FOR THE

46:37 RATE CUTS TO START HAPPENING. JONATHAN: IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF

46:41 ECONOMISTS ON WALL STREET COALESCING AROUND THE SAME

46:44 MONTH. IT IS GOOD TO HEAR FROM YOU.

46:48 JENNIFER LEE OF BMO ON THE CPI DATA THAT COMES OUT AND ABOUT

46:50 ONE HOUR AND 36 MINUTES. CPI DATA, 2.9% IS WHAT WE ARE

46:56 LOOKING FOR, DOWN FROM 3.4%.

47:02 HEADLINE FOR CORE 3.7 DOWN FROM 3.9.

47:06 MONTH OVER MONTH FIGURE, .2% IS THE ESTIMATE IN OUR SURVEY.

47:12 IF YOU TALK ABOUT THE LABOR MARKET AND PRICE PRESSURE,

47:14 ANDREW HOLLENHORST HAS SOMETHING TO SAY.

47:19 "WE CONTINUE TO SEE A STRONGER UNDERLYING TREND OF INFLATION

47:23 SUCH AS FACTORS AS WAGE INFLATION CONTINUING TO MOVE

47:26 SIDEWAYS AT 4.5%." THIS IS WHAT JENNIFER IS

47:29 TALKING ABOUT. LISA: IT COMES DOWN TO THE LABOR

47:33 MARKET AND THE LABOR MARKET IS SURPRISING TO THE UPSIDE,

47:38 WHETHER ON NUMBERS WERE WAGE GROWTH, OR WHETHER IT IS

47:40 SURPRISING TO THE DOWNSIDE IN JOBLESS CLAIMS. HERE IS THE

47:43 DISSIDENTS. YESTERDAY EVERYONE WAS TALKING

47:50 ABOUT INFLATION RISK IN THE NEW YORK FED PUTS OUT THREE-YEAR

47:51 INFLATION EXPECTATIONS FROM CONSUMERS.

47:54 IT FALLS TO THE LOWEST SINCE 2013. EVERYONE PILES INTO BONDS.

47:59 THE RUSSELL 2000 RALLIES. EVERYONE IS WAITING TO COALESCE

48:03 AROUND THAT. JONATHAN: CHRIS VERRONE.

48:09 WE WILL SEE THE EQUITY MARKET BROUGHT AMOUNT, TAKE A LOOK AT

48:11 CHINA. WHEN YOU SEE THAT, SENTIMENT IS

48:13 HIGH. LISA: I WONDER IF THAT IS THE BIAS

48:18 RIGHT NOW? JONATHAN: IN THE NEXT HOUR, A STACKED

48:22 LINEUP. THAT IS COMING UP IN THE SECOND

48:27 HOUR OF "BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE."

48:32 EQUITY FUTURES -.4% ON THE S&P 500. IN THE BOND MARKET, YIELDS

48:36 4.1637. I LOOKED AT THE LAST TIME WE

48:41 GOT A CPI PRINT ON JANUARY 11. THE TWO YEAR CLOSED AT 4.24.

48:48 THE 10 YEAR CLOSED AT 3.96. YIELDS HAVE SHIFTED HIGHER AND

48:52 THIS EQUITY MARKET IS HIGHER OVER THE SAME PERIOD. LISA:

48:56 IS POSITIVE FOR THE RIGHT REASON.

48:59 YIELDS HAVE BEEN HIRED BECAUSE THE GROWTH IS SO GOOD.

49:01 WE CAN KEEP GOING. JONATHAN: TO SOUND FED UP WITH THIS

49:05 CONVERSATION ALREADY. LISA: IT IS NOT THAT I'M FED UP.

49:09 WE WILL NOT GET AN ANSWER. JONATHAN:

49:14 HOWDY PLAN TO GET THROUGH 2024 WHEN IT IS THE MIDDLE OF

49:18 FEBRUARY AND YOU'RE ALREADY SICK OF POLITICS, SICK OF

49:21 MONETARY POLICY. LISA:

49:42 IT DOES SEEMS THAT IF IT IS STEADY AS SHE GOES THE FED WILL

49:45 CUT RATES THIS YEAR. WE SHOULD BE IN A POSITION

49:50 WHERE THEY WILL BE CONFIDENT TO CUT.

49:56 YOU WILL PROBABLY SEE A CUTTING CYCLE IN MAY.

50:00 WE WILL SEE AN ECONOMY DOING WELL BECAUSE OF THE EASY OF

50:03 FINANCIAL CONDITIONS. INFLATION IS COMING DOWN AND

50:10 THAT IS THE PERFECT PROGRESS SCENARIO.

50:18 THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE WITH JONATHAN FARRELL, LISA

50:21 ABRAMOWITZ AND ANN MARIE HERDER AND.

50:32 JONATHAN: THERE IS A NEW BAR FOR SOME FED

50:37 OFFICIALS.

50:44 WHAT THEY WANT TO SEE IS MORE DATA AND BROADENING OUT OF THE

50:46 DISINFLATION STORY. LISA:

50:55 THERE IS THIS IDEA THAT IF YOU SEE FACTORS PLAY INTO WHY WE

50:58 ARE SEEING DISINFLATION AND CODES THEY WILL FEEL MORE

50:59 COMFORTABLE.

51:08 WHETHER THEY ARE JUST TRYING TO PLACATE SOMETHING OR MOVES THE

51:14 NEEDLE, IF WE GET THIS DATA AND SEES SHELTER AND OTHER CAUSES

51:17 CONTRIBUTING MORE TO DISINFLATION. JONATHAN:

51:22 THE DATA HAS GIVEN US PAUSE.

51:29 I WAS HOPING WHEN THE ISM PRICES WOULD CLICK HIGHER. LISA:

51:36 DISINFLATION HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY PRODUCTS NOT BY PEOPLE GOING

51:44 TO BARS AND RESTAURANTS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE GETTING HIGHER WAGES.

51:52 UNTIL YOU SEE THAT COMING IN MATERIALLY, IS THIS SOMETHING

51:58 THAT IS A NEW PARADIGM FOR THE PEOPLE ARE GETTING PAID MORE

52:01 AND SPENDING MORE? JONATHAN:

52:08 I WANTED TURNED TO THE LATEST A WASHINGTON DC, WHEN WE TALK

52:13 ABOUT PRICE PRESSURE WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT COSBY A SCOPE POLICY.

52:20 IT IS ANOTHER 95 BILLION BILL FOR FOREIGN AID. ANNMARIE:

52:25 THIS IS GOING TO UKRAINE, ISRAEL AND TAIWAN BUT BEFORE

52:31 THEY EVEN TOOK THAT PHOTO THERE WAS A FILIBUSTER ALL NIGHT.

52:39 WE HEARD FROM SPEAKER JOHNSON WHO THREW COLD WATER ON THIS

52:41 IDEA IS THAT THE HOUSE IS GOING TO GO ITS OWN WAY.

52:49 WHAT YOU SEE NOW AND WHAT WE DISCUSSED WITH AMBASSADOR HALEY

52:54 IS THIS WHERE WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WITH DEFENSE

52:59 HAWKS WHO WON TO SEND THESE WEAPONS TO UKRAINE AND THE

53:02 ISOLATIONIST APPROACH. JONATHAN: WE ARE JUST GOING THROUGH THE

53:13 OUTLOOK, A LITTLE BETTER THAN ANTICIPATED. LISA:

53:17 PEOPLE ARE STILL BUYING COKE.

53:26 THE ESTIMATE WAS 5.9 AND IT'S A LITTLE BETTER THAN THAT.

53:39 WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE MIX, NUTRITION, JUICE, DAIRY

53:47 WERE UP 6% WHILE WATER, COFFEE, TEA. JONATHAN:

53:58 YOU ALLUDED TO THIS. LISA: IS THIS THE O'S A?

54:07 PEOPLE CARE ABOUT THEIR NUTRITION. JONATHAN:

54:14 THE STOCK IS BARELY MOVING, POSITIVE 5.2%.

54:21 EQUITY FUTURES LOOK LIKE THIS, NEGATIVE HERE ON THE S&P BY .5%.

54:32 EURODOLLAR UP .07.

54:41 COMING UP WE HAVE JIM SALTER, DAVID BALLIN . U.S.

54:50 STOCKS ARE TOWARDS ALL-TIME HIGHS.

54:58 APOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT POSTED A RECORD.

55:01 JIM, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

55:08 THANK YOU FOR COMING ON, WELL RECEIVED BY THIS MARKET.

55:17 JIM: WE HAVE A BUSINESS AND AN

55:23 INDUSTRY THAT GETS BETTER EVERY DAY AS THERE ARE MORE RETIREES

55:30 LOOKING TOWARDS RETIREMENT AND

55:38 DO YOU HAVE AN OF ALL THE -- EVOLVING BANKING SYSTEM.

55:44 AS AN INDUSTRY, IT'S A SECULAR CHANGE.

55:48 WE HAD A BUSINESS BUT HIT ON ALL CYLINDERS AND ALL PARTS OF

56:00 OUR BUSINESS, GREAT INVESTOR PERFORMANCE, AND WE DID SO ON A

56:01 RISK-ADJUSTED BASIS. JONATHAN:

56:08 THERE IS A SENTIMENT OUT THERE, APOLLO IS KILLING IT AND

56:11 THE BANKS ARE STRUGGLING. THEIR LOSS IS YOUR WHEN IS THAT

56:14 HOW IT WORKS? JIM:

56:23 IT'S A BRUTALLY COMPETITIVE BUSINESS WEATHER ON THE BANKING

56:24 OR ASSET MANAGEMENT SIDE.

56:30 THE COMPETITION FOR MARKET SHARE IS BRUTALLY COMPETITIVE

56:33 BUT IT IS A GREAT NARRATIVE.

56:40 THERE IS A MUCH MORE SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP THAT EXISTS AND WE

56:45 ARE A COUNTERPARTY OF THE U.S. INSTITUTIONS.

56:54 IT'S NOT ON ANY ONE TRANSACTION, WHETHER COASTS OF

56:58 THE BROADLY SYNDICATED MARKETER MORE BROADLY.

56:59 THESE ARE COMPETITIVE WITHIN OUR INDUSTRY AND THE BANKS AND

57:01 THAT WILL NEVER CHANGE.

57:08 THE FINANCING THAT TAKES PLACE, COUNTERPARTY FINANCING FROM THE

57:10 LARGE INSTITUTIONS IS CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS AND WE PROVIDE

57:14 THEM OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS EQUITY AND DEBT BUSINESSES.

57:20 LISA: IN HIGH SCHOOL WHEN YOU HAVE

57:25 TWO FRIENDS THAT ALWAYS TALK ABOUT EACH OTHER BEHIND THEIR

57:29 BACKS BUT THEY ARE POLITE BECAUSE THEY OPERATE IN THE

57:31 SAME CIRCLE. MORGAN STANLEY IS BOLSTERING

57:39 ITS PRIVATE EQUITY PORTFOLIO AND GOLDMAN SACHS WANTS TO

57:43 DOUBLE THE SIZE OF ITS CREDIT BUSINESS. JIM:

57:47 WE ARE IN A COMPETITIVE

57:53 INDUSTRY WITH THEM SMARTEST MINDS BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY

57:56 IT'S ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS MODEL AND HOW YOU RUN YOUR BUSINESS.

58:05 THERE IS NO DOUBT THERE WILL BE FIRMS THAT WILL START CREDIT

58:08 BUSINESSES BUT LET'S TAKE A STEP BACK.

58:17 PRIVATE CREDIT IS BROADER THAN JUST SPONSORED BY OUT.

58:20 IT IS A GREAT HEADLINE PRODUCT

58:28 BUT THAT IS ONE TRILLION MARKET WHERE PRIVATE CREDIT IS

58:30 40 TRILLION. WITH AIRCRAFT FINANCE, SOLAR

58:39 FINANCE, INVENTORY FINANCE THAT IS WHERE WE HAVE A COMPETITIVE

58:44 TOOL PACKS -- BOX.

58:51 WE HAVE BROUGHT OUR COST OF CAPITAL DOWN.

59:02 IN YOU ARE IN THE MANAGEMENT OR DISTRESS BUSINESS IN THIS

59:06 HIGHER RATE ENVIRONMENT PEOPLE LIKE TO BUY ANNUITIES.

59:12 THAT BRINGS SIN A LOT OF LONG-DURATION, LOWER COST

59:19 CAPITAL.

59:19 LISA: HOW MUCH HAS THE MONEY THAT

59:28 YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT BEEN THE REASON WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE

59:30 CREDIT CYCLE PEOPLE WERE EXPECTING? JIM:

59:39 I THINK WHAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW, EQUITY MARKETS WERE UP 20%

59:44 AND AT THE END OF THE YEAR YOU HAD DEFAULTS APPROACHING 5%.

59:48 THAT'S A PRETTY UNIQUE CHARACTERISTIC.

59:53 THE STRENGTH OF THIS ECONOMY HAS BEFUDDLED ECONOMIST AND ALL

01:00:00 OF YOUR GUEST IT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TOP LOTS EVEN WITH THE

01:00:04 FOLKS THAT HAVE THE INFORMATION HAVE MISSED THIS.

01:00:13 I THINK YOU ARE SEEING SIGNS OF A HARDENING OF ECONOMIC

01:00:15 CONDITIONS COMING UP. I THINK THE FED HAS MADE THE

01:00:20 RIGHT CHOICE.

01:00:29 THEY PUT THEMSELVES IN AN INTERESTING POSITION WHERE THEY

01:00:30 CAN COMMUNICATE VOLATILITY WITH

01:00:39 A LOT OF WORK LEFT IN THE GUN. IT'S A MUCH MORE RESILIENT

01:00:41 ECONOMY. THE U.S. ECONOMY IS THE BULWARK OF THE

01:00:45 WESTERN WORLD. JONATHAN:

01:00:47 THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS THE ABILITY TO RESPOND TO NEGATIVE

01:00:54 SHOCKS. OF THE ISSUANCE WE HAVE SEEN SO

01:00:59 FAR, THIS BOOM IS SUPPLY AND FLOOD OF DEMAND IS THAT BECAUSE

01:01:05 THE ECONOMY IS STRONG OR ARE WE ANTICIPATING LOWER RATES? JIM:

01:01:10 THE U.S. CONSUMER HAS PREPARED THEMSELVES FOR A HIGHER RATE

01:01:12 ENVIRONMENT. CORPORATE BALANCE SHEETS ARE

01:01:18 PREPARED WELL AND WHEN THEY SEE FINANCING OPPORTUNITIES DON'T

01:01:22 WAIT AROUND FOR PERFECTION AND THAT HAS BEEN A GOOD LESSON.

01:01:30 THERE HAS BEEN A THOUGHTFUL WHEN PEOPLE SEE WHAT IS GOING

01:01:35 ON THAT THERE HAS BEEN A RUSH AND RISK ON TRADE.

01:01:41 THE MARKET HAS BEEN PRICED TO PERFECTION AND EVERY ASSET

01:01:47 CLASS WHICH MEANS IT'S A GOOD TIME TO ISSUE.

01:01:54 FOR US, WE UNDERPERFORM IN PERIODS LIKE THIS.

01:01:57 WE ARE LOW LEVERED. WE ARE IN A POSITION WHERE IF

01:02:00 THERE ARE POCKETS OF VOLATILITY WE ARE WELL-POSITIONED.

01:02:02 JONATHAN: YOU WANT TO BE THE LIQUIDITY

01:02:06 PROVIDER. JIM:

01:02:13 THE STORY THAT HAS NOT BEEN SPENT ON IS THE ISSUE OF MARKET

01:02:23 STRUCTURE THE LACK OF THE ABILITIES IN THE IPO MARKET IS

01:02:25 FUNDAMENTALLY CHALLENGED.

01:02:32 THIS MARKET STRUCTURE ISSUE HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR SEVERAL YEARS

01:02:39 AND NOW MORE THAN PASSIVE IN SCALE WILL HAVE PROFOUND

01:02:43 EXPECTATIONS ON HOW PEOPLE RAISE CAPITAL. JONATHAN:

01:02:51 YOU MENTIONED CREDIT STRESS, I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THAT.

01:02:53 ARE YOU SEEING POCKETS OF STRESS? WHAT ARE YOU SEEING?

01:02:59 JIM:

01:03:05 IN A VERY BROAD ECONOMY WITH MASSIVE FUNDAMENTAL STRENGTH

01:03:12 YOU ARE SEEING SITUATIONS WHERE COMPANIES, POOR BUSINESS PLAN

01:03:15 OR WAY TOO MUCH THAT WHO HAVE NOT RECOVERED FROM COVID.

01:03:19 YOU SEE THAT MORE IN THE CORPORATE WORLD.

01:03:26 AS A CONSUMER THE AVERAGE MORTGAGE IS 3.8.

01:03:27 WE ARE NOT SEEING THE SAME PAIN AS THEY HAVE IN THE U.K.

01:03:31 IN GERMANY.

01:03:34 THERE HAS BEEN PRIVATE EQUITY ACTIVITY OVER THE PAST 5-7

01:03:48 YEARS.

01:03:49 THERE ARE CHALLENGES OUT THERE. JONATHAN:

01:04:00 JIM ZELTER WITH THIS FOR THE NEXT 30, 45 MINUTES.

01:04:03 HERE IS YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF. DANI:

01:04:11 RESIDENCE ARE URGED TO STAY HOME, THEY COULD RECEIVE EIGHT

01:04:13 INCHES OF SNOW.

01:04:21 7.3 INCHES WOULD BE THE MOST SENSE JANUARY 2022.

01:04:28 AREAS OF NEW JERSEY, PENNSYLVANIA COULD SEE AS MUCH

01:04:29 IS 12 INCHES.

01:04:39 CARL ICAHN DISCLOSED A 9.91 STAKE BEHIND BLACKROCK AND

01:04:41 VANGUARD.

01:04:48 THE STOCK DROPPED 30%. ICAHN SAID THAT HE HAS HAD

01:04:54 TALKS WITH MANAGEMENT ABOUT A BOARD SEAT.

01:05:02 SHARES OF MANCHESTER UNITED.

01:05:08 RADCLIFFE SAID HE WOULD PURCHASE THE STAKE ALLOWING

01:05:11 INVESTORS TO SWAP THEIR HOLDINGS FOR $33 A SHARE WHICH

01:05:14 IS WELL ABOVE MARKET PRICE. JONATHAN:

01:05:21 UP NEXT, INVESTORS ARE LOOKING AHEAD TO CPI.

01:05:26 >> I THINK THAT GROWTH NEWS WILL CONTINUE TO BE GOOD.

01:05:33 WE WILL KEEP THE PROSPECT OF RATE CUTS OUT THERE. JONATHAN:

01:05:50 JONATHAN: INFLATION DATA COMING UP IN

01:05:55 JUST A MINUTE. WE ARE -.41% ON THE SMP.

01:06:10 10 YEAR AT 4.15 INVESTORS ARE LOOKING AHEAD AT

01:06:12 THE CPI.

01:06:15 >> I THINK GROWTH WILL CONTINUE TO BE GOOD.

01:06:21 WE ARE GOING TO KEEP THE PROSPECT OF RATE CUTS OUT THERE

01:06:25 AND I THINK WE DO GET 4.5 ON THE 10 YEAR.

01:06:31 THAT FITS A STORY OF BETTER ECONOMIC GROWTH AND PUSHING OUT

01:06:33 THOSE RATE CUTS. JONATHAN:

01:06:40 HERE IS THE LATEST, CPI DATA OUT AND JUST ABOUT AN HOUR.

01:06:46 THEY ARE HOPING THE HEADLINE NUMBER WILL DIP BELOW 3%.

01:06:54 SIZE OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AND RECOVERY ARE SPREADING FASTER

01:06:57 THAN ECONOMISTS BELIEVE POSSIBLE.

01:07:03 DAVID JOINS US FOR MORE.

01:07:10 IT IS SLOW AND GROW BECOMING THE GROW AND GROW? DAVID:

01:07:17 WE ARE SEEING NO SLOW DOWN. WE EXPECTED IT IS NOT.

01:07:24 THE CONSUMER HAS STAYED HEALTHY WITH INFLATION COMING DOWN WITH

01:07:28 REAL INCREASES IN WAGES STARTING IN NOVEMBER.

01:07:36 HEALTHY CONSUMER BALANCE SHEETS AND THE BIG STORY HAPPENING FOR

01:07:40 THE CONSUMER'S IMPORT PRICES ARE NEGATIVE.

01:07:45 WE ARE IMPORTING AT LESS COST FROM CHINA AND THAT IS ROLLING

01:07:46 THROUGH THE ECONOMY. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CONSUMER

01:07:51 CONTINUING TO BUY YOU SEE CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IN THE

01:07:57 MICHIGAN INDEX. ALL OF THIS IS GOING AGAINST

01:08:02 THE FACT THAT THE FED HAS KEPT

01:08:05 RATES HIGHER FOR LONGER AND THAT IS THE QUICK STORY.

01:08:10 THINGS ARE GOING BETTER THAN WE THOUGHT. JONATHAN:

01:08:14 CONSENSUS WAS BULLISH AND WE HAVE PUSHED OUT THOSE RATE

01:08:20 BECAUSE AND YET WE ARE STILL BULLISH.

01:08:24 HAVE YOU CHANGED YOUR MARKET CALL?

01:08:27 OUR MARKET CALL IS MORE BULLISH IN TERMS OF WHAT THE SNB COULD

01:08:28 DO FOR THE YEAR.

01:08:35 -- S&P COULD DO FOR THE YEAR.

01:08:42 I THINK WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS THE MARKET IS TELLING US ABOUT

01:08:43 WHAT THE ECONOMY IS LIKELY TO DO OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT

01:08:47 SIX MONTHS WHICH WILL TURN OUT AND EARNINGS.

01:08:51 WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE UP 5% BUT THEY COULD BE UP SIX, 7%

01:08:56 WHICH IS CONSIDERABLY MORE. IT SUPPORTS HIGHER RATES FOR

01:08:59 LONGER.

01:09:09 IS PAUL SAID BEAR BECOMING BOWL AND THEN BOWL?

01:09:17 AT WHAT POINT DOES IT LEAD TO A RESURGENCE IN INFLATION? DAVID:

01:09:22 THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT THAT IS LEAST

01:09:23 LIKELY TO OCCUR.

01:09:29 INFLATION IS GOING TO STAY MODERATED.

01:09:38 THE FACT THAT WE HAVE MATERIALLY INCREASING LABOR

01:09:39 COSTS IN THE ECONOMY HAS NORMALIZED AFTER COVID.

01:09:44 THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE INFLATION WILL BE A BIGGER

01:09:51 PROBLEM. LISA:

01:09:53 YOUR COLLEAGUE JASON WILLIAMS WROTE THE MARKET SHOULD PRICE

01:09:55 AND RISK OF FUTURE HIKES. THIS CYCLE COULD BE AKIN TO THE

01:10:03 EASING CYCLE THAT LED TO MORE RATE HIKES.

01:10:06 ARE YOU BAKING THAT INTO EXPECTATION?

01:10:11 IT IS A VERY CONFUSING MOMENT. DAVID:

01:10:15 I THINK THE FED IS SIGNALING TO US THEY WILL BE GRADED ABOUT

01:10:22 NOT LOWERING RATES QUICKLY BUT THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT

01:10:23 THERE'D BE ANY RECENT RAISE RATES.

01:10:39 THE BIGGER STORY IS GOING TO BE EQUITIES IN THE FACT THAT FEWER

01:10:46 THAN HALF OF THE EQUITY SECTORS HAD POSITIVE EARNINGS OF THIS

01:10:52 YEAR WE THINK IT WILL BE 90% OR MORE IN THE EQUITY STORY

01:10:55 INABILITY FOR EQUITIES TO GO HIGHER AS EARNINGS BECOME CLEAR

01:10:59 IS WHAT WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON AND THERE ARE FEWER VALUE PARTS OF

01:11:07 OUR MARKET, INDICATION THAT MARKETS ARE ANTICIPATING ALL WE

01:11:08 ARE TALKING ABOUT. JONATHAN:

01:11:16 DAVID BALIN WITH US THERE.

01:11:22 NVIDIA AND MICROSOFT, IS THE FAKE JUST GOING TO GET BIGGER?

01:11:32 -- IS THE BIG JUST GOING TO GET BIGGER?

01:11:39 JIM: THE IMPACT OF THE MAGNIFICENT

01:11:46 SEVEN IS BROADER -- HIGHER THAN THE BROAD INDEX IN THE MANNER

01:11:50 IN WHICH CAPITAL FORMATION HAS

01:11:56 HAPPENED HAS CHANGED BUT THE

01:12:02 MAGNIFICENT SEVEN HAD HAD A MAGNIFICENT PERFORMANCE.

01:12:09 IF YOU ARE NOT PICKING THOSE STOCKS HE WILL UNDERPERFORM.

01:12:10 LISA:

01:12:17 BIG COMPANIES DO BETTER WITH BETTER PERFORMING CREDIT AND

01:12:18 THAT IS A SWEET SPOT FOR YOU?

01:12:25 YOU ARE CONFIDENT THEY WILL SURVIVE IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAN

01:12:27 SMALLER BUSINESSES THAT DON'T HAVE THE SAME STRENGTH? JIM:

01:12:32 THAT IS THE KEY TO OUR VIEW OF THE MARKETS.

01:12:37 I HAVE BEEN IN HIGH YIELD SINCE

01:12:44 THE MID 80'S THIS SINGLE BE SINGLE ISSUE OR HIGH-YIELD

01:12:49 BONDS , THOSE ARE DINOSAURS OF

01:12:56 THE PAST. FOR OUR BUSINESS AT APOLLO, WE ARE FOCUSING A BIG

01:13:01 PORTION OF OUR ORIGINATION ON INVESTMENT GRADE QUALITY RISK.

01:13:08 WHEN YOU WERE CONCERNED ABOUT AN ECONOMIC CYCLE THE PEOPLE OF

01:13:14 A CONCERNED ABOUT SINCE 2016 YOU WANTED TO GO HIGHER AND

01:13:21 HIGHER IN CREDIT QUALITY. LARGER COMPANIES WITH LESS

01:13:23 COMMODITIES. WE WENT THROUGH 2016 AND

01:13:30 LEARNED A LOT OF LESSONS FROM INVESTING WITH ENERGY AND WE

01:13:33 WILL NOT DO THAT AGAIN. JONATHAN:

01:13:37 WE WILL TEASE THAT OUT IN JUST A MOMENT, THE AI RALLY

01:13:40 CONTINUES.

01:13:46 THAT CONVERSATION IS UP NEXT, THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

01:13:59 JONATHAN: LIVE FROM NEW YORK, 60 MINUTES

01:14:06 AWAY FROM THAT ECONOMIC DATA.

01:14:14 WE ARE ONLY DOWN ABOUT .43% ON THE SMP. RUSSELL IS -.4.

01:14:23 YIELDS ARE HIGHER OFF THE BACK OF STRONGER-THAN-EXPECTED

01:14:24 ECONOMIC DATA.

01:14:35 30 YEAR FOUR POINT 36, 10 YEAR AT 4.16.

01:14:39 JOBLESS CLAIMS WERE LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED. LISA:

01:14:45 PICK YOUR DATA POINT, EVERYTHING IS PERFORMING BETTER

01:14:46 THAN EXPECTED.

01:14:52 CITIGROUP SURPRISING, THE KEY

01:14:59 QUESTION IS WHEN DOES THIS CREATE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS?

01:15:02 JONATHAN:

01:15:08 AND NOW THERE EVEN MORE BULLISH? LISA:

01:15:14 THE BULLS ARE GETTING BULLER? JONATHAN:

01:15:18 THAT'S HOW YOU WANT TO FRAME IT. LISA:

01:15:21 I'M PLAYING AROUND WITH IT. JONATHAN:

01:15:25 WHO CUTS FIRST ECB, FEDERAL RESERVE.

01:15:35 THE EURO POSITIVE 1.07 AGAINST THE DOLLAR.

01:15:38 CPI DATA IS 60 MINUTES AWAY

01:15:44 FORECASTING AN ANNUAL BREED BELOW 3% SINCE MARCH 2021.

01:15:53 BLOOMBERG ECONOMICS EXPECTING TO REPORT LESS DISINFLATION AND

01:15:56 COURT CODES. LISA:

01:16:04 THE BROADENING OUT AND CONFIDENCE THAT THIS KID CAN

01:16:10 CONTINUE -- THIS CAN CONTINUE.

01:16:18 HOW MUCH IS HEALTH CARE, RENT, HEALTH CARE? JONATHAN:

01:16:23 AND THEN IT GETS PERSONAL QUICKLY.

01:16:30 THE FED WILL TELL YOU WHAT IT THINKS ABOUT IT.

01:16:34 GOOLSBY WILL BE SPEAKING AND THEN TOMORROW BOSTIC, DAILY,

01:16:42 PLENTY OF FED OFFICIALS ARE HERE TO RESPOND TO THIS. LISA:

01:16:46 THE KEY QUESTION IS, WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED? JONATHAN:

01:16:49 VERY LITTLE. THERE WAS A TAKE AWAY FROM THE

01:16:54 LAST NEWS CONFERENCE.

01:17:00 THAT CHAIRMAN POWELL IS TRYING TO HERD CATS.

01:17:04 BUT THEY ALL SEEM LIKE THEY'RE ON THE SAME PAGE TO ME. LISA:

01:17:09 WHAT IS THE THRESHOLD THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO CUT RATES?

01:17:16 MAYBE THESE BROAD CONCEPTS LIKE CONFIDENCE AND BROADENING OUT

01:17:20 BECOME SUBJECTIVE AND MOMENTARY PAUSES BUT THIS IS A GOOD POINT.

01:17:22 JONATHAN:

01:17:30 WERE HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT CALVING AND A COUPLE OF

01:17:31 MONTHS. MAYBE JUNE, BUT MAYBE NOT.

01:17:41 PRESIDENT BIDEN PUSHING FOR A SIX WEEK PAUSE IN THE FIGHTING

01:17:45 BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS MAKING HIS CASE TO THE KING OF JORDAN.

01:17:58 THE SENATE PASSING 95 BILLION OF AID. ANNMARIE:

01:18:05 FOR NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES AROUND THE WORLD.

01:18:10 WHY THE -- WHILE THEY FEEL THIS IS THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT THIS

01:18:16 IS DEAD ON ARRIVAL IN THE HOUSE

01:18:22 OF REPRESENTATIVES AND THE MIKE JOHNSON SAYING THAT'S FOR

01:18:24 THE SENATE. BUT HE HAS BILL BURNS IN EGYPT

01:18:30 WITH THE HEAD OF MOSSAD. JONATHAN:

01:18:38 SUPER BOWL SETTING A NEW RECORD FOR TELEVISION

01:18:48 VIEWERSHIP.

01:18:49 123 MILLION PEOPLE TUNED IN, A 7% INCREASE WHICH INCLUDES THE

01:18:54 NETWORK AND THE STREAMING DEVICE PARAMOUNT PLUS

01:19:00 DELIVERING THE MOST STREAMED SUPER BOWL EVER. LISA:

01:19:08 I DID SOME FIELD RESEARCH AND THERE WERE A LOT OF HATE

01:19:19 WATCHERS.

01:19:20 THEY HATE THAT TAYLOR SWIFT. I DON'T WANT TO GET HATE MAIL

01:19:25 BECAUSE THE HATERS WANT TO HATE. JONATHAN:

01:19:35 BUT THE NFL IS DOMINATING AND FIGURE. LISA:

01:19:45 THAT'S WHY YOU ARE HAVING A RUSH ON FIVE BUNDLES. ANNMARIE:

01:19:54 IMAGINE IF THERE WAS AN OCCASION WHERE YOU CAN SPEAK

01:19:59 223 REALLY -- 120 3 MILLION VIEWERS. JONATHAN:

01:20:03 WHY DID HE SKIP IT? ANNMARIE: THERE ARE QUESTIONS COMING OUT

01:20:11 ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S ACUITY AND THEY FELT THIS WAS THE

01:20:12 WRONG MESSAGE.

01:20:18 HE WAS OUT SPEAKING ABOUT THE LABOR MARKET AND THE INFLATION

01:20:26 IS CORPORATE GREED, SHRINK INFLATION. JONATHAN:

01:20:36 IF YOU COULD WEAR OF BASEBALL CAP WITH APOLLO AUDIT AND HANG

01:20:41 OUT WITH TRAVIS KELCE WITH THAT WORK? JIM:

01:20:49 IT IS A FIRST FOR RAY INTO THINKING ABOUT CONNECTING OUR

01:20:55 BRAND WITH A BROADER AUDIENCE. FOR US, WE HAVE A 34 YEAR TRACK

01:21:02 RECORD OF PEOPLE THINK OF US AND WHAT WE USED TO BE AS A PE

01:21:05 FIRM AND WE ARE A BROADER PLATFORM. JONATHAN:

01:21:16 LISA IS LAUGHING BECAUSE I WENT FROM FOOTBALL TO GOLF. JIM:

01:21:21 I AM A BUFFALO BILLS FAN SO IT WAS A TOUGH GAME FOR ME TO

01:21:22 WATCH. JONATHAN:

01:21:29 CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW 401(K)S ARE GOING TO CHANGE AS WELL?

01:21:35 HOW WAS THIS ALL GOING TO CHANGE IN THE WEEKS, MONTHS,

01:21:37 YEARS TO COME? JIM:

01:21:44 MARK POINTED OUT THE IRONY OF SAVING FOR 20, 30 YEARS BECAUSE

01:21:52 OF THE SYSTEMATIC STRUCTURE DEMANDING LIQUIDITY AND THAT

01:21:58 LIQUID IS SAFE AND ILLIQUID IS RISKY BUT THAT PARADIGM NEEDS

01:22:00 TO BE CHALLENGED.

01:22:06 WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MARKET STRUCTURE AND PASSIVE AND

01:22:11 UNDERLYING PERFORMANCE OF A VARIETY OF ILLIQUID

01:22:16 ALTERNATIVES HAVE PERFORMED IN A ROBUST MANNER ACROSS SEVERAL

01:22:22 CYCLES.

01:22:23 THE SO-CALLED ENDOWMENT MODEL HAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE

01:22:28 LIQUIDITY STRUCTURE THEY DON'T HAVE TO LIVE BY SO IF YOU HAVE

01:22:35 A BROAD D.C. MARKET WITH LONG-TERM

01:22:39 OBJECTIVES OF RETIREMENT INCOME AND SAFETY, WHY ARE WE EXPOSING

01:22:43 THEM TO LIQUID, VOLATILE ASPECTS? LISA:

01:22:48 THERE IS A CONCERN THAT IF YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO WITHDRAW

01:22:55 AND INVESTING IN LONG-TERM INVESTMENT IT CREATES A

01:22:58 POTENTIAL FOR A RUN. IF THERE IS A TRIGGER AND

01:23:02 PEOPLE WITHDRAW THEIR CASH IT CAN CREATE A SPIRAL? JIM:

01:23:06 IF YOU'RE ENDED D.C. PLAN YOU ARE IN DAILY LIQUIDITY

01:23:11 FUNDS. THAT LIQUIDITY DRAIN IS ALREADY

01:23:15 IN THE MARKETS.

01:23:24 BUT WE HAVE BEEN CAREFUL NOT TO OFFER DAILY LIQUIDITY PRODUCTS

01:23:28 BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT I GET INTO THAT ASSET LIABILITY MISMATCH.

01:23:36 THE REASON ANNUITIES HAVE DONE WELL IS BECAUSE THERE IS THE

01:23:38 LONGER DURATION OF THOSE VEHICLES TO BE ABLE TO REINVEST

01:23:44 VERSUS A SAVINGS ACCOUNT THAT WE SAW WITH SVB. LISA:

01:23:49 IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE

01:23:55 EVERYONE WANTS EXPOSURE TO PRIVATE ASSETS THAT THERE ARE

01:23:59 BAD ACTORS THAT COULD CREATE FOR SELLING? JIM:

01:24:06 YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE WEAKEST COMPETITOR MAY

01:24:09 DO. BUT IN MY CAREER THE ONE THAT

01:24:15 STICKS OUT TO ME IS THE U.K.

01:24:21 PENSIONS WITH THE LDI CRISIS, THOSE ARE LONG-DURATION

01:24:27 INVESTORS WHICH HAD TO SELL ALL OF THEIR LIABILITY.

01:24:38 I THINK IT IS INTERESTING THAT ALL OF THE FOLKS HAVE NOT GONE

01:24:45 INTO A DAILY LIQUIDITY PRODUCT.

01:24:52 IF YOU ARE A PROVIDER OF THOSE HOW YOU GO DOWN THAT PATH BUT

01:24:58 WE ARE FOCUSED WITH THE DISCIPLINE OF MAKING SURE WE

01:25:02 NEVER GET PULLED AWAY FROM THE TABLE ON A MANDATE. JONATHAN:

01:25:13 I JUST WANT MY 401(K) WITH ARM, WHICH HAS DOUBLED IN

01:25:18 THREE DAYS. THE WINNERS OF THE YEAR, NVIDIA

01:25:27 AND META OVERTAKING THE MARKET VALUE OF AMAZON BRIEFLY.

01:25:32 HAVE YOU CALLED THIS A FRENZY YET? MANDEEP:

01:25:42 ALL OF THE STOCK MOVES ARE NOT VALIDATED BY EARNINGS

01:25:43 SURVEILLANCE. YOU WANT TO SEE ESTIMATES CATCH

01:25:51 UP AND WHEN THERE IS A 90% MOVE THAT TELLS YOU THERE IS A LOT

01:25:56 YOU ARE PAYING OUT FOR FUTURE EARNINGS.

01:26:01 WHO KNOWS WHAT THE NORMALIZED LEVEL OF EARNINGS IS.

01:26:06 WITH CHIPS, THE SUPPLY TENDS TO

01:26:12 CATCH UP, THERE IS THAT SUPPLY

01:26:18 COMPONENT EVERY R&D RESOURCE IS DEVELOPING SHIP TO TRAIN MODELS.

01:26:26 YOU ARE PAYING FOR 20 YEARS FORWARD IN TERMS OF EARNINGS.

01:26:28 LISA: WHO IS BEHIND THIS KIND OF MOVE?

01:26:35 RETAIL INVESTORS WHO WANT TO GET AHEAD OR FUND MANAGERS WHO

01:26:39 HAVE BEEN CAUGHT OFF SIDES?

01:26:48 BOWL BECOMES FULL -- BULL BECOMES BULL.

01:26:54 MANDEEP: THERE IS A FEAR OF MISSING OUT

01:27:00 BUT IT HASN'T TRANSLATED INTO REAL REVENUES.

01:27:09 NVIDIA IS SHOWING LATER DATA CENTER GROWTH.

01:27:17 WITH ALL THE OTHERS, WHERE ARE THE REAL REVENUES AND HOW LONG

01:27:21 WILL IT TAKE FOR THEM TO SHOW UP IN THE NUMBERS?

01:27:25 EVERYONE IS CHANGING THAT. THERE IS A REAL KABBALIST WITH

01:27:35 THE FED FUNDS STOCK COMING DOWN

01:27:43 -- THERE IS A REAL KABBCATALYST. JONATHAN:

01:27:53 THE NUMBERS FROM NVIDIA ARE A WEEK FROM TOMORROW. JIM:

01:28:01 THEY HAVE TO BE THAT THE RATES BECAUSE THEY HAVE SET

01:28:02 EXPECTATIONS LIKE THAT FOR THE PAST THREE ORDERS.

01:28:08 IF YOU'RE INVESTING IN A LONG-DURATION ASSET, HOW LONG

01:28:12 CAN YOU HOLD THIS FOR IN THE MARKET IS NOT THINKING LIKE

01:28:14 THAT. JONATHAN:

01:28:21 HERE IS YOUR BLOOMBERG DEBRIEF WITH DANNY BERGER. DANI:

01:28:27 THE LATEST RALLY HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY THE APPROVAL OF THE

01:28:34 APPROVAL OF A SPOTS ETF.

01:28:37 IT REMAINS 19,000 BELOW ITS ALL-TIME HIGH. U.S.

01:28:42 SENATE APPROVED A 95 BILLION DOLLAR BILL FOR ASSISTANCE BUT

01:28:47 NOW THE LEGISLATION FACES AND A BATTLE IN THE HOUSE.

01:28:53 SENATORS PASSED IT THIS MORNING AND REPUBLICAN LEADERS IN THE

01:28:59 HOUSE SAY PRESIDENT BIDEN NEEDS TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST BORDER

01:29:12 IMMIGRATION FIRST. TOM SWAZI IS A RACE ON BIDENS POLICIES.

01:29:18 JONATHAN: WE ALWAYS SAY THIS, TURN OUT

01:29:23 SO IMPORTANT. WHO IS IT MORE IMPORTANT FOR US?

01:29:31 ANNMARIE: IF YOU LOOK AT THE MAKEUP OF

01:29:34 THIS DISTRICT THERE ARE SO MANY VOTERS WHO ARE NOT DECIDED

01:29:37 ENDED BUSINESS SWING DISTRICT. THAT IS WHY EVERYONE IS FOCUSED

01:29:42 ON IT. THAT'S WHY EVERYONE IS FOCUSED

01:29:46 ON THE SNOW. JONATHAN: TURNOUT, I GET IT.

01:29:54 >> THE REASON PEOPLE SHOULD CARE ABOUT UKRAINE IS THAT IT

01:29:59 IS PRO-AMERICAN COUNTRY BUT PUTIN SAID THAT ONCE HE TAKES

01:30:03 UKRAINE THE BALTICS ARE NEXT. JONATHAN:

01:30:08 THAT CONVERSATION THIS NEXT, THIS IS LIMBURG.

01:30:24 JONATHAN: CPI IS 42 MINUTES AWAY.

01:30:32 SMP IS -.4%. 10 YEAR AT 4.15.

01:30:42 THEY ARE MAKING THE CASE FOR AID TO UKRAINE.

01:30:47 >> OUR WHOLE GOAL IS TO PREVENT WAR.

01:30:52 IF YOU LOOK AT RUSSIA RIGHT NOW THE REASON PEOPLE SHOULD CARE

01:30:56 ABOUT UKRAINE IS CITED AS A PRO-AMERICAN COUNTRY BUT LOOK

01:30:59 AT WHAT PUTIN SAID, ONCE HE TAKES UKRAINE POLAND AND THE

01:31:05 BALKANS ARE NEXT AND THAT PUTS THE U.S. THAT WERE. JONATHAN:

01:31:12 NIKKI HALEY SAYING IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE RUSSIA

01:31:13 INVADES THE NATO TERRITORY.

01:31:20 THE SENATE PASSING IN A BILL SETTING UP A SHOW DOWN THE

01:31:21 HOUSE.

01:31:27 LET'S TALK ABOUT THE RESPONSE OF THE COMMENTS FROM PRESIDENT

01:31:32 TRUMP WITH THE NATO SECRETARY GENERAL SAYING TRUMP IS

01:31:35 IRRESPONSIBLE AND DANGEROUS. TO WHAT EXTENT UNDERMINES THE

01:31:40 DEFENSE CLAUSE OF NATO?

01:31:45 >> IT CREATES THE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHERE AMERICA'S

01:31:50 COMMITMENT TO NATO AND TRANSATLANTIC SECURITY IN THIS

01:31:55 RUN-UP TO THE ELECTION AND IT IS NOT HELPED BY THE STRUGGLE

01:32:04 TO GET THE FOREIGN AID PACKAGE THROUGH THAT HOUSE.

01:32:10 THE ANTICS SURROUNDING THAT ALONGSIDE T DONALD TRUMP'S

01:32:19 COMMENTS ABSENT EUROPEAN LEADERS .

01:32:21 SOME PEOPLE HAVE TURNED THIS INTO A CONVERSATION ABOUT

01:32:24 PUSHING NATO MEMBERS TO GET UP SO THAT 2% OF SPENDING ON

01:32:26 DEFENSE.

01:32:33 THAT IS AN ONGOING CONCERN SINCE 2014 BUT THE BROADER

01:32:38 CONCERN IS THAT WE HAVE A CANDIDATE LIKELY TO BE THE

01:32:41 REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE SAYING HE DOES NOT CARE WHAT RUSSIA DOES

01:32:46 TOO AMERICA'S CLOSEST ALLIES.

01:32:52 IT IS DANGEROUS AND UNSETTLING AT THE LEASE. ANNMARIE:

01:32:59 BUT HAVEN'T THEY HEARD THIS BEFORE PUBLICLY AND BEHIND

01:33:04 CLOSED DOORS AND VIEW IT AS TRUMP USING LEVERAGE TO FORCE

01:33:07 EUROPEAN ALLIES STATED THEIR 2% TARGET?

01:33:12 >> NOBODY IS CERTAIN WHAT COMES NEXT IF DONALD TRUMP HITS THE

01:33:20 WHITE HOUSE.

01:33:21 THERE IS A CONCERN THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS A MAN WHO DID NOT

01:33:25 EXPECT TO BE PRESIDENT WHO HAVE

01:33:31 A LOT OF IDEAS AND BELIEFS AND SCRAMBLING BUT AS WE LOOK AHEAD

01:33:38 TO WHAT HE WOULD DO IN THE 900 PAGE DOCUMENT PROJECT 2025 THAT

01:33:46 HERITAGE HAS PUT OUT WHICH INCLUDE STATEMENTS ON FOREIGN

01:33:52 POLICY.

01:33:53 THIS IS A PRESIDENT DESPITE THE FACT THAT REPORT DOES NOT ALIGN

01:34:03 WITH DONALD TRUMP IT IS CLEAR, HE HAS A MUCH MORE SERIOUS

01:34:08 INTENTION AND PLAN IF YOU WERE TO RETURN.

01:34:13 HE CREATED UNCERTAINTY BUT WORKING TO BE REELECTED WE

01:34:21 WOULD BE LOOKING AT A DIFFERENT PRESIDENT FROM 2016-2020.

01:34:24 ANNMARIE: IT LOOKS LIKE HE IS PUTTING

01:34:28 PRESSURE ON REPUBLICANS TO REMOVE AID FROM UKRAINE.

01:34:35 IT IS DEAD ON ARRIVAL IN THE HOUSE. WHERE DO YOU SEE THE U.S.

01:34:37 ASSISTANCE TO UKRAINE THIS YEAR? THIS IS JUST NOT GET DONE?

01:34:42 LESLIE: WHAT WE KNOW AS WE SPEAK TO

01:34:50 MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IS THAT

01:34:56 THERE IS A MAJORITY, A SILENT MAJORITY OF MEMBERS WHO WOULD

01:34:59 LIKE TO SEE THIS DEFENSE SUPPORT CONTINUE FOR UKRAINE

01:35:03 BUT THE RUPTURE WITHIN THE PARTY IS EXTRAORDINARY.

01:35:12 SENATOR GRAHAM WHO TRAVELS TO MUNICH SECURITY CRISIS SAID HE

01:35:20 WOULD GO TO THE BORDER AND MITCH MCCONNELL STANDING UP FOR

01:35:29 UKRAINE.

01:35:30 WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP LURKING IN THE BACKGROUND PUTTING THE

01:35:34 EMPHASIS ON BORDER SECURITY AND NOT WANTING TO SEE A DEAL AND

01:35:41 PLAYED THE ROLE OF DISRUPTOR AROUND SOMETHING THAT IS VERY

01:35:48 SERIOUS.

01:35:49 IT IS REALLY TURNING INTO A SHARP POINT FOR THE REPUBLICAN

01:35:52 PARTY. WILL THEY BE ABLE TO GET THE

01:35:54 SUPPORT THROUGH FOR UKRAINE?

01:36:02 I STILL BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL BUT IT IS HARD TO MAP OUT.

01:36:06 WE NEED CLEVER PEOPLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW THAT WILL HAPPEN.

01:36:12 JONATHAN: IT IS A STRUGGLE.

01:36:15 LESLIE, WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE.

01:36:20 JIM, YOU HAVE ALLUDED TO HOW MUCH FINANCE HAS CHANGED IN THE

01:36:22 PAST 25 YEARS.

01:36:25 CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH WHAT THIS WILL LOOK LIKE IN THE NEXT

01:36:36 10?

01:36:37 JIM:

01:36:44 THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF OPEN ARCHITECTURE, WE WERE VERY MUCH

01:36:48 DEFINED IN THE TAILWINDS OF THE LAST 30-40 YEARS.

01:36:52 GLOBALIZATION, TECHNOLOGY, LOWER RATES.

01:36:58 THERE WAS MASSIVE GROWTH IN THE GLOBAL GROWTH MARKETS.

01:37:07 THE MONETARY POLICY HAD A MASSIVE IMPACT.

01:37:11 NOW WE ARE GETTING TO A LEVEL SIDE OF THE FUTURE.

01:37:17 THE LARGEST DOMINANT PLAYERS AND CAPITAL FORMATION, FIXED

01:37:21 INCOME, EQUITY, BANKS WILL PLAY

01:37:28 ON A GLOBAL STAGE AND AN OPEN ARCHITECTURE MANNER.

01:37:32 PEOPLE WILL PARTNER WITH FOLKS ENDED OPENING UP OF HOW PEOPLE

01:37:35 THINK ABOUT ALTERNATIVES IN RETIREMENT SAVINGS.

01:37:42 YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING IN CANADA, AUSTRALIA AND MEXICO.

01:37:49 IT WILL BE LONGER-TERM RETIREMENT SAVINGS BUT WITH A

01:37:51 LOT MORE OPEN ARCHITECTURE. LISA: WHO WILL YOUR BIGGEST

01:37:56 COMPETITOR B? LESLIE:

01:38:05 A COMBINATION OF EXISTING COMPETITORS TODAY. JONATHAN:

01:38:08 HE IS NOT GOING TO NAME THEM. LISA:

01:38:14 I JUST WANT TO KNOW IS THAT BANKS, ASSET MANAGERS, TECH

01:38:16 COMPANIES? JIM:

01:38:25 PEOPLE TALK ABOUT TRANSACTIONS OR COMPETITORS.

01:38:27 YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN ADVANTAGE OF THE PRODUCT YOU'RE

01:38:29 DELIVERING. YOU CAN HAVE GREAT HEADLINES

01:38:33 AND IDEAS BUT YOU HAVE TO DELIVER PRODUCT. JONATHAN:

01:38:37 WE JUST WANTS A MEDIA DRAMA. JIM:

01:38:43 I'M HERE TO INVEST. JONATHAN:

01:38:58 >> THE INFLATION PROBLEM IS NOT GOING AWAY.

01:39:01 IT WILL CONTINUE TO CREATE MORE AND MORE RISK OF FINANCIAL

01:39:03 STABILITY ISSUES DOWN THE ROAD.

01:39:07 >> I SEE THIS THAT COULD PERHAPS JEOPARDIZE THIS

01:39:10 INFLATION.

01:39:13 >> EVERY SINGLE INVESTOR IS PRICING IN A SOFT LANDING WHICH

01:39:15 GETS ME QUITE NERVOUS.

01:39:21 >> WE NEED LESS DOVISH DATA AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH TO

01:39:24 SEND SOME PAIN ACROSS THE ASSET CLASSES.

01:39:28 >> IF WE WERE TO GET AN UPSIDE SURPRISE AND CPI, FOLKS MIGHT

01:39:30 SAY, IS THIS THING OVERHEATING?

01:39:33 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE. JONATHAN:

01:39:35 LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY THIS MORNING, GOOD MORNING, GOOD

01:39:40 MORNING. THE THIRD HOUR OF BLOOMBERG

01:39:43 SURVEILLANCE BEGINS NOW.

01:39:50 30 MINUTES AWAY FROM THE CPI REPORT IN AMERICAN WE ARE

01:39:52 LOOKING FOR A TO HANDLE ON HEADLINE INFLATION. LISA:

01:39:58 MY TAKE AWAY IS THINGS ARE -- PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR THIS TO

01:40:00 BE MORE BULLISH. IF YOU GET A DOWNSIDE SURPRISE,

01:40:01 WATCH OUT. IT WILL BE A RIPROARING RALLY

01:40:03 BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE THE TONE WE'RE HEARING FROM

01:40:07 EVERYBODY. JONATHAN: WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR TODAY?

01:40:10 IS IT IN-LINE OR MORE OF THE SAME? LISA:

01:40:15 IT DEPENDS HOW PEOPLE ARE FEELING BUT WE WILL BE DEALING

01:40:19 WITH POTENTIALLY THE LOWEST INFLATION RATE GOING BACK TO

01:40:23 EARLY 2021 AT A TIME WHEN PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO SNIFF

01:40:28 OUT MAYBE A BROADENING OUT, MAYBE NOT, I DON'T KNOW, IT

01:40:29 DEPENDS ON YOUR BIAS. ANNMARIE: IT DEPENDS WHAT'S PLAYING OUT

01:40:34 AT THE WHITE HOUSE. THEY CONTINUOUSLY TOUT THINGS

01:40:40 LIKE THE MICHIGAN SURVEY AND PEOPLE START TO FEEL BETTER

01:40:41 ABOUT THE ECONOMY. THIS IS THE LAST HURDLE WHEN IT

01:40:45 COMES TO INFLATION AND THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE

01:40:48 ARE FEELING BETTER ABOUT PURCHASING POWER BECAUSE THE

01:40:50 JOBS MARKET, THE PRESIDENT WILL REMIND YOU TODAY WHEN HE MAKES

01:40:55 HIS INFLATION STATEMENT, HAS UNEMPLOYMENT UNDER 4% FOR TWO

01:40:57 YEARS BUT CAN THEY GET OVER THE FINAL BUMP? JONATHAN:

01:41:02 4% IS WHERE THE 10 YEAR YIELD WAS ON THE LAST INFLATION PRINT.

01:41:06 WE ARE NORTH OF 4% RIGHT NOW ON THE 10 YEAR.

01:41:12 THE S&P 500 IS NEGATIVE BY 0.4%. THAT'S THE PRICE ACTION SO

01:41:19 LET'S GET YOU THE WEATHER UPDATE FOR THE TRI-STATE AREA

01:41:25 IN 10 MINUTES TIME.

01:41:27 COMING UP THROUGH THE HOUR, HARRIS ASSOCIATES LOOKING AHEAD

01:41:30 TO CPI THEN CONCENTRATION RISK IN THE EQUITY MARKET AND

01:41:34 TODAY'S INFLATION PRINT AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE MARKETS.

01:41:38 THE TOP STORY IS COUNTING DOWN TO U.S.

01:41:41 CPI, THE INFLATION REPORT COMING IN LESS THAN 30 MINUTES.

01:41:46 THE HEADLINE NUMBER COULD DROP BELOW 3% FOR THE FIRST TIME

01:41:48 SINCE 2021. EQUITY MARKETS ARE AT AN

01:41:53 ALL-TIME HIGH IN THE HOPES THAT MAYBE THIS RALLY CAN BROADEN BE

01:41:55 THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN TO THINGS OUTSIDE THE U.S.

01:41:57 AND EUROPE AND PERHAPS EVEN ASIA.

01:42:02 DAVID HARRIS JOINS US RIGHT NOW. CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE

01:42:07 OPPORTUNITY BE ON THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN INTO EUROPE

01:42:12 AND ELSEWHERE?

01:42:13 >> ESPECIALLY FOR INVESTORS LIKE OURSELVES, WE FOCUS ON

01:42:16 COMPANY SPECIFIC FACTORS, VALUATION METRICS WHICH IS LOW

01:42:19 PRICE, I QUALITY.

01:42:21 IT'S A REALLY GOOD SET OF OPPORTUNITIES OUTSIDE THE

01:42:27 UNITED STATES. IT'S PARTICULARLY IN EUROPE

01:42:32 WHERE IN ESSENCE, YOU CAN FIND HIGH-QUALITY IS IS, 12 TIMES

01:42:37 EARNINGS, SOMETIMES EIGHT TIMES EARNINGS.

01:42:41 IT'S YIELDING MORE THAN THE PRICE RATIOS, GENERATING LOTS

01:42:47 OF CASH, EXCESS CASH ON BALANCE SHEETS, PRE-CASH FLOW YIELDS

01:42:48 ARE LOW DOUBLE DIGITS. THESE VALUATION METRICS FOR US

01:42:53 ARE JUST HAPPY HUNTING GROUNDS. JONATHAN:

01:42:57 NOT JUST YOU BUT I'M GOING THROUGH SOME NAMES WHERE THERE

01:43:02 IS A MASSIVE DEAL OVER THE LAST 12 MONTHS.

01:43:09 LUXURY PLAYERS, CHIPS, WE'VE SEEN BIG MOVES IN THESE MARKETS.

01:43:14 THE LIKES OF THE DAX AND THE STOXX 50 HAD MOVES LAST YEAR

01:43:17 BUT NOT AS GOOD AS THE NASDAQ 100.

01:43:22 WHAT ARE THE KIND OF COMPANIES YOU ARE FOCUSED ON?

01:43:26 >> HEADLINE GRABBING NAMES ARE BLINDING INVESTORS FROM WHAT'S

01:43:28 BEEN BENEATH THOSE NAMES.

01:43:34 TAKE COMPANIES IN EUROPE, THE FINANCIAL SECTOR, MAJOR

01:43:39 FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS LIKE BNP PARIBAS AND FRANCE.

01:43:45 THESE ARE COMPANIES THAT LITERALLY TRADE AT SEVEN TIMES

01:43:48 EARNINGS AND THE YIELD IS A MOST 10% AND HAVE EXCESS CASH

01:43:52 AND ARE BUYING BACK THEIR SHARES AT AN AGGRESSIVE AMOUNT

01:43:55 AND EVERYONE KIND OF FORGETS ABOUT THESE BECAUSE THEY ARE

01:44:00 BEING SHIELDED OR BLINDED BY THE THEME STOCKS LIKE THAT GOP

01:44:04 ONES, THE SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANIES.

01:44:06 INDUSTRIALS ARE THE SAME THING WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE GERMAN

01:44:14 PREMIUM AUTOMAKERS, BMW, MERCEDES-BENZ, THEY TRADE AT

01:44:17 ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE TIMES EARNINGS AND THE YIELD IS

01:44:20 ALMOST 10%. THEY HAVE SO MUCH EXCESS CASH

01:44:24 ON THEIR BALANCE SHEETS THAT THEY ARE BUYING BACK SHARES AS

01:44:26 WELL. THESE ARE THE TYPES OF BUSINESSES NO ONE SEEMS

01:44:29 INTERESTED IN. NO ONE IS FOCUSED ON CASH FLOW

01:44:35 AND VALUATIONS WHICH TO US PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY.

01:44:38 EVENTUALLY, WE WILL COME DOWN TO EARTH AND WE WILL LOOK AT

01:44:42 WHAT MAKES A BUSINESS VALUABLE AND THAT'S THE CASH RICH IT

01:44:43 GENERATES. LISA:

01:44:51 PEOPLE START -- STOP BY LINE -- BUYINGARM.

01:44:53 I WANT TO GO TO BNP PARIBAS. THERE WASN'T ISSUE WITH CREDIT

01:44:59 SUISSE AND I KNOW THAT WAS ONE STOCK YOU GOT FULLY OUT OF

01:45:02 AFTER BEING A HEAVY INVESTOR LAST MARCH.

01:45:05 WHAT DID YOU LEARN FROM THAT EPISODE? HOW DOES IT COLOR YOUR

01:45:10 INVESTMENT IN EUROPEAN BANK STOCKS TODAY?

01:45:14 >> IN ANY BANK STOCKS, YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PRICE UNCERTAINTY

01:45:16 AND SOME OF THEIR BUSINESSES. YOU DON'T HAVE CLEAR

01:45:21 TRANSPARENCY INTO THE ASSETS OF EVERY SINGLE BANK.

01:45:25 WHAT YOU HAVE TO RELY UPON IS THE ECONOMY AND THE REPUTATION

01:45:29 OF THE QUALITY OF THE MANAGEMENT TEAM.

01:45:32 WHAT WE GOT ONE WITH CREDIT SUISSE WAS WE BELIEVED AT SOME

01:45:37 POINT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO TURN AROUND THEIR INVESTMENT

01:45:38 BANK. THE OTHER THREE AREAS OF THE

01:45:43 BUSINESS DID JUST FINE THROUGH THE CYCLE, THE PRIVATE BANK,

01:45:45 THE ASSET MANAGEMENT, THE UNIVERSAL BANK.

01:45:49 ALL OF THE STRENGTHS IN THOSE THREE BUSINESSES WERE BLINDED

01:45:53 BY THE INEPTITUDE OF THE INVESTMENT BANK.

01:45:56 OUR BELIEF WAS THAT IF THEY COULD TURN THAT AROUND, IF THEY

01:46:02 COULD FIX THAT, THE OTHER THREE BUSINESSES THEN, THE LIGHT

01:46:04 WOULD SHINE ON THE QUALITY OF THE OTHER THREE BUSINESSES.

01:46:07 WITH A SITUATION LIKE BNP PARIBAS, WE DON'T HAVE ANY NEED

01:46:10 FOR A TURNAROUND IN ANY OF THEIR BUSINESSES.

01:46:17 THIS HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY EXTREMELY WELL-RUN COMPANY,

01:46:21 GOOD CULTURE OF RISK, VERY GOOD AT GROWING BOOK VALUE OVER THE

01:46:25 LAST 10 YEARS AT OVER SEVEN OR 8% PER YEAR AND TODAY THE

01:46:29 COMPANY TRADES AT 2/3 BOOK VALUE AND IT YIELDS WHEN YOU

01:46:33 ADD IN THE STOCK BUYBACK, IT ADDS WELL INTO THE DOUBLE

01:46:37 DIGITS. WHAT YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF

01:46:41 AND HOPE THEY CAN FIX SOMETHING. WE SOLD OUT OF CREDIT SUISSE

01:46:44 AND STARTED SELLING IT AT THE END OF 2022.

01:46:48 WHEN THEY RELEASED THEIR PLAN TO RESTRUCTURE, WE THOUGHT IT

01:46:50 WAS AN EXTREMELY FAULTY PLAN. WE THOUGHT AFTER ALL THIS TIME,

01:46:54 AFTER ALL THIS HOPE, THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO FIX

01:46:59 THIS. BY THE WAY, THE PROBLEMS

01:47:02 INVESTMENT BANK AS WE KNOW AT THE END OF 2022 WERE FINALLY

01:47:05 STARTING TO DRIP INTO THE OTHER STRONG DIVISIONS.

01:47:08 THIS IS ONE OF THE LESSONS. IF THERE IS A BAD DIVISION, IT

01:47:13 MIGHT BE BAD FOR REASON AND SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO ASSUME

01:47:14 IT'S IRREPARABLE. LISA: WAS IT A ONE OFF?

01:47:21 DO YOU SEE OTHER ISSUES, SPECIFIC CONCERNS AND OTHER

01:47:26 BANKS WHETHER IT'S IN EUROPE OR THE U.S. THAT HAVEN'T BEEN FULLY

01:47:27 IDENTIFIED?

01:47:29 >> WAS A ONE OFF?

01:47:31 IT WAS A ONE OFF I BELIEVE IN THE GREATER SCHEME OF THE

01:47:39 EUROPEAN BANKING SECTOR.

01:47:41 LIKE ANY COMPANY IN ANY REGION, THEY WILL RUN INTO PROBLEMS.

01:47:45 SILICON VALLEY BANK I WOULD ARGUE IS A ONE OFF BECAUSE THEY

01:47:50 WERE SO IRRESPONSIBLE ON DURATION MATCHING THAT IT

01:47:52 WASN'T A CREDIT QUALITY ISSUE. IT WAS THIS DURATION MATCHING

01:47:55 WITH ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THEY WERE SO IRRESPONSIBLE.

01:47:58 MANY BANKS ARE NOT SEVERE RESPONSIBLE.

01:48:01 I NEVER THOUGHT IT WAS SYSTEMATIC.

01:48:06 I DO BELIEVE IT WAS MORE OF A ONE-OFF IN THE SILICON VALLEY

01:48:09 BANK AND THE OTHER REGIONALS WHO GOT CAUGHT UP WITH THE SAME

01:48:13 LACK OF RISK CONTROL, SAME THING IN EUROPE.

01:48:21 COMPANY LIKE BNP OR LLOYD'S, THESE ARE THE FINANCIALS WE

01:48:27 HAVE THAT HAVE NEVER HAD MAJOR QUALITY COMPLIANCE RISK ISSUES.

01:48:31 THIS IS WHAT ONE HAS TO LOOK FOR IS THE CULTURE OF RISK

01:48:33 CONTROL. IN BANKS, THIS IS NUMBER ONE,

01:48:35 RISK IS NUMBER ONE. JONATHAN: LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR APPROACH

01:48:39 TO INVESTING. WE CAUGHT UP WITH APOLLO IN THE

01:48:43 PREVIOUS HOUR. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT PASSIVE

01:48:48 INVESTING OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS WITH THE EXPLOSION OF IT

01:48:52 AND GETTING SESSION THE BIGGER GETTING BIGGER WITH MONEY GOING

01:48:54 INTO EQUITY MARKETS AND GOING INTO THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN LIKE

01:48:56 OVER THE LAST 12 MONTHS. HOW WOULD YOU FRAME THINGS?

01:49:03 DO YOU SEE PASSIVE INVESTING AS THE ENEMY TO THE KIND OF THING

01:49:05 YOU DO EVERY SINGLE DAY? WHAT USE IS IT IF YOU FIND A

01:49:10 NAME THAT LOOKS GOOD ON PAPER BUT THE MONEY NEVER COMES.

01:49:15 >> PASSIVE INVESTING ISN'T ACTIVE INVESTORS FRIEND.

01:49:18 I SAY THIS BECAUSE THE WEIGHT OF MONEY GOING INTO PASSIVE

01:49:24 INVESTING MEANS THAT MONEY IS JUST BEING INVESTED IN

01:49:27 BUSINESSES IN ESSENCE BECAUSE THEY ARE THERE.

01:49:31 THIS CREATES AN EFFICIENT PRICING OF ASSETS.

01:49:36 IN THE SHORT TERM AND MAYBE THE MEDIUM TERM, YOU LISTEN TO

01:49:39 DAVID EINHORN LAST WEEK, HE TALKS ABOUT THE CHALLENGES

01:49:42 COMPETING AGAINST THESE. THE WAY THE MONEY MOVES INTO

01:49:47 THIS, THE STOCKS THAT MARKET CAPS GET BIGGER AND BIGGER, IT

01:49:53 REMINDS ME OF THE IDEA OF PORTFOLIO INSURANCE, AS THE

01:49:54 STOCK PRICE GOES UP, YOU BUY MORE OF IT.

01:50:00 WHEN CARS GO UP, YOU DON'T BUY MORE CARS PRAYED WHEN THE PRICE

01:50:02 OF BUSINESSES GO UP, IT GOES AGAINST ECONOMIC FUNDAMENTALS

01:50:04 TO BUY MORE OF THEM. IN THE LONG TERM, THIS CREATES

01:50:11 OPPORTUNITY FOR ACTIVE INVESTORS WHICH WILL EXPLOIT

01:50:13 THESE MARKET INEFFICIENCIES. WOULD ALSO LOOK AT MORE

01:50:15 VOLATILE.

01:50:23 SOMETIMES OUR CLIENTS DON'T LIKE THE VARYING INDEX.

01:50:27 IT ULTIMATELY CREATES MARKET INEFFICIENCY WHICH IS GOOD FOR

01:50:31 THE ACTIVE INVESTOR BUT IN THE SHORT-TERM, IT CERTAINLY ISN'T

01:50:37 PAINLESS FOR US LONG ONLY, BORING, VALUE, BOTTOMS UP

01:50:41 INVESTORS. WE SOMETIMES GET KIND OF BLOWN

01:50:45 AWAY WHERE THE WEIGHT OF MONEY IS GOING WHERE WE MAY BE

01:50:47 INVESTED, WHERE THE WEIGHT OF MONEY IS COMING FROM.

01:50:50 THAT MEANS WEAKNESS. JONATHAN: I APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSE TO

01:50:54 THAT. WE WOULD LOVE TO DO A ROUNDTABLE WITH YOU.

01:50:58 IT'S GOOD TO CATCH UP WITH YOU.

01:51:05 PASSIVE INVESTING IS THE FRIEND OF WHAT DAVID DOES EVERY DAY.

01:51:07 LISA: IT'S A MATTER WHICH STOCKS YOU

01:51:11 ARE LOOKING AT AND IT MATTERS WHAT YOUR THESIS IS BUT THIS IS

01:51:12 HOW TRADERS ARE TRADING NOW. IT'S AROUND THESE BASKETS AND

01:51:17 WHETHER YOU USE THEM TO BENEFIT YOU WERE NOT.

01:51:20 THIS IS THE WAY THE NEW STRUCTURE IS PLAYING OUT.

01:51:22 JONATHAN: EQUITY FUTURES ARE NEGATIVE BY

01:51:25 ONE THIRD OF 1%. WE ARE 18 MINUTES AWAY FROM THE

01:51:27 CPI PRINT. HERE IS YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF.

01:51:34 DANI: A POWERFUL WINTER STORM IS SET

01:51:37 TO HIT THE NORTHEAST TODAY IN THE U.S.

01:51:39 WITH HEAVY SNOW ACROSS THE REGION NEW YORK CITY PUBLIC

01:51:43 SCHOOLS WILL DO CLASSES REMOTELY AND EXPECTING AS MUCH

01:51:44 IS EIGHT INCHES OF SNOW FORECAST. ARTS OF NORTHERN NEW

01:51:50 JERSEY AND EASTERN PENNSYLVANIA AND SOUTHERN WING WHEN COULD

01:51:51 SEE A FOOT OF SNOW AND HUNDREDS OF FLIGHTS HAVE BEEN CANCELED

01:51:54 INTO REGIONAL AIRPORTS.

01:52:00 HIS SO-CALLED THAT FINGER TRADE IS BEING BLAMED FOR S&L SHARES.

01:52:07 THERE WAS A THREE MINUTE TRADING HALT DUE TO VOLATILITY.

01:52:13 IT WAS THE BIGGEST ON INTRADAY BASIS SINCE OCTOBER, 2022.

01:52:17 PRESIDENT BIDEN IS FORMING A TASK FORCE TO ADDRESS THE

01:52:19 MISHANDLING OF CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS DURING PRESIDENTIAL

01:52:21 TRANSMISSIONS. THEY HAD FOUND THAT BIDEN KEPT

01:52:24 IN HIS POSSESSION AFTER HE WAS VICE PRESIDENT.

01:52:28 HOUSE OFFICIALS CALLED IT SYSTEMATIC ISSUE AFFECTING BOTH

01:52:30 PARTIES. THE TASK FORCE WILL PROVIDE

01:52:34 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE NEXT PRESIDENTIAL TRANSITION.

01:52:35 THAT'S YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF. JONATHAN: THANK YOU.

01:52:39 UP NEXT, WE LOOK AT CONCENTRATION RISK.

01:52:41 >> NARROW LEADERSHIP, EVEN IF IT CONTINUES, IT'S NOT A

01:52:44 HEALTHY THING. IT'S MAKING THE S&P 500 AND

01:52:48 GROWTH INDICES VERY CONCENTRATED. JONATHAN:

01:52:52 THAT CONVERSATION IS NEXT, LIVE FROM NEW YORK, THIS IS

01:52:53 BLOOMBERG. ♪

01:53:22 JONATHAN: INFLATION DATA IS MOMENTS AWAY

01:53:23 AT 8:30 A.M. EASTERN TIME, ABOUT 14 MINUTES

01:53:26 AWAY. EQUITY FUTURES ARE NEGATIVE ONE

01:53:27 THIRD OF 1% ON THE S&P 500. THE CONCENTRATION RISK THIS

01:53:31 MORNING THREATENING THE RALLY.

01:53:36 >> NARROW LEADERSHIP EVEN IF IT CONTINUES IS NOT A HEALTHY

01:53:37 THING. AFTER ALL THIS TIME, THERE IS

01:53:41 STILL A TALE OF TWO CITIES WHERE MAKE A CAP TECH COMPANY

01:53:47 ARE THE ONES BEATING EXPECTATIONS AND GETTING RICHER

01:53:50 AND RICHER VALUATIONS, LEAVING THE MARKET HIGHER AND HIGHER.

01:53:55 IT'S MAKING THE S&P 500 AND GROWTH INDICES VERY

01:53:56 CONCENTRATED. JONATHAN: BANK OF AMERICA SAID INVESTORS

01:54:00 ARE LOADING UP ON BIG TECH. THE LATEST FUND MANAGER SURVEY

01:54:08 SAYS --

01:54:25 SARAH IS WITH US AROUND THE TABLE.

01:54:26 >> GOOD MORNING. JONATHAN: LET'S START WITH THE PERCEIVED

01:54:29 RISK. WHY IS NARROW CONCENTRATION IN

01:54:34 THE EQUITY MARKET NECESSARILY A BAD THING?

01:54:37 >> THERE HAVE BEEN TWO FACTORS DRIVING THE MARKET THIS YEAR

01:54:39 AND THAT'S EARNINGS AND THE ECONOMY.

01:54:41 IF YOU LOOK AT FOURTH-QUARTER EARNINGS, THEY BEEN HEAVILY

01:54:46 WEIGHTED TOWARD TECHNOLOGY STOCKS.

01:54:49 THE GROWTH IS ABOUT 60% ON THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN AND OVERALL

01:54:50 GROWTH SHOULD BE ABOUT 5% YEAR-OVER-YEAR.

01:54:55 WHAT IS THE CATALYST NOW THAT TECH STOCKS ARE BEHIND US WITH

01:54:56 THEIR EARNINGS. WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT IS

01:55:01 HIGHER FOR LONGER RATES, LESS RATE CUTS THEN THE MARKET

01:55:07 EXPECTS, HEAVY ELECTION YEAR AND 77 COUNTRIES WITH 60% OF

01:55:08 GDP GOING TO THE POLLS. THAT'S MORE HEADWINDS FOR THE

01:55:13 MARKET WHEN THE CATALYST IS TECHNOLOGY AND THE EARNINGS

01:55:15 GROWTH IS BEHIND US RIGHT NOW. JONATHAN:

01:55:18 YOUR YEAR AND CALL IS WHERE THE MARKET IS NOW?

01:55:19 >> DID IS. JONATHAN: DO YOU HAVE A PREFERENCE IN

01:55:25 TERMS OF SECTORS AT THE MOMENT BEYOND BIG TECH?

01:55:29 >> IT'S TOUGH TO THAT AGAINST U.S.

01:55:30 TECHNOLOGY BUT WE HAVE TO BE SELECTIVE SO COMPANY LIKE

01:55:34 AMAZON AND ALPHABET AND THE AI STOCKS ARE HYPED AND THEY

01:55:36 SHOULD BE THE WINNERS. WE THINK THE MARKET NEEDS TO

01:55:37 BROADEN OUT. WE ARE STARTING TO WARM UP ON

01:55:39 REAL ESTATE.

01:55:40 THE REITS TEND TO DO WELL IN AN AREA WHERE INTEREST RATES ARE

01:55:48 STABLE. ENERGY PRICES MIGHT CONTINUE TO

01:55:52 DECLINE IMMATERIAL SECTORS HAVE BEEN SQUEEZED TO PERFORM WELL

01:55:56 AND FIXED INCOME OVER EQUITIES, EQUITY VALUATIONS ARE AT A

01:55:59 PREMIUM, TRADING AT ABOUT 15% ABOVE THEIR AVERAGE.

01:56:02 FIXED INCOME LOOKS COMPELLING. LISA:

01:56:08 WHAT SCENARIO LEADS YOU TO AN UNDERPERFORMANCE ON THE INDEX

01:56:10 LEVEL BUT A BROADENING OUT WHICH REQUIRES ONGOING GROWTH

01:56:14 AND A RALLY IN FIXED INCOME WHICH -- WITH CUTS TO INTEREST

01:56:20 RATES? IS THIS A SOFT LANDING BASE

01:56:23 CASE YOU THINK WILL SOMEHOW HURT SOME OF THE BIGGEST

01:56:27 WINNERS?

01:56:28 >> TECHNICALS AND VALUATIONS ARE THE CONCERN IN EQUITIES.

01:56:33 VALUATIONS ARE ABOVE AVERAGE AND TECHNICALS ARE IN

01:56:35 OVERBOUGHT TERRITORY NOT ONLY FOR TECHNOLOGY BUT FOR THE S&P

01:56:36 IN GENERAL. THAT'S WHAT CONCERNS US WITH

01:56:41 THESE ADMINS GOING FORWARD. IN FIXED INCOME WITH THE CASH

01:56:45 STILL SITTING ON THE SIDELINES, WE THINK YOU CAN GET HIGHER

01:56:49 TOTAL RETURNS IN FIXED INCOME GOING FORWARD SO THE CASH

01:56:52 EVENTUALLY MOVES BACK INTO THE MARKET INTO LOWER RISK AREAS

01:56:54 LIKE EXTON COME WHERE YOU CAN REACH MORE AND GET MORE YIELD

01:56:55 IN YOUR INVESTMENTS. LISA: ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT LONGER

01:57:01 TERM TREASURIES OR INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT OR HIGHER YIELDS?

01:57:04 >> WE LIKE HIGH YIELD LEVERAGED LOANS.

01:57:08 WE ALSO LIKE HIGH YIELD WHERE YOU CAN GET MORE IN TERMS OF

01:57:11 RETURNS. IT'S A MUCH HIGHER QUALITY THAN

01:57:14 IT USED TO BE IN PAST ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS. JONATHAN:

01:57:18 WE HAVE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE.

01:57:22 WHAT ARE THE CONCERNS AROUND THAT FOR YOU?

01:57:25 IS THAT AN ISSUE THAT HITS A COUPLE OF BANKING NAMES AND NOT

01:57:29 EVERYBODY?

01:57:30 >> IF YOU LOOK AT NEW YORK COMMUNITY BANK, COMMERCIAL REAL

01:57:31 ESTATE IS AT A HIGHER PERCENTAGE FOR THEM THAN OTHER

01:57:34 BANKS. WE DON'T THINK THAT WILL TURN

01:57:37 INTO CONTAGION LIKE WE SAW LAST YEAR WITH SOME OF THE LARGER

01:57:43 AND REGIONAL BANKS.

01:57:44 ALSO WITHINREITS, COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE WITHIN THAT MARKET

01:57:47 IS LESS THAN 5% SO THERE AREAS YOU CAN INVEST IN WITHIN REAL

01:57:49 ESTATE TO AVOID IT. AT ANY TIME, YOU LOOK AT THESE

01:57:54 BANKS AND EVERYTHING IS DIGITAL AND YOU COULD GET A RUN ON

01:57:56 BANKS IN GENERAL BUT I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE A BROAD-BASED

01:57:58 COMMERCIAL IMPACT ON THESE REGIONAL BANKS. JONATHAN:

01:58:02 LET'S FINISH ON THE COME -- ON THE CONSUMER.

01:58:05 WE WILL GET RETAIL SALES IN A COUPLE OF DAYS SO HOW SQUEEZED

01:58:07 IS THE AMERICAN CONSUMER? WE'VE BEEN TOLD THAT REPEATEDLY

01:58:12 AND SEEMINGLY, THEY ARE STILL DOING OK.

01:58:14 >> WE GET RETAIL SALES THIS WEEK WHICH WERE STRONG.

01:58:17 THIS WEEK, WE WILL SEE A LITTLE BIT OF A MODERATION.

01:58:20 THE CONSUMER IS STILL SPENDING AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE

01:58:23 TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT CAME TO THE CONSUMER DURING THE

01:58:27 PANDEMIC AND THE GEAR OF LOW INTEREST RATES THROUGH THE

01:58:30 PANDEMIC. THE CONSUMER HANGOVER WILL

01:58:32 EVENTUALLY COME BUT WE ARE NOT SEEING SIGNS OF IT YET.

01:58:35 WITH INFLATION, THE CONCERN IS THAT THE FED SAYS THEY WANT TO

01:58:37 SEE BROADER DISINFLATION BEFORE THEY START TO CUT RATES.

01:58:41 I THINK WE WILL SEE DISINFLATION CONTINUE TO

01:58:45 MODERATE BUT IT'S CORE INFLATION, THE SERVICES

01:58:47 SPENDING, AUTO INSURANCE, IF THAT STARTS GOING UP, THAT'S

01:58:49 NOT GREAT FOR THE MARKET. JONATHAN:

01:58:51 LET'S GET A PREVIEW OF THE INFLATION NUMBER WITH MICHAEL

01:58:54 MCKEE. THE NUMBER IS EIGHT MINUTES

01:58:56 AWAY SO WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR? MIKE:

01:58:58 WE ARE LOOKING FOR IMPROVEMENT. THE MONTH OVER MONTH NUMBER FOR

01:59:04 DECEMBER WAS REVISED DOWN 0.2% LAST WEEK.

01:59:08 IT WOULD BE HARD TO SEE IT GOING BELOW THAT ON A MONTH

01:59:09 OVER MONTH BASIS. WE ARE EXPECTING THE HEADLINE

01:59:14 INFLATION NUMBER TO COME IN AT 2.9% WHICH BE THE -- WHICH

01:59:20 WOULD BE THE FIRST TIME SINCE 2001 THAT IT MANAGED TO FALL

01:59:25 BELOW 3%. ECONOMISTS SAY WHEN IT COMES TO

01:59:29 THE CORE RATE, IT STILL REMAINS STRONGLY ABOVE 3%.

01:59:33 THE ISSUE IS THE FED DOESN'T REALLY LOOK AT CPI OTHER THAN

01:59:36 AN INPUT INTO THEIR DISCUSSIONS. THEY WILL FOCUS ON THE PCE

01:59:39 REPORT LATER THIS MONTH. LISA: IN YOUR CONVERSATIONS WITH FED

01:59:46 OFFICIALS, HOW MUCH ARE THEY LOOKING PASS THIS TO RETAIL

01:59:47 SALES AND MORE JOBS DATA? THIS IS CONSIDERED BACKWARD

01:59:53 LOOKING SO WILL IT GIVE THEM WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR? MIKE:

01:59:56 THEY WILL TAKE THIS APART. CPI IS MUCH EASIER TO DISSECT

02:00:01 IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF CATEGORIES THAT IT MEASURES.

02:00:06 THEY CAN FIND OUT IF THEY ARE GETTING THAT BROUGHT

02:00:08 DISINFLATION, THEY HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT.

02:00:13 WE WILL LOOK AT THAT TO SEE WHAT KIND OF PROGRESS IS STILL

02:00:14 BEING MADE.

02:00:20 BY THEIR NATURE, THEY ARE BACKWARD LOOKING.

02:00:21 THE FED WANTS TO SEE CONTINUED PROGRESS.

02:00:25 JAY POWELL SAID WE DON'T NEED TO SEE BETTER PROGRESS, JUST

02:00:27 THE SAME KIND OF GOOD NEWS. JONATHAN:

02:00:32 MORE GOOD DATA, THANK YOU FOR BREAKING IT DOWN.

02:00:36 CAN WE WRAP IT UP WITH CPI? WHERE DO YOU EXPECT INFLATION

02:00:41 TO COME IN OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS ESPECIALLY WHEN THE

02:00:43 FED MOVES IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION?

02:00:46 >> WE WILL START TO SEE SOMEONE OF A DECLINE.

02:00:49 LOOKING AT THE NUMBER TODAY, MONTH OVER MONTH, IF IT COMES

02:00:52 CLOSER TO .4%, THAT WILL BE NEGATIVE FOR THE MARKETS.

02:00:58 IT COMES IN BELOW 2% MONTH OVER MONTH, YOU WILL SEE A LOWER

02:01:01 QUALITY RALLY AND PEOPLE PERHAPS WE'LL SEE RATE CUTS

02:01:03 SOONER. IN BETWEEN, WE WILL SEE MORE OF

02:01:05 THE SAME YEAR TO DATE.

02:01:11 WE WILL SEE HOW THE MARKETS REACT WHEN WE GET THE NUMBER.

02:01:14 JONATHAN: CONSUMER CONFIDENCE PICKS UP AS

02:01:17 WELL. WE WILL SEE IF IT HAS ANY EFFECT AT ALL.

02:01:22 LISA: SOMETHING HAD AN EFFECT ON THE

02:01:26 NEW YORK FEDERAL RESERVE THAT POINTED TO THE LOWEST THREE

02:01:28 YEAR OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION GOING BACK TO AT LEAST 2013.

02:01:31 SENTIMENT IS SHIFTING.

02:01:37 HOW MUCH ARE GASOLINE PRICES DIRECTLY CORRELATED.

02:01:41 YOU ARE SEEING THREE DOLLARS PER BARREL OIL.

02:01:48 JONATHAN: WASN'T THAT PART OF THE SURVEY?

02:01:53 LISA: IF YOU MAP OUT THE UNIVERSITY

02:01:54 OF MICHIGAN SENTIMENT SURVEY WITH THE PRICE OF GASOLINE, IT

02:01:58 JIBES PRETTY CLOSELY. JONATHAN: YOU CAN DO GREAT THINGS WITH

02:02:00 POLITICAL PARTIES. IT DEPENDS WHO IS IN THE WHITE

02:02:06 HOUSE AND THAT DEPENDS HOW HAPPY YOU ARE ON THE ECONOMY

02:02:07 WHICH IS RIDICULOUS. LISA: IT SPEAKS TO WHERE WE ARE AT

02:02:09 NOW. WE ARE IN A GREAT PLACE.

02:02:16 JONATHAN: WE CAN TALK ABOUT U.S. POLITICS IN THE YEAR AHEAD.

02:02:19 LISA: WE ARE AT A PIVOT POINT IN MANY

02:02:21 PLACES. I'M EXCITED TO DELVE UNDERNEATH

02:02:24 IT. IT'S A FASCINATING TIME, IRRITATING IN SOME WAYS.

02:02:32 JONATHAN: SARAH, THANK YOU. CPI DATA IS COMING UP NEXT.

02:02:39 OUR CHIEF ECONOMIST AT WELLS FARGO IS BREAKING IT DOWN.

02:02:42 INFLATION DATA'S AROUND THE COUNTRY AND EQUITY FUTURES ON

02:02:46 THE S&P 500 ARE LITTLE BIT SOFTER, DOWN 0.3%.

02:03:01 JONATHAN: INFLATION DATA AND AMERICA IS

02:03:02 ABOUT 20 SECONDS AWAY.

02:03:10 ON THE S&P 500, NEGATIVE BY 0.3 PERCENT AND ON THE NASDAQ, DOWN

02:03:12 ABOUT 0.7.

02:03:19 IN THE BOND MARKET, THE 10 YEAR IS 440 AND THE YIELDS DOWN

02:03:22 THREE BASIS POINTS ON THE TWO YEAR.

02:03:23 WE ARE DOWN THE BASIS POINTS THERE AS WELL.

02:03:26 LET'S GO OVER TO MICHAEL MCKEE. MIKE: GOOD MORNING.

02:03:34 THE GOOD NEWS DOESN'T NECESSARILY CONTINUE.

02:03:39 CPI IS UP 0.3% YEAR-OVER-YEAR. THAT PUTS US AT 3.1%.

02:03:45 THAT'S DOWN FROM 3.4 BUT IT'S NOT THE 2.9% THAT MANY PEOPLE

02:03:46 HAD HOPED FOR.

02:03:55 THE CORE RATE COMES IN AT ZERO POINT 4% RISE, HIGHER THAN THE

02:03:58 0.3% RISE ANTICIPATED. IT LEAVES CORE INFLATION AT

02:04:04 3.9% WHICH WAS THE SAME THAN A MONTH BEFORE.

02:04:07 YOU CAN TAKE THE SCORES AND I WILL LOOK AT THE BREAK DOWN AND

02:04:12 THE PROBLEM IS. JONATHAN: I'M SURE YOU CAN GUESS WHERE WE

02:04:16 ARE, WE ARE NEGATIVE ON THE S&P 500, DOWN BY 0.8%.

02:04:20 THE FIRST MOVE IS NOT ALWAYS THE RIGHT MOVE AFTER ECONOMIC

02:04:22 DATA. THE NASDAQ 100 IS NEGATIVE ON

02:04:24 THE BACK OF HOTTER THAN EXPECTED INFLATION WITH YIELDS

02:04:28 MUCH HIGHER. THEY WERE LOWER IN THE TWO-YEAR

02:04:31 IS HIGHER BY 10 BASIS POINTS.

02:04:40 YIELDS ARE UP ON THE LONGER END OF THE CURB BY SIX BASIS POINTS.

02:04:45 YOU PUSH THOSE MOVES THROUGH FOREIGN-EXCHANGE AND YOU GOT UP

02:04:46 STRONGER DOLLAR AND A WEAKER EURO.

02:04:53 YOU PUT THIS DATA TOGETHER WITH STRONG PAYROLLS PRINT AND

02:04:56 DECENT WAGE GROWTH WITH A DECENT ISM SERVICES AND YOU

02:05:01 START TO GET A LITTLE BIT MORE WORRIED ABOUT MAYBE THE FEDERAL

02:05:03 RESERVE NOT BEING ABLE TO CUT INTEREST RATES ANYTIME SOON.

02:05:07 I GO BACK TO THE QUOTE FROM STEWART KAISER AT CITIGROUP.

02:05:11 THE CPI PRINT AS THE POWER TO TOGGLE THE STORYLINE BETWEEN

02:05:15 SOFT LANDING AND OVERHEATING. HERE WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF

02:05:19 FEBRUARY AND THAT CONVERSATION IS NOT RUNNING AWAY WITH ITSELF

02:05:21 BUT IT'S HEATING UP A LITTLE BIT. LISA:

02:05:24 I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU SEE IN THE MARKET.

02:05:30 EARL DAVIS GETS A VICTORY LAP AFTER HE WAS TALKING ABOUT

02:05:31 SHORTING THE TWO-YEAR. THIS SEEMS TO EDIFY THAT.

02:05:35 THE KEY THING HERE IS IF YOU ARE NOT SEEING A BROADENING

02:05:39 OUT, HOW LONG DOES THE FED HAVE TO WAIT?

02:05:42 NOT ONLY IS THIS NOT AS GOOD DATA BUT IT KIND OF FLIES

02:05:46 AGAINST SOME OF THE PROGRESS WHICH IS THE REASON I'M CURIOUS.

02:05:53 I'M CURIOUS WHETHER WE WILL SEE AN ONGOING ACCEPTANCE OF

02:05:55 BROADENING OUT WITH THIS DATA EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT AS GOOD.

02:06:00 IT MEETS THE THRESHOLD FOR JAY POWELL OR DOES IT? JONATHAN:

02:06:04 DO YOU SEE THE BROADENING OUT? DO YOU SEE THE DISINFLATION

02:06:07 TREND? MIKE: WE BASICALLY SAY SOME OF THE

02:06:11 USUAL SUSPECTS HERE. OF THE BIGGEST REASONS WE SAW

02:06:16 CPI COME IN STRONGER THAN ANTICIPATED WAS HOUSING.

02:06:24 SHELTER COST WERE UP 0.6% AFTER 0.4% THE PRIOR MONTHS IN THE

02:06:26 SAME THING IS TRUE OF EQUIVALENT RENT.

02:06:29 HOME PRICES ARE STILL PUSHING UP AND RENT PRICES ARE STILL

02:06:30 PUSHING UP THE CPI. GASOLINE PRICES WENT DOWN 0.9%

02:06:36 SO THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS BUT FOOD PRICES WERE DOUBLE WHAT

02:06:38 THEY WERE THE MONTH BEFORE. FOOD IS SOMETHING THAT

02:06:47 CONSUMERS WILL NOTICE AND HOUSING IS PROPPING UP THE CPI

02:06:49 RATE HIGHER THAN THE FED WANTS TO SEE.

02:06:54 MANY OTHER THINGS ARE DOWN SOME LIKE APPAREL WHICH IS DOWN 0.1%

02:07:00 IN USED CARS AND TRUCKS WERE DOWN 0.7%.

02:07:07 WE ARE SEEING SOME PROGRESS -- SORRY, THEY ARE DOWN 3.4%.

02:07:12 WE ARE SEEING SOME PROGRESS IN THE AREAS THAT HAD GIVEN US

02:07:15 PROBLEMS IN THE PAST. THE BIG ONES ARE STILL CONTRIBUTING TO

02:07:16 CPI. LISA:

02:07:23 YOU LOOK AT THE MARKET RESPONSE AND PEOPLE HAVE EXPECTATIONS

02:07:24 FOR A MARCH RATE CUT. THERE IS A 17 PERCHANCE -- A

02:07:29 17% CHANCE BAKED IN. IS THIS IS BAD FOR THE FED AS

02:07:34 IT MAY SEEM IN TERMS OF MOVING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION?

02:07:37 DO YOU THINK THERE ARE ENOUGH SIGNS UNDERNEATH THE HOOD OF

02:07:39 SOME SORT OF BROADENING OUT THAT HE GIVES THEM COMFORT TO

02:07:43 CONTINUE WITH SOME OF THE SAME RHETORIC WE'VE
