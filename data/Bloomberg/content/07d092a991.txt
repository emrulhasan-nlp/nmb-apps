00:12 >> WE THINK THE FED IS IN A GOOD SPOT, WE DO THINK RED CUTS

00:13 ARE COMING.

00:16 >> THE FED IS EXPECTED TO START CUTTING.

00:20 >> IN MY MIND THAT ONLY HAPPENS IF REALLY BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO

00:23 THE ECONOMY.

00:27 >> IT LOOKS LIKE THE INFLATION BEAST HAS BEEN SLAIN.

00:31 >> THE NEAR TERM HERE, EVERYBODY SEEMS TO BE TOO HAPPY.

00:38 THE QUESTION WOULD BE WHAT MORE DOES THE FED NEED TO DO?

00:48 >> NO DOUBT ABOUT IT, AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE A BIG TOPIC OF

00:50 DISCUSSION IN 2024. VERY GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE.

00:55 THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE LIVE ON BLOOMBERG.

01:02 WE ARE IN FOR JOHN, TOM AND LISA WHO ARE GETTING A LITTLE

01:05 BIT OF A REST THIS WEEK, ALTHOUGH I GUESS THEY ARE

01:09 GETTING READY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE FED IS

01:13 GOING TO BE A BIG TOPIC. THIS IS ALL GOING TO BE AROUND.

01:18 >> IF YOU LOOK AT THAT LAST FLURRY INTO THE LAST FIVE DAYS

01:21 OF LAST WEEK BEFORE EVERYBODY EXITED, YOU HAD THIS MOMENTUM,

01:22 THE INFLATION DATA WAS GOOD. THE FINAL VICTORY MOMENT AROUND

01:27 FOR THE BULLS.

01:30 >> THE FED IS SAYING WE HAVE DONE IT.

01:35 >> I'VE GOT TO SAY, THE CHART THAT I ASSESSED WITH, YOU TAKE

01:41 A LOOK AT 10 YEAR YIELDS, WE ARE PRETTY MUCH RIGHT WHERE WE

01:44 STARTED THE YEAR, WHICH I THINK SPEAKS TO THE KIND OF YEAR

01:46 WE'VE HAD OVERALL. FEELS LIKE EVERYTHING WE WERE

01:48 TALKING ABOUT THIS TIME LAST YEAR WENT OUT THE WINDOW AND

01:51 GET AT THE MOVEMENT THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE BOND MARKET WITH

01:54 THE GUIDING EVERYTHING, WE ARE RIGHT WHERE WE STARTED.

01:58 >> BUT WHAT A LONG, STRANGE TRIP IT WAS.

02:01 BUT WE HAD TO GO THROUGH WHEN IT CAME TO THE BOND MARKET, FED

02:03 EXPECTATIONS. YOU DO WONDER WHETHER THINGS

02:07 START TO CALM DOWN A LITTLE BIT. >> THE OBSESSION WITH THE

02:11 RECESSION. THE RECESSION WHICH IS PROBABLY

02:15 A QUIET RECESSION BUT IT NEVER REALLY RIPPED US IN TERMS OF

02:18 THE UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS. I THINK THIS IS WHERE THE

02:23 NUANCES BEGIN TO PLAY OUT FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF NEXT YEAR.

02:26 POSITIONING IN THE BOND MARKET GOING INTO THIS.

02:31 CITIGROUP, BONDS ARE PULLING IT BACK.

02:34 BONDS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THE NIGHTMARE TRADE AGAIN. U.S.

02:39 BONDS DELIVERED AT 3% RETURN BUT POSITIONING IS EXTREME.

02:42 >> WITH SOME STOMACH TURNING VOLATILITY.

02:46 >> AND SOMETIMES IN A GIVEN DAY. >> 20 BASIS POINTS WINGS AND

02:49 THE SINGLE DAY FOR BONDS. WHEN IT COMES TO THE RECESSION,

02:54 THE PHRASE THAT I FOUND THAT I LIKE IS ROLLING RECESSION.

02:59 MAYBE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN ON AN ECONOMY-WIDE LEVEL BUT CERTAIN

03:00 INDUSTRIES CERTAINLY FELT THE PINCH.

03:06 >> MAYBE THAT IS WHY THE GOLDILOCKS ECONOMY, I TWEETED

03:07 OUT A PICTURE OF GOLDILOCKS AFTER THOSE INFLATION NUMBERS.

03:10 >> THE CARTOON CHARACTER?

03:13 >> YES, THANK YOU VERY MUCH WHATEVER.

03:17 POCKETS OF THE ECONOMY START TO SLOW DOWN BUT OTHER PARTS ARE

03:21 STRONG THAT MAY BE CREATED FOR GOLDILOCKS ECONOMY THAT MAY BE

03:23 THE FED WERE THE DOES ENGINEER THIS.

03:27 >> GAS PRICES ARE IMPORTANT, ALTHOUGH MORTGAGE RATES ARE THE

03:29 NEXT, THAT IS THE NEXT ISSUE.

03:35 IF THE FED DELIVERED THE 160 BASIS, WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? NEXT.

03:40 WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO TRIGGER 160 BASIS POINTS OF CUTS?

03:49 CAN YOU GET 160 BASIS POINTS OF CUTS WITHOUT SOMETHING MORE

03:50 AGGRESSIVE HAPPENING TO THE ECONOMY?

03:56 >> 75 BASIS POINTS, MAYBE THAT IS JUST GETTING BACK TO NEUTRAL.

04:01 150 OR 160, THAT FEELS LIKE A RECESSION.

04:08 >> I FEEL LIKE ALL OF LAST YEAR, WHEN WE FEEL LIKE WE

04:10 UNDERSTOOD THE NARRATIVE, SOMETHING HAPPENED.

04:15 I THINK ABOUT THE MIDDLE EAST. HEADLINES OVER THE WEEKEND.

04:19 IT IS A REMINDER WHEN WE THINK WE HAVE FIGURED OUT THIS MARKET

04:21 ENVIRONMENT SOMETHING HAPPENS THAT CHANGES THAT.

04:27 MANUS: THERE ARE TWO SET PIECES. ONE IS THE U.S.

04:30 STRIKING IN IRAQ. THE OTHER IS IN THE RED SEA AND

04:34 THE PASSAGE OF SHIPS. THERE WAS A TWEET IN TERMS OF

04:40 THE NUMBER OF SHIPS THAT HAVE DIVERTED FROM THE RED SEA IS

04:41 EVER 100. THE SECOND-BIGGEST CONTAINER

04:47 COMPANY IN THE WORLD ARE GOING BACK IN AND THEY ARE GOING BACK

04:50 IN WITH THE PROTECTION OF THE UNITED FORCES SET UP TO KEEP

04:52 THIS CHANNEL GLOBAL TRADE OPEN. OIL IS FAIRLY PHLEGMATIC WHEN

04:57 IT COMES TO ITS RESPONSE TO THIS NEWS FLOW.

05:01 >> WE HAVE A LOT TO GET TO. WE WANT TO GET TO THE MARKET

05:05 ENVIRONMENT. IT WILL BE QUIET TODAY.

05:11 IT WAS QUIET ON FRIDAY AHEAD OF THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY.

05:16 THE S&P 500 OFTEN EIGHT WEEK WINNING STREAK.

05:20 THE QUESTION IS DOES IT CONTINUE AS WE WRAP UP 2023.

05:25 S&P 500 FUTURES, UP .2%. THAT IS NOT A SURPRISE.

05:31 10 YEAR AT 3.88. HARD TO REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE

05:38 THINKING ABOUT 6% EARLIER THIS YEAR, CRUDE WATCHING THE ENERGY

05:40 MARKETS BECAUSE OF THE CONCERNS OUT OF THE MIDDLE EAST AND YOU

05:44 HAVE CRUDE QUIET THIS MORNING. KATIE:

05:50 IT HAS BEEN AMAZING TO WATCH CRUDE.

05:54 ALL OF THE HEADWINDS COMING TO THE MARKET BUT IT IS SUPPLY

05:55 DRIVEN MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

05:59 >> WE HAVE A LOT TO TALK ABOUT WITH THE MANAGING PORTFOLIO

06:01 MANAGER AT ANY CORA. HAPPY CHRISTMAS, MERRY

06:06 CHRISTMAS, HAPPY HOLIDAYS. SO GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE.

06:12 WE'LL BE WATCHING A LOT OF THE SAME THINGS IN 2024.

06:17 LET'S TALK 2023 IN THE RECENT RISK ON TRADE WE HAVE SEEN.

06:22 DOES IT MAKE SENSE QUESTION MEANT IS IT FUNDAMENTALLY

06:23 BACKED? DAVID: I THINK IT IS FUNDAMENTALLY

06:28 BACKED. COMPANIES ARE STILL GENERATING

06:32 ABOVE AVERAGE CASH FLOW MARGINS. EVALUATION ON A FREE CASH FLOW

06:38 BASIS STILL SELLS AT A REASONABLY ATTRACTIVE LEVEL.

06:42 THE MICRO IS A PRETTY GOOD BACKDROP.

06:45 AS YOU HAVE DISCUSSED THIS MORNING, MORE SIGNS THE FED

06:49 WILL BE FRIENDLIER IN 2024 FROM AN INTEREST-RATE PERSPECTIVE.

06:52 WE ARE ALREADY SEEING THE EFFECT WITH LONG BONDS DOWN 100

06:55 BASIS POINTS. THAT IS ACTING INDIRECTLY AS A

06:58 FED RATE CUT. MANUS: HAPPY HOLIDAYS.

07:05 YOU ARE THE BRAVE MEN WHO ANSWERED THE CALL AND SAID I

07:08 WILL GET UP AT 6:00.

07:14 THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS RUN-UP WE HAVE HAD IN RISK IN THE 10

07:19 YEAR PAPER, IN EQUITIES, IS EQUITIES AND BONDS ARE NOT

07:25 FULLY PRICED ON THE EXPECTATION OF 160 BASIS POINTS OF CUTS IN

07:28 THE ROAD IS ONE TO DISAPPOINTMENT.

07:34 ARE WE FULLY JUICED IN EQUITY AND BONDS OR IS THE ROAD AHEAD

07:38 GOING TO BE TRICKIER THAN WE PRESUME?

07:42 >> IT IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE TRICKIER.

07:47 THE RULE OF THUMB IS BETTER THE OVER OR BET THE UNDER.

07:53 THAT IS THE S&P RETURNS BETTER THAN 13% IN A CALENDAR YEAR OR

07:54 LESS THAN 6%. WE KNOW 2023 WAS A BIT THE OVER

08:00 YEAR AND I SUSPECT NEXT YEAR WILL BE A BET THE UNDER YEAR

08:05 FOR THE S&P 500 RETURNS LESS THAN 6%.

08:07 WHERE THE NEWS GETS BETTER IS THE AVERAGE STOCK IN THE S&P

08:11 500 CAN BE UP MEANINGFULLY BETTER THAN THAT BECAUSE THE

08:13 MICRO I REFERENCED. MARGINS ARE FAVORABLE.

08:20 VALUATIONS COME YOU COULD STILL FIND 150 OR BETTER STOCKS.

08:25 I THINK THEY TRADE AT AN ATTRACTIVE VALUATION.

08:29 >> THE ONE NARRATIVE THAT HAS COME THROUGH OVER LAST COUPLE

08:32 OF MONTHS HAS BEEN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY STUCK IN MONEY MARKET

08:33 FUNDS. $6 TRILLION IN TOTAL.

08:39 THE FLOW SHOW FROM BANK OF AMERICA SHOWED THAT.

08:42 YOU ALSO HAVE INSTITUTIONAL MONEY.

08:45 IS THAT WOULD PUTS THE FLOOR AND DELIVERS THE MINIMUM RETURN

08:49 YOU HAVE JUST DISCUSSED OR CAN THERE BE A WAVE, A NEW WAVE OF

08:54 CAPITAL DEPLOYED IN 2024 THAT WE ARE UNDER ASSUMING?

09:03 DAVID: DATA IS THE PLURAL OF ANECDOTE

09:07 AND ANECDOTALLY WE ARE SEEING MORE FUNDS FLOW INTO STOCK ETF,

09:11 PARTICULAR INTO THE SMALL-CAP CAP ASSET CLASS.

09:14 THAT WILL PLAY OUT NEXT YEAR SPECIFIC TO SMALL CAPS.

09:19 THE MEDIAN SMALL-CAP COMPANY WILL GROW ITS EARNINGS 8% TO 9%

09:21 NEXT YEAR. THAT IS AS GOOD AS WE WILL SEE

09:26 IN THE S&P 500 WENT THE SAME TIME SMALL CAPS ARE TRADING AT

09:30 THEIR BEST VALUATION ENTRY POINT SINCE EARLY 2001.

09:34 I THINK WE WILL SEE MORE MONEY INTO THE EQUITY MARKETS BECAUSE

09:40 THOSE YIELDS ARE GOING TO KEEP COMING DOWN FOR MONEY MARKETS.

09:44 KATIE: LET'S TALK MORE ABOUT MONEY

09:45 MARKETS. $6 TRILLION SITTING IN MONEY

09:48 MARKETS. A LOT OF THAT IN THE PAST

09:51 COUPLE OF YEARS. A CONVERSATION I HAVE BEEN

09:55 HAVING IS HOW MUCH OF THAT BELONGS TO RISK ASSETS, BELONGS

10:01 TO EQUITY MARKETS OR WHETHER OR NOT THAT HAS, AT THE EXPENSE OF

10:05 BANK DEPOSITS, WHETHER THAT IS STICKIER MONEY TYPICALLY IN

10:06 MONEY MARKET FUNDS. WHERE DO YOU FALL WHEN IT COMES

10:10 TO THE PROFILE OF THAT CASH? DAVID:

10:15 LET'S CALL IT ALL OF THE ABOVE.

10:22 SO MUCH OF THAT DID COME AFTER MARCH WHEN PEOPLE WERE WORRIED

10:25 ABOUT THE BANKS, BANKS WERE OFFERING YIELDS LESS THAN 1%.

10:29 THE SAVVY INVESTOR FOUND ITS WAY INTO SHORT-TERM PAPER THAT

10:34 WAS YIELDING BETTER THAN 5%. THAT WAS A GOOD STORY IN 2023.

10:43 FOR THE INVESTOR WANTS TO GET A BETTER INFLATION-ADJUSTED

10:46 AFTER-TAX RETURN IT WILL BE RIGHT BACK INTO THE

10:47 OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE U.S. EQUITY MARKET. KATIE:

10:51 LET'S TALK MORE ABOUT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES.

10:53 YOU'RE LOOKING AT SMALL CAPS. YOU HAVE SPECIFIC STOCKS.

11:02 ONLY FOUR ANALYST FOLLOW THIS STOCK AND APPARENTLY YOU DO.

11:06 WHAT DO YOU SEE IN THIS COMPANY? DAVID:

11:09 WITH THE BACKDROP BEING ONE OF THE BEST FORMULAS ARE BUYING

11:15 SPINOFFS, LOOK AT THE BLOOMBERG SPINOFF INDEX.

11:21 CRANE IS A SPINOFF OUT OF CRANE INDUSTRIAL COMPANY.

11:23 THEY MAKE CURRENCY. THEY OPERATE THE MACHINERY THAT

11:27 MAKES CURRENCY THAT ALLOWS FOR LACK OF FRAUD.

11:31 WE ARE SEEING CURRENCY STILL GROWING.

11:34 THAT IS WHERE BACKLOGS ARE UP 80%.

11:40 A UNDER FOLLOWED SPINOFF COMPANY HAS ALWAYS BEEN A GREAT

11:41 FORMULA. ON THE STAPLES SIDE, A SPINOFF

11:48 OUT OF KELLOGG'S, CHEESE ITS, PRINGLES, POP TARTS.

11:51 >> SO MUCH FOR HEALTHY EATING. [LAUGHTER] DAVID:

11:57 DAY AFTER CHRISTMAS. LET'S CALL IT IN MODERATION AS

12:02 WE GET ON THAT SCALE BUT THAT IS STILL A GROWTH AND A SPINOFF

12:04 FROM THE LARGER KELLOGG COMPANY. THAT IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A

12:07 GOOD FORMULA. AS SMALL CAPS DO BETTER, AS

12:13 WELL AS SOME SELECT LARGE CAPS, THERE IS A GOOD FORMULA.

12:18 >> I WAS LOOKING AT THE WEEKLY RETURNS LAST WEEK, SMALL CAPS

12:20 OUTPERFORMED. HAVING SAID THAT, YOU TALKED

12:26 WITH KATIE ABOUT CRANE NXT. IT IS UP 70% THIS YEAR.

12:32 YOU STILL MEET -- YOU STILL SEE MORE ROOM TO RUN BECAUSE THE

12:35 FUNDAMENTAL STORY BACKS IT. DAVID: ABSOLUTELY.

12:41 THE SIMPLE FACT THAT SMALL CAPS HAVE LAGGED MATERIALLY, WHETHER

12:46 IT IS CRANE OR OTHER SMALL CAPS, I THINK YOU WILL SEE MUCH

12:50 BETTER PERFORMANCE OUT OF SMALL CAPS IN 2024.

12:53 IT GOES BACK TO THEY HAVE NOT TRADED AT THIS TYPE OF VALUE

12:57 SINCE 2001.

13:03 I THINK IT IS A GOOD COMPLEMENT TO LARGE-CAP ALLOCATION.

13:08 >> YOU ARE CERTAINLY A FRIEND TO BLOOMBERG.

13:10 WE WISH YOU A HAPPY YEAR. TALK ABOUT THE BROADENING OUT

13:14 OF THE RALLY WE HAVE SEEN. DAVID SOUTHERLY JOINING US.

13:22 I WONDER IF WE GET ANOTHER YEAR WHERE EVERYBODY PUSHES BACK

13:24 AGAINST GROWTH, PUSHES BACK AGAINST BUYING THE INDEX AND

13:28 THAT IS WHERE WE SEE THE GATES GAINING? KATIE:

13:33 IT SEEMS LIKE THAT WAS THE STORY OF 2023.

13:36 WE HAVE HAD A FANTASTIC BROADENING SINCE LATE APRIL.

13:40 WE DO HAVE A FRIENDLIER FED, WHETHER THAT IS ENOUGH, WE WILL

13:42 FIND OUT. MANUS: I THINK WE WILL ALL SUFFER FROM

13:46 THAT FOAM OH. -- FROM THAT FOMO. THERE WAS NOT ANY BREADTH IN

13:51 THAT EQUITY RALLY. IT WAS A WAR OF MONEY.

13:58 THE QUESTION IS HOW SUPPORTED IS AT BY THE INSTITUTIONS OR IS

14:00 IT ALL FAST MONEY?

14:05 >> I WONDER AT A NAME LIKE APPLE , COMING OUT AND SAYING

14:08 APPLE DID INFRINGE ON TWO PATENTS HALTING THE APPLE WATCH

14:11 SALE. HOW DOES THAT AFFECT SOME OF

14:14 THESE GROWTH STORIES? MANUS: JAPAN WILL ALSO RATE IN APPLE

14:17 AND GOOGLE. A LOT OF TEXT CONVERSATIONS

14:21 OVER THE NEXT THREE HOURS.

14:27 >> COMING UP AT 7:00, TOM TZITZOURIS OF STRATEGAS.

14:30 YOU'RE WATCHING AND LISTENING TO BLOOMBERG.

14:45 >> IF YOU LOOK BACK OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR, IT IS

14:49 STUNNING HOW MUCH PROGRESS THE ECONOMY HAS MADE.

14:56 INFLATION HAS COME DOWN FASTER THAN THE OPTIMISTIC FORECASTS

14:58 AND GROWTH HAS REMAIN RESILIENT ALONG WITH THE STRONG

14:59 EMPLOYMENT. ONE YEAR AGO THE CONSENSUS

15:05 PROJECTION WAS GETTING INFLATION DOWN WOULD REQUIRE A

15:07 SPIKE IN UNEMPLOYMENT AND A RECESSION.

15:12 >> THAT WAS LAEL BRAINARD SPEAKING ON FRIDAY.

15:15 WELCOME BACK TO BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE.

15:17 CAROL NASSER ALONG WITH KATIE GREIFELD AND MINNIS QUINNEY --

15:22 AND MINNIS CRANEY. I WONDER EVEN WITH THAT

15:26 ECONOMIC BACKDROP HOW THAT HELPS OR HURTS WHEN IT COMES TO

15:30 THE NOVEMBER PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. KATIE:

15:37 WHEN IT COMES TO JOE BIDEN THE BUGABOO HAS BEEN HE CANNOT GET

15:41 PEOPLE EXCITED AND ENGAGED WITH BIDENOMICS.

15:44 MADE OF GROWTH HAS GONE DOWN DRAMATICALLY.

15:48 OVERALL PRICES ARE SUPER HIGH COMPARED TO WHERE WE WERE A

15:49 COUPLE YEARS AGO. MANUS: FROM THE OTHER SIDE YOU WILL

15:57 HAVE THIS LAMBASTING OF BIDENOMICS AND THE INFLATION

15:58 NARRATIVE. WILL HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF

16:02 POLITICIZATION OF THE FED. WE WILL GO INTO AN ELECTION

16:04 YEAR. MOHAMED EL-ERIAN HAS PARADED

16:11 THE COMMUNICATION FROM THE FED AND SAYS THE FED HAS BEEN

16:13 BACKED INTO A CORNER. AND THERE WILL BE A DEBATE ON

16:16 IF AND WHEN THEY PULL THE TRIGGER ON RATE CUTS.

16:19 HOW POLITICIZED ARE THOSE RATE CUTS.

16:29 THAT WILL BE PART OF THE ZEITGEIST OF 2024. CAROL:

16:34 WHERE ARE WE ON THIS TUESDAY? EXPECTED TO BE A QUIET DAY AND

16:38 A QUIET WEEK. MARKETS OVERSEAS ARE CLOSED.

16:46 S&P 500 FUTURES, 4011 WE ARE LOOKING AT, UP .1%.

16:53 YOU HAVE THE 10 YEAR, 3.87.

17:00 KATIE: JUST PUT IT IN CEMENT. IT IS SHOCKING TO SEE WHERE WE

17:03 ARE. CAROL: NEW YORK CRUDE LOWER.

17:09 I MENTIONED POLITICS AND THAT WILL BE ON EVERYONE'S MIND.

17:12 MATTHEW BARTLETT IS THE PRINCIPAL AT DERBY FIELD

17:16 ADVISORS AND HAS WORKED ON POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS FOR THE GOP.

17:19 GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE. WE HAVE A PRIMARY IN JANUARY.

17:25 WE ARE THINKING ABOUT -- LET'S TALK ABOUT THE REPUBLICANS.

17:29 IS IT A LOCK FOR DONALD TRUMP OR DO YOU CONSIDER SOME OF THE

17:36 OTHER PLAYERS? DAVID:

17:37 GOOD MORNING -- MATTHEW: GOOD MORNING.

17:43 YOU SAID IT BEST. THIS RACE HAS BEEN PLAYING OUT IN NEW

17:44 HAMPSHIRE FOR MORE THAN A YEAR. AS IT GETS COLDER AND WE GET

17:48 TOWARDS THE NEW YEAR THERE IS A CHANCE FOR VOLATILITY.

17:50 THIS IS PRIME FOR DISRUPTION AND YOU HAVE PLAYERS THAT HAVE

17:53 BEEN OUT THERE. NIKKI HALEY HAS BEEN WORKING

17:56 HARD.

18:02 RON DESANTIS HAS BEEN GETTING ACTIVIST ATTENTION BUT DONALD

18:03 TRUMP CONTINUES TO BE A DOMINANT FORCE AND WILL BE

18:06 UNTIL HE MIGHT NOT BE. MANUS: I WAS QUITE SURPRISED WHEN I

18:12 WAS READING THROUGH YOUR NOTES.

18:18 YOU SAY TRUMP IS AT 50%, NOT 80% , AND HE SHOULD BE MORE

18:19 SIGNIFICANTLY AHEAD. WHAT DOES THAT DO?

18:27 ARE WE ARE -- ARE WE ALL MYOPICALLY ABSORBING THE MEDIA

18:28 SAYING THERE IS NO OPTION TO TRUMP OR DOES THIS PRIMARY

18:32 ALLOW US TO UNDERSTAND WHERE NIKKI HALEY AND RON DESANTIS IT

18:35 AND HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO CHALLENGE? MATTHEW:

18:38 EXCELLENT POINT. THIS IS NOT A NATIONAL RACE FOR

18:42 PRESIDENT, THESE ARE STATE-BY-STATE CONTEST. IOWA,

18:46 WE'VE SEEN ACTIVITY, THEN NEW HAMPSHIRE.

18:49 AFTER NEW HAMPSHIRE IS NEVADA AND SOUTH CAROLINA.

18:53 WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE POLLS IN THE EARLY STATES AS

18:56 OPPOSED TO THE NATIONAL POLLS. THE NATIONAL POLLS TEND TO BE

19:00 LAGGING AND MAYBE THE EARLY STATE POLLS ARE AN INDICATOR

19:01 PULL. NEW HAMPSHIRE, DONALD TRUMP,

19:08 THE FORMER PRESIDENT, THE POLITICAL IDENTITY FOR MUCH OF

19:09 THE REPUBLICAN BASE FOR THE BETTER PART OF A DECADE, HE IS

19:13 PULLING UNDER 50%. THAT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

19:16 SOMEONE TO COME OUT AND CHALLENGE HIM FOR THE

19:17 NOMINATION. RIGHT NOW THAT PERSON IS NIKKI

19:21 HALEY. SHE HAS THE ENDORSEMENT OF THE

19:25 VERY POPULAR GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU.

19:30 NEW HAMPSHIRE IS A PURPLE STATE, IT IS A SWING STATE, A

19:33 DEMOCRATIC DELEGATION AND A VERY POPULAR REPUBLICAN

19:35 GOVERNOR. SHE EARNED HIS ADORE CEMENT

19:41 THAT HAS HELPED CATAPULT HER TO THE STRATOSPHERE WHERE THIS

19:42 COULD BE A COMPETITIVE RACE. KATIE:

19:47 LET'S TALK ABOUT ONE SPECIFIC POLE, THE DECEMBER 21 RELEASED

19:50 BY THE AMERICAN RESEARCH GROUP. THAT CAUGHT A LOT OF ATTENTION

19:54 SINCE IT SHOWED NIKKI HALEY WAS FOUR POINTS BEHIND DONALD TRUMP

19:58 AT 29%. TRUMP AT 33%. TRUMP CALLED APPLE FAKE NEWS.

20:07 WHEN YOU -- TRUMP CALLED THAT FAKE NEWS.

20:09 WHEN IT COMES TO NEW HAMPSHIRE, HOW CLOSE IS THE GAP? MATTHEW:

20:12 UNCLEAR.

20:18 POLLS SHOW MOMENTUM AND INDICATE MOVEMENT AROUND A

20:19 CAMPAIGN AND A CANDIDATE. AS YOU SAID, THIS RACE WILL GET

20:25 MUCH MORE REAL AFTER THE NEW YEAR WHEN VOTERS PAY ATTENTION,

20:29 WHEN THERE IS THE REAL VOLATILITY AS WE SEE IN THE

20:30 MARKETS ALMOST EVERY DAY. YOU WILL SEE THAT IN NEW

20:34 HAMPSHIRE AND IOWA AND THAT IS WHERE NIKKI HALEY IT APPEARS IS

20:41 IN A POSITION TO CAPTURE THE ATTENTION OF THE PARTY STARTING

20:45 IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND POSSIBLY DOWN TO SOUTH CAROLINA AND

20:49 MAKING THIS MUCH MORE OF A NATIONAL RACE MOVING FORWARD.

20:52 CAROL: YOU RESIGNED IN PROTEST FROM

20:53 THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT. YOU ARE APPOINTED BY DONALD

20:56 TRUMP. WHAT WOULD ANOTHER TRUMP WHITE

21:00 HOUSE MEAN FOR AMERICANS AND THE UNITED STATES?

21:05 YOU THINK HAVING A SECOND TERM FOR DONALD TRUMP IS A GOOD

21:08 THING FOR UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, AND ODDLY ITS ROLE

21:10 HERE DOMESTICALLY BUT ON THE GLOBAL STAGE AND SOME MID-LEVEL

21:12 THINGS GOING ON? MATTHEW: THAT IS A HARD ONE.

21:20 I RESIGNED JANUARY 6. VERY HARD DAY IN THIS TOWN.

21:24 VERY EASY DECISION IN MY LIFE. MOVING FORWARD I KNOW THERE ARE

21:28 MANY PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT HAVE FRUSTRATIONS, WHETHER

21:33 IT IS ECONOMICALLY, WHETHER IT IS GLOBALLY.

21:38 IN TERMS OF A SECOND DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENCY, I THINK MOST

21:42 PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE LOOKING AT BETTER OPTIONS IN

21:44 THIS COUNTRY, WHETHER IT IS REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT.

21:49 IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLLING, IT APPEARS DONALD TRUMP AND

21:54 POTENTIALLY JOE BIDEN ARE ON COURSE TO GET THEIR OWN

21:57 NOMINATIONS AND IT APPEARS THE COUNTRY WANTS A DIFFERENT

21:58 OPTION. THAT IS WHY THIS RACE IS SO

22:04 PRIME FOR DISRUPTION AND IT IS POSSIBLE IT STARTS IN NEW

22:05 HAMPSHIRE. WHERE IT GOES THEN WILL BE UP

22:07 TO THE VOTERS. MANUS: I AM CURIOUS TO GET YOUR TAKE.

22:12 LET ME READ YOU WHAT LINDSEY GRAHAM SAID ABOUT THE COLOR IN

22:17 A RULING. "IT IS CHILLING TO MEET, IT

22:21 WOULD SET UP A POLITICIZATION OF THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE AND BE

22:22 BAD FOR THE COUNTRY."

22:24 LET'S WORK ON THE ASSUMPTION THE SUPREME COURT FINDS IN

22:29 FAVOR OF TRUMP. AS COLORADO EMBOLDENED THE

22:33 TRUMP BASE? MATTHEW: ABSOLUTELY. WHAT DID THEY DO BETTER THAN

22:40 ANY OTHER CAMPAIGN OR CANDIDATE IN HISTORY? PLAY THE VICTIM.

22:48 MANIPULATE A SITUATION WHERE IT IS COMPLETELY BECAUSE OF HIS

22:52 OWN ACTIONS, BECAUSE OF THE CHOICES AND DECISIONS HE HAS

22:57 UNDERTAKEN, WHETHER AS PRESIDENT OR TO TRY TO REMAIN

22:59 AS PRESIDENT, AND THEN TO PLAY THE VICTIM CARD.

23:06 IT IS UNBELIEVABLE AND UNFORTUNATE THAT IN THIS CASE

23:12 YOU HAD A COURT RULING WHICH MOST EXPERTS BELIEVE THIS WILL

23:13 BE OVERTURNED.

23:19 THE SUPERCHARGING OF THE BASE, THE GRIEVANCES, YOU ARE THE

23:21 VICTIM, THIS DOES NOTHING BUT PLAY INTO THAT.

23:26 WE SEE AS THINGS TURN THE CORNER AS THIS RACE GET SERIOUS

23:29 AND THERE ARE MANY BETTER OPTIONS PRESENTED. CAROL:

23:32 30 SECONDS. HIS DONALD TRUMP CONTROLLING

23:37 THE PURSE STRINGS THE GOP PARTY? MATTHEW: YES.

23:43 THERE IS THE WHOLE CONSULTANT CLASS.

23:47 HE HAS BEEN IN A FIGHT WITH TED CRUZ'S CONSULTANT JEFF WROTE

23:50 AND THEY'VE GONE BACK AND FORTH AS TO WHO SHOULD BE IN CHARGE

23:52 OF SENATE RACES GOING FORWARD. HE IS THE BIG DOG, THE FORMER

23:56 PRESIDENT. THAT COMES NOT WITH SUPPORT

24:01 FROM THE BASE, BUT INFLUENCE IN THIS TOWN, WHETHER IT IS DEBT

24:06 CEILING NEGOTIATIONS, SHUT NEGOTIATIONS, THE NEW SPEAKER,

24:09 AS WELL AS RACES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. CAROL:

24:11 THANK YOU SO MUCH. MATTHEW BARTLETT.

24:15 I COULD TALK ALL DAY ABOUT POLITICS. MANUS:

24:19 YOU HAVE ALL OF 2024 TO DO IT. CAROL:

24:26 WILL ALSO BE TALKING A LOT ABOUT BIG TECH.

24:31 COMING UP, DAN IVES OF WEDBUSH. HE LIKES APPLE A LITTLE BIT.

24:52 CAROL: GOOD MORNING. THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE.

24:59 WE ARE IN FOR JOHN, TOM, AN D LISA.

25:03 IT WILL BE THE FINAL TRADING WEEK OF 2023. YAY. KATIE:

25:07 WE DID IT. CAROL: S&P 500 FUTURES UP .1%.

25:16 MARKETS CLOSED OVERSEAS. NASDAQ 100 FUTURES THE UPPER

25:20 FORMER, UP 1% LAST WEEK. NASDAQ FUTURES UP .2%.

25:27 RUSSELL 2000, THE UPPER FORMER LAST WEEK. UP 2.5%.

25:32 OUTPERFORMING. IT IS LIKE INVESTORS GOT THE

25:35 MEMO. KATIE: IT FEELS LIKE YOU ARE STILL

25:40 SEEING BIG MOVES WHEN IT COMES TO SMALL CAPS.

25:43 QUIET BUT VERY CONSISTENT. CAROL: TREASURIES CONSISTENT.

25:50 IT FEELS LIKE THEY HAVE SETTLED DOWN. FINGERS AND TOES CROSSED.

25:53 U.S. TWO YEAR, JUST UP HERE.

26:01 THE THIRTY-YEAR, LET'S FLIP IT OVER TO THE CURRENCY MARKET.

26:05 WE ARE LOOKING AT THE EURO VERSUS THE U.S. GREENBACK.

26:08 YOU CAN SHE JUST UP SLIGHTLY. I WAS JUST IN EUROPE.

26:16 THAT IS YOUR MARKET SET UP ON THIS TUESDAY.

26:19 LET'S GET TO WHAT IS IN SOME OF THE HEADLINES ON THIS TUESDAY.

26:24 A SERIOUS ONE AND A REMINDER OF THE TENSIONS OVERSEAS. THE U.S.

26:28 LAUNCHING STRIKES ON THREE INSTALLATIONS IN IRAQ,

26:35 TARGETING AN IRAN BACKED TERRORIST GROUP ACCUSED OF

26:36 ATTACKS ON AMERICAN PERSONNEL. USA IN THE STRIKE DESTROYED THE

26:40 TARGETED FACILITIES. IRAQ CONDEMNED THE STRIPES.

26:45 A MEMBER OF THE COUNTRY'S ARMED FORCES WAS KILLED.

26:50 THIS IS A REMINDER THAT THIS IS SOMETHING WE WILL BE DEALING

26:55 WITH IN 2024, EVEN THOUGH THERE IS SO MUCH PRESSURE TO PUT AN

26:56 END TO THIS WAR. MANUS:

27:02 THIS IS EVERYTHING THE UNITED STATES AND THE REST OF THE

27:03 COALITION OF THE WEST DO NOT WANT TO SEEK WHICH IS AN

27:07 EXPANSION OF THIS CONFLICT WHICH IS THE HAMAS-ISRAEL WAR,

27:12 MATERIAL BEYOND BORDERS, WHETHER IT IS LEBANON AND

27:15 HEZBOLLAH OR IN THIS CASE, DEALING WITH IRAQ.

27:20 IT IS A WIDENING OF THE CONFLAGRATION AND THAT IS NOT

27:22 WITH THIS WHITE HOUSE WANT TO SEE.

27:25 LET'S SEE WHERE THE WRITER GOES IN TERMS OF DE-ESCALATION.

27:28 IT DOES NOT SEEM AS IF WE ARE ENDING CLOSER TO THAT FROM THAT

27:31 YAHOO!. -- FROM BENJAMIN NETANYAHU.

27:37 CAROL: CHINA SOFTENING ITS STANCE ON

27:38 GAMING. THE BACK-AND-FORTH OF CHINESE

27:45 POLICY ONE WEEK AFTER MOVES TO TIGHT RESTRICTIONS LED TO AN

27:46 $80 BILLION ROUTE. THE COUNTRY APPROVING 105

27:50 DOMESTIC GAMES. TWO OF THE COMPANY'S HARDEST

27:54 HIT BY BEIJING'S NEW RULES. LAST WEEK CHINA'S TOP GAMING

27:59 REGULATOR ANNOUNCED NEW RULES TO LIMIT THE DEVELOPING OF

28:01 ONLINE GAMES, INCLUDING HER CAPS ON SPENDING BY PLAYERS.

28:06 THIS IS THE BACK-AND-FORTH IN TERMS OF INVESTORS TRY TO

28:09 FIGURE OUT WHERE CHINA LIES, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO

28:11 PUBLICLY TRADED ENTITIES IN THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT. KATIE:

28:18 WHEN NEWS CAME DOWN LAST WEEK COME THE QUESTION WAS WAS THIS

28:21 ANOTHER 2021 EPISODE? YOU TALK ABOUT THE

28:24 BACK-AND-FORTH WHEN IT COMES TO POLICY.

28:27 OBVIOUSLY IT ERODES THAT. YOU'VE SEEN THAT IN THE

28:30 PERFORMANCE THIS YEAR. IT HAS BEEN A GREAT YEAR FOR EM

28:34 OVERALL. EM EX CHINA, AND THAT IT LOOKS

28:39 LIKE EM DID NOT WORK OUT. CAROL: ALWAYS SEEMS LIKE IT'S OWN

28:42 STORY. WE HAVE SOMETHING MORE FUN.

28:49 SHARES OF MANCHESTER UNITED RISING AFTER BILLIONAIRE JIM

28:52 RADCLIFFE COMPLETED HIS PURCHASE OF A STAKE IN THE

28:53 ENGLISH FOOTBALL CLUB. PLAYING $1.3 BILLION FOR A 25%

28:59 STAKE IN THE CLUB AND SAYING OUR SHARED AMBITION IS CLEAR.

29:03 WE WANT TO SEE MANCHESTER UNITED BACK WHERE WE BELONG AT

29:05 THE TOP OF ENGLISH IN WORLD FOOTBALL.

29:09 HAVING JUST WATCHED BACK I FEEL

29:12 LIKE -- HAVING JUST WATCHED B ECKHAM I FEEL LIKE I AM AN

29:17 EXPERT. MANUS: I THINK IT IS THE BAD BLOOD

29:21 BETWEEN THE QATARIS. THE QATARIS LOST OUT.

29:30 EVERYONE THOUGHT THE QATARIS WOULD PLAY $6 BILLION.

29:34 JIM RADCLIFFE IS A BRIDGE INSTITUTION.

29:38 HE HAS PUT $300 BILLION INTO MANCHESTER UNITED AND HE GETS

29:40 TWO SEATS ON THE BOARD. I IMAGINE FROM THE FAN POINT OF

29:44 VIEW, BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF ANGST IN BRITISH FOOTBALL IN

29:48 TERMS OF WHO INVEST AND WHO OWNS THESE FOOTBALL CLUBS AND

29:50 WHERE THEY ARE GOING. MANCHESTER UNITED FANS ARE A

29:53 SPECIAL GROUP. I KNOW THEM WELL. KATIE:

29:59 DIDN'T RADCLIFFE TRY TO BUY CHELSEA?

30:02 HE SEEMS LIKE A MAN WHO WANTS TO BUY THINGS. CAROL:

30:05 A BILLIONAIRE WHO LIKES SPORTS? WHEN DOES THAT EVER HAPPEN?

30:10 MANUS: THAT REMINDS YOU OF THE WHOLE

30:11 OF SAUDI ARABIA. [LAUGHTER] MANUS:

30:16 GOOGLE AND AMAZON HAVE HAD YEARS WHERE THERE PROMISING THE

30:21 FUTURE WILL BE FILLED WITH PACKAGE DELIVERIES FALLING

30:24 SAFELY FROM THE SKY. ZIP LINE MIGHT BE THE FIRST TO

30:28 MAKE THAT FUTURE A POSSIBILITY. EMILY CHANG LOOKS OF THE

30:32 POTENTIAL OF DRONE DELIVERIES READY FOR TAKEOFF.

30:36 >> SO MANY TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES ARE TRYING TO SOLVE PROBLEMS

30:40 FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN A FEW SPECIFIC CITIES OF THIS

30:42 PARTICULAR COUNTRY. IN REALITY BUILDING THE FUTURE

30:45 WE WANT OR WE WOULD BE PROUD TO HAND TO OUR KIDS INVOLVES

30:49 HUMANITY SOLVING PROBLEMS AT GLOBAL SCALE.

31:04 >> THIS IS ZIPLINE DRONE DELIVERY, THE STARTUP FOUNDED

31:06 IN 2014 HELP BUILD HYPE FOR A FUTURE FILLED WITH PACKAGES

31:09 FALLING CONVENIENTLY FROM THE SKY.

31:11 AS THAT FUTURE BECOMES MORE OF A REALITY ZIPLINE WILL HAVE TO

31:14 COMPETE WITH THE LIKES OF AMAZON PRIME AIR.

31:19 REMEMBER WHEN JEFF BEZOS UNVEILED A OPTOCOPTER ON 60

31:22 MINUTES? THAT WAS A DECADE AGO.

31:30 AMAZON IS MAKING SLOW PROGRESS AND ALPHABETS WEIGHING IS

31:31 GETTING OFF THE GROUND AS WELL.

31:38 >> THANK YOU FOR COMING. WE SERVE EIGHT COUNTRIES.

31:45 WE SERVE 3500 HOSPITALS AND HEALTH FACILITIES GLOBALLY.

31:50 EMILY: ZIPLINE HONED ITS TECHNOLOGY IN

31:53 RWANDA, DELIVERING BLOOD IN VACCINES AND MEDICAL SUPPLIES,

31:56 ESPECIALLY TO RURAL AREAS PREVIOUSLY POORLY SERVED BY

31:58 LAND. DOES THAT GIVE YOU CHILLS YOU

32:01 ARE SAVING LIVES? EMILY: IT NEVER GETS OLD -- >> IT

32:07 NEVER GETS OLD. IT HAS BEEN COOL TO SEE THE

32:09 SYSTEM SCALE. EMILY: CAN YOU SHOW US HOW THE MAGIC

32:13 HAPPENS?

32:16 >> LET'S DO IT. THIS IS ZIPLINE'S MAIN

32:21 MANUFACTURING AREA. ZIPLINE HAS TWO PRODUCTS.

32:27 PLATFORM ONE IS FOCUSED ON ENTERPRISE DELIVERY.

32:31 PLATFORM TWO IS LAUNCHING WITH CUSTOMERS IN A FEW MONTHS.

32:34 WE ARE A FULL COMPANY. WE ARE BUILDING LINE

32:39 REPLACEABLE UNITS, THE ASSEMBLIES OF THE AIRCRAFT.

32:41 IT ALL HAPPENS HERE. YOU CAN THINK OF THIS AS THE

32:45 EARS OF THE AIRCRAFT. WE ARE PASSING A HUGE AMOUNT OF

32:49 AIR THROUGH HERE. IF WE ARE ENCOUNTERING SUCH

32:55 INSANE WEATHER CONDITIONS OR THERE IS SYSTEMATIC FAILURE

32:58 THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE ACROSS MULTIPLE LEVELS, WE WILL DEPLOY

33:01 THE PARACHUTE SO WE CAN BRING THE AIRCRAFT GENTLY TO THE

33:02 GROUND. THIS IS THE REASON ZIPLINE HAS

33:07 HAD ZERO HUMAN SAFETY INCIDENTS. YOU WILL LIE THESE UP WITH

33:10 THOSE. EMILY: NOT HEAVY AT ALL.

33:22 >> THIS IS THE ADVANTAGE OF CARBON FIBER MATERIALS.

33:24 YOU CAN DESIGN SOMETHING THAT IS STRONG DESIGNED TO GO UP TO

33:31 # 3G'S OF LOAD. WHERE WE ARE NOW WE CALL NESTA

33:37 ZERO, THIS IS THE FIRST TEST SITE.

33:44 >> WHEN WE STARTED BUILDING ZIPLINE, THE MORE WE THOUGHT

33:47 ABOUT LOGISTICS THE MORE WE REALIZED GLOBAL LOGISTICS ONLY

33:50 DOES A JOB SERVING PEOPLE IN THE RICHEST BILLION PEOPLE ON

33:52 EARTH. YOUR ACCESS IS PROBABLY OK.

33:57 FOR THE 7 BILLION PEOPLE WHO DO NOT FALL INTO THAT CATEGORY.

34:10 5.5 MILLION WHAT IS EXCITING TO US ABOUT BILLY AGAIN AUTOMATED

34:13 LOGISTIC SYSTEM IS IT WILL BE THE FIRST LOGISTIC SYSTEM THAT

34:16 SERVES ALL PEOPLE EQUALLY.

34:26 EMILY: VISIT THE GOAL TO BE A MODERN

34:30 DAY UPS OR FEDEX OR IS THIS SOMETHING BIGGER?

34:35 >> THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD A SYSTEM 10 TIMES FASTER AT HALF

34:39 THE COST, ZERO EMISSIONS, AND BROADLY AVAILABLE TO EVERY

34:45 HUMAN ON EARTH IS 10 TIMES OR LARGER.

34:52 I STARTED -- >> I STARTED AT ZIPLINE A FEW MONTHS.

34:57 >> MEMBERS OF THE ROLANDO AND GONE AND FLIGHT OPERATIONS

34:58 HAVING TO TRAIN ALL OF OUR U.S. MEMBERS ON HOW TO DO THIS AT

35:01 SCALE.

35:20 EMILY: AT IS AMAZING. -- THAT IS AMAZING.

35:31 > T-SHIRTS. SO PREPARED.

35:37 IS THE GOAL TO DELIVER EVERYTHING FROM BLOOD TO

35:38 VACCINES TO KLEENEX AND SUSHI?

35:42 >> IT TURNS OUT OUR CUSTOMERS WANT EVERYTHING.

35:46 A GOOD ANALOGY IS WITH WALMART WE PLAN TO LAUNCH AROUND THEIR

35:47 PHARMACY BUSINESS. THEY ARE ONE OF THE LARGEST

35:50 PHARMACIES IN THE U.S.. RAPIDLY IT WAS CLEAR CUSTOMERS

35:54 WANTED TO ORDER EVERYTHING.

36:00 TODAY WE DELIVER 24,000 OF THE 29,000 SKU S IN THE STORE WE

36:04 ARE ATTACHED TO. EMILY: YOU HAVE COMPETITION.

36:11 >> THERE ARE A LOT OF BIG COMPANIES WITH INFINITE

36:12 RESOURCES TALKING ABOUT THIS MARKET.

36:15 TALK AND WALK OR DIFFERENT THINGS.

36:18 WE'RE THE LARGEST COMMERCIAL ECONOMIST SYSTEM ON EARTH.

36:26 EMILY: COMPARED TO AMAZON?

36:29 >> A LOT LESS. YOU HAVE TO ASK THEM THAT

36:31 QUESTION. EMILY:

36:33 COMPANIES PLATFORM IS ALL ABOUT PRECISION IN REACHING MORE

36:41 DENSE URBAN AREAS.

36:43 >> ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS ABOUT MAKING THE SYSTEM

36:46 WORK IS HOW DO WE INTEGRATE WITH THE COMPANIES THAT WANT TO

36:51 TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS TO ENABLE TELEPORTATION FROM THEIR

36:54 BUSINESSES OR WAREHOUSES OR STORES DIRECTLY.

36:57 ZIPLINE CAN SHOW UP AND INSTALLING MAGICAL PORTAL IN

36:58 YOUR WALL. THAT IS HOW WE TALK ABOUT IT.

37:04 EMILY: IT IS A HARRY POTTER DOOR.

37:07 >> A RICK AND MORTY DOOR. YOU CAN CHOOSE. EMILY:

37:11 PIZZA AND COFFEE. EVERYBODY HAS TO HAVE PIZZA AND

37:14 COFFEE. IS THIS GOING TO SPILL? ALL RIGHT.

37:20 HERE YOU GO.

37:23 >> YOU JUST TELEPORTED SOMETHING VIA ZIPLINE.

37:27 WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER SILENTLY WITH DINNER PLATE

37:34 LEVEL ACCURACY. THIS IS THE ONLY THING COMING

37:38 CLOSE TO YOU, YOUR FAMILY, YOUR HOUSE, IT IS NOT MAKING MUCH

37:40 NOISE, IT IS TOTALLY SAFE. EMILY:

37:44 WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE UPS GUY? WHAT ABOUT JOBS?

37:49 >> DO TECHNOLOGY THERE IS ALWAYS A WORRY IT WILL PUT

37:50 PEOPLE OUT OF JOBS. WE ARE IN A WORLD WHERE

37:53 UNEMPLOYMENT IS THE LOWEST OVER THE LAST 30 YEARS.

37:58 THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH HUMANS TO DO THE WORK AND LABOR WE WANT

38:01 DONE TO LIVE RICH LIVES.

38:09 MANUS: YOU CAN FIND MORE STORIES FROM

38:14 BLOOMBERG ORIGINAL STREAMING ONLINE AND ON THE BLOOMBERG APP.

38:17 CAROL: CAN YOU SHARE WHAT YOU JUST

38:18 SAID? WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT CITIES?

38:25 MANUS: I GREW UP IN THE COUNTRYSIDE.

38:29 LIVED IN TWO WERE THREE MAJOR CITIES.

38:32 YOU GET CAUGHT IN THIS MYOPIA OF HOW CAN YOU HAVE DELIVERY

38:34 FROM DRONES? YOU JUST HEARD THAT IN TERMS OF

38:40 THE CAPACITY FOR THIS KIND OF DELIVERY MECHANISM, IT IS LIKE

38:42 BRINGING INTERNET TO THE PARTS OF AFRICA.

38:46 THIS IS ABOUT BILLIONS OF PEOPLE ACCEPTING NEW DELIVERIES.

38:50 CAROL: I WONDER IF OUR NEXT GUEST WILL

38:52 HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT DRONE DELIVERY.

38:55 HE IS ALL IN WHEN IT COMES TO TECHNOLOGY.

38:58 BULLISH FORECASTS ON APPLE. VERY UPBEAT ABOUT 2024.

39:03 DAN IVES IS COMING UP NEXT. HE WILL TALK ABOUT THE BULLISH

39:07 OUTLOOK FOR 2024.

39:24 >> THIS IS NOT AN ACCIDENT OR INFRINGEMENT.

39:27 THIS IS A DELIBERATE TAKING OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

39:32 APPLES DOCUMENTS SHOW THEY KNEW THEIR PRODUCT WAS NOT GOOD

39:34 ENOUGH TO BE USED MEDICALLY. THERE NEEDS TO BE AN HONEST

39:38 DIALOGUE THAT NEEDS TO BE AN APOLOGY.

39:41 THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN CAUGHT WITH THEIR HANDS IN THE COOKIE

39:42 JAR. INSTEAD OF BEING EMBARRASSED,

39:48 THEY ARE PLAYING IT -- THEY ARE BLAMING EVERYBODY AND FIGHTING

39:49 EVERY BLOODY. -- AND FIGHTING EVERYBODY.

39:54 CAROL: THAT IS THE COMPANY AT THE

39:55 CENTER OF APPLES WATCHBAND. THE USTR NOW SEEING TWO PATENTS

39:59 WERE INFRINGED, AND SAID -- INCLUDING THE ONE FROM THAT

40:03 COMPANY. A GREAT SET UP TO SEE WHAT DAN

40:06 IVES HAS TO SAY. SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST AT

40:10 WEDBUSH. GREAT TO HAVE YOU. DAN: GREAT TO BE HERE. CAROL:

40:16 HAPPY HOLIDAYS. IS IT GOING TO BE A HAPPY YEAR

40:19 FOR APPLE? DAN: DAN: I THINK IT IS TIME TO GET OUT

40:24 THE POPCORN BECAUSE IN MY OPINION THIS IS THE NEXT STAGE

40:26 OF THE GROWTH PHASE IN CUPERTINO. CAROL:

40:30 HOW DO YOU FACTOR IN THIS KIND OF STUFF? I NEED A NEW WATCH?

40:33 DAN: WE ARE TALKING LESS THAN 1% OF

40:36 DISRUPTION FROM APPLE WATCH. IT SPEAKS -- THEY WILL HAVE

40:42 PATENT ISSUES LIKE THIS ON HEALTH CARE.

40:45 THERE IS A RENAISSANCE OF GROWTH ON IPHONE UNITS,

40:48 SERVICES DOUBLE DIGITS. THAT IS WHY I THINK A LOT OF

40:52 THE BEARS ARE DEEP IN THE CAVES IN HIBERNATION.

40:56 I THINK A YEAR FROM NOW WE HAVE A $4 TRILLION CAP ON APPLE.

41:01 MANUS: YOU SAY THE BEARS HAD A GREAT

41:04 FICTIONAL STORY. DAN: A NETFLIX FICTIONAL STORY.

41:06 MANUS: I HAVE TO HAND IT TO YOU. THE SHIRT SCREAMS FULL

41:11 CONFIDENCE. YOU LOOK AT THE CHINA STORY.

41:18 HOW DO YOU GET TO $4 TRILLION WHEN YOU STILL HAVE THE

41:20 GOVERNMENT PUSHING BACK AGAINST APPLE PRODUCTS?

41:23 IT WAS A HEADLINE IN DECEMBER. IS THAT A MYTH OR A HEADWIND?

41:26 DAN: IS A HEADWIND, AND MY VIEW IN

41:31 TERMS OF CHINA IS I'M NOT SAYING IT IS ROSES AND

41:33 CHAMPAGNE IN BEIJING WITH APPLE. WE ARE SEEING GROWTH.

41:36 THAT IS SOMETHING WE ARE SEEING COME OUT OF ASIA OVER THE LAST

41:41 WEEK. WE HAVE 100 MILLION IPHONES IN

41:43 CHINA IN THE WINDOW OF AN UPGRADE.

41:50 FOR HUAWEI IS A GOOD PHONE BUT IT IS AN IPHONE 12 FROM A

41:53 FUNCTIONALITY PERSPECTIVE. I THINK IT IS A HEADWIND THEY

41:56 HAVE TO CONTEND WITH. IT IS THE HEARTS AND LUNGS OF

42:01 THE APPLE STORY AND THAT IS WHY A LOT OF THE BEARS -- IT IS ALL

42:06 ABOUT CHINA.

42:12 IT IS ALWAYS ABOUT THE BIG BAD WOLF, THE CHINA STORY.

42:16 CHINA HAS BEEN FUELING THE ENGINE. KATIE:

42:19 LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT THE BEARS ARE SAYING.

42:22 THEY SAY IN TERMS OF THE PRODUCT LINEUP APPLE HAS NOT

42:26 HAD A HIT SINCE AIRPODS IN 2016. YOU TALK ABOUT NEW GROWTH, BUT

42:31 FROM THE PRODUCT LINEUP WHERE WILL THAT COME FROM.

42:37 DAN: IS THE BEST INSTALL BASE IN THE

42:38 WORLD. FROM INSTALL BASE YOU HAVE 250

42:42 MILLION IPHONES. IPHONE 15, CHRISTMAS CAME EARLY.

42:50 FOR 2024, AND GURMAN HAS TALKED ABOUT THIS, I BELIEVE YOU WILL

42:55 HAVE NOXIOUS NEW PHONES FROM AN IPHONE 16 BUT WE BELIEVE YOU

43:00 WILL HAVE THE IPHONE APP STORE, NAI APP STORE.

43:05 THAT WILL BE SOMETHING INCREMENTAL.

43:08 THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT. YOU COMBINE IT WITH VISION PRO

43:13 AND MORE PRODUCTS COMING OUT, YOU FLEX THE MUSCLES. CAROL:

43:17 IS THERE A BEARISH STORY ON APPLE.

43:22 IF TOM KEENE WERE HERE -- WE ARE AN APPLE FAMILY.

43:25 IF WE GO TO BUY SOMETHING IT HAS TO BE AN APPLE PRODUCT.

43:27 KATIE: NO GREEN TEXT BUBBLES. NONE OF THAT. MANUS:

43:33 THERE IT -- CAROL: THERE IS AN APP YOU CAN GET.

43:36 THAT INSTALLED BASE. $397 BILLION.

43:42 ANY TIME THE APPLE NUMBERS CROSS THEY ARE OFF THE CHARTS.

43:47 EVEN IF THE GROWTH IS NOT SIGNIFICANT -- DAN:

43:52 IF TOM KEENE WAS HERE -- KATIE: HE KIND OF IS.

43:55 WE JUST HAVE THEM UNDER THE DESK. MANUS:

43:58 I AM INCARNATION OF TOM KEENE. I AM A HOLOGRAM. DAN:

44:02 IT IS A I GENERATED.

44:08 REALISTICALLY, IF YOU LOOK AT VALUATION, IF YOU LOOK AT THE

44:10 CASH FLOW GENERATION OF APPLE THAT WE WILL SEE OVER THE

44:13 YEARS, MARGINS ARE EXPANDING. A LOT OF THE BEARS LOOK AT

44:21 THEIR SPREADSHEETS ON PARK AVENUE IN THEIR TOWER. CAROL:

44:27 SO YOU DO NOT HAVE A BEAR STORY FOR APPLE? DAN:

44:31 THE STORY IS VALUATION, IT IS CHINA, IT IS A HEADWIND, BUT

44:34 MORE FICTIONAL THAN REALITY THAT WILL HURT THEM.

44:37 IT IS MORE COMPETITION. IT ALSO COMES DOWN TO VALUATION.

44:44 THAT IS WHY THIS YEAR, THE BEARS FOCUSED SO MUCH ON

44:46 VALUATION INSTEAD OF THE ACTUAL UNDERLYING GROWTH STORY THAT IS

44:50 HAPPENING NOXIOUS RAPIDLY BUT WE BELIEVE IT IS THE START OF A

44:52 NEW TECHNICAL MARKET. MANUS: THIS IS YOUR PIZZA -- THIS IS

44:56 YOUR THESIS NEXT YEAR. 2023 WAS A YEAR ANY TIME YOU

45:05 SAW NAI STORY -- CAROL: WE WERE TALKING ABOUT AI THIS

45:07 YEAR? KATIE: AI AND O'S EPIC.

45:14 -- AND OZEMPIC. MANUS: AI HAS BEEN THE DOMINANT FORCES

45:20 AS WELL AS BALANCE SHEETS IN TECH. LET'S PUT APPLE ASIDE.

45:27 CLOUD AND AI, HOW DO I DISAGGREGATE WHO WILL PERFORM

45:28 WELL? WHAT WILL MAKE A CLOUD A GRADE

45:36 AND AN AI A-GRADE STOCK? DAN:

45:42 IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING FROM A CLOUD

45:46 PERSPECTIVE, NOW THIS IS MORE MONETIZATION FROM THE HYPER

45:49 SCALE PLAYERS, FROM MICROSOFT, FOR AMAZON, FOR GOOGLE.

45:54 FOR CLOUD SPEND, THERE IS 35 TO 40 INCREMENTAL AI SPEND.

45:57 THAT IS WHY WHEN YOU LOOK AT MICROSOFT AND GOOGLE, THIS WILL

46:00 BE A NEW FRONTIER OF GROWTH. THEN YOU HAVE THE GODFATHER OF

46:04 AI. THIS IS JUST STARTING WHAT WE

46:08 VIEW AS A 1995 MOMENT. MANUS: THE GODFATHER OF AI.

46:13 CAROL: TOP-PERFORMING STOCK IN THE S&P

46:17 500. DAN: BIGGEST TECH TRANSMISSION IN 30

46:20 YEARS. HAVE NOT SEEN IT SINCE 1995.

46:25 WE BELIEVE THIS IS THE NEXT PHASE OF THE BULL MARKET. CAROL:

46:30 ARE THERE A MILLION AI ETF'S? KATIE:

46:33 THERE WERE A FEW DOZEN LAUNCHED WAY BEFORE WE STARTED TALKING

46:35 ABOUT AI LAST YEAR. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT EB DEMAND.

46:41 -- ABOUT EV DEMAND. IT FEELS LIKE ALL OF THESE

46:46 AUTOMAKERS MISCALCULATED HOW MUCH DEMAND THERE WOULD BE FOR

46:51 EV'S AND NOW YOU ARE SEEING PRODUCTION TARGETS CUT.

46:55 HOW DOES THAT FACTOR INTO WHAT YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT TESLA?

47:00 IS THAT A BEAR CASE FOR TESLA OR JUST TESLA COMMAND MORE OF A

47:01 SHRINKING PIE? DAN: RIGHT NOW IT IS TESLA'S WORLD

47:06 AND EVERYONE ELSE'S PAYING RENT. THEY ARE DOUBLING DOWN.

47:13 YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENED TO DETROIT, GM, FORD PEELING BACK

47:15 FROM LARGER VEHICLES. DEMAND HAS SOFTENED.

47:19 PRICE WARS HAVE COME THROUGH. A LOT OF THE STORMS HAVE PASSED.

47:26 FOR TESLA, UNIT VOLUME LOOKS STRONG IN CHINA.

47:31 THIS WILL BE A RECORD QUARTER FOR CHINA IN TERMS OF Q4.

47:36 YOU GO INTO NEXT YEAR, I THINK DEMAND STARTS TO ACCELERATE

47:38 RELATIVE TO WHERE PEOPLE THOUGHT. I THINK FOR THE OVERALL

47:43 INDUSTRY IT IS STILL A MASSIVE TRANSFORMATION BUT NOW YOU ARE

47:49 STARTING TO PEEL BACK IN TERMS OF MAYBE 25% TO 30% PENETRATION.

47:52 KATIE: CHINA IS THE RALLYING CALL OF

47:54 THE BEARS. SO TOO WHEN IT COMES TO TESLA.

48:01 HOW DOES TESLA COMPETE OVERSEAS? DAN:

48:05 A LOT OF THE PRICE WAR, THIS WAS A POKER MOVE FOR THE AGES

48:08 BY ELON MUSK. CUT PRICES AND FOCUS ON UNITS.

48:13 RIGHT NOW THIS HAS FLEXED THE MUSCLES IN BEIJING FOR APPLE

48:17 DESPITE BEAR NOISE. CAROL: BEFORE WE STARTED WE SHOWED A

48:21 PIECE ON DRONES. 25 SECONDS, IS THERE A DRONE

48:24 PLAY FOR YOU? AMAZON IS IN IT, WALMART?

48:30 DAN: I THINK THAT HAS PASSED. I REMEMBER BEING AT CS YEARS

48:34 AGO. CAROL: YOU DON'T BUY IT? DAN:

48:40 THAT IS WHY YOU HAVE TO SEPARATE.

48:42 YOU SEPARATE HYPE FROM THE REALITY.

48:44 THERE ARE PARTS OF THAT MARKET THAT ARE GROWTH BUT YOU LOOK AT

48:49 AI, THIS IS THE SUPER BOWL IN TERMS OF TECH MARKET. MANUS:

48:53 -- CAROL: WE WILL HAVE A BULL TECH MARKET

48:56 IN 2025? DAN: I THINK THIS BULL MARKET GOES

49:02 FOR ANOTHER TWO YEARS. THAT IS WHY RIGHT NOW IS

49:04 GETTING THE POPCORN OUT.

49:12 CAROL: DAN IVES OF WEDBUSH. CHECK OUT HIS CALLS ON APPLE

49:15 AND THE TECH MARKET. COMING UP NEXT, TOM TZITZOURIS

49:20 OF STRATEGAS. COUNTING DOWN THE LAST FIVE

49:24 DAYS OF 2023. COMING BACK. THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

49:53 FROM A MARKET PERSPECTIVE THE FED IS EXPECTED TO START

49:54 CUTTING.

50:01 >> IT LOOKS LIKE THE INFLATION BEAST HAS BEEN SLAYED.

50:07 >> THE NEW TERM EVERYONE SEEMS TO BE TOO HAPPY.

50:13 THE QUESTION WILL BE WHAT MORE DOES THE FED NEED TO DO?

50:18 THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE WITH TOM KEENE JONATHAN FERRO

50:19 AND LISA ABRAMOWICZ. MANUS:

50:25 FROM NEW YORK CITY AND OUR GLOBAL AUDIENCE WORLDWIDE GOOD

50:29 MORNING IT IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE LIVE

50:39 YOUR USUAL GROUP IS ON VACATION RESTING WELL AFTER A

50:40 LONG YEAR.

50:46 GOOD MORNING LADIES AND HAPPY HOLIDAYS IT WILL BE A FULL

50:49 MONTY OF RISK AT THIS WEEK. WE HAVE THE PCE THAT SET US UP

50:53 FOR A HOMERUN IN BONDS. CAROL:

50:59 IT CERTAINLY HAS FELT THAT WAY AND I WONDERED DURING THIS

51:03 QUIET WEEK THERE WILL BE A TON OF ACTIVITY BUT I THINK ABOUT

51:09 THANKSGIVING WHEN THERE WAS A QUIET WEEK AND THINGS STARTED

51:12 HAPPENING. KATIE: HOPEFULLY WE DON'T START

51:15 EATING CROW BY THE END OF THE WEEK.

51:22 THERE ARE NO EARNINGS THIS WEEK EARNINGS SEASON NEVER TRULY

51:24 ENDS BUT MAYBE WE CAN PUT A PIN IN IT.

51:29 WE COULD SEE THE DRAMA WITH THE PRICE ACTION WHEN HE THINK

51:31 ABOUT GLOBAL LIQUIDITY. IT DOES MATTER WHEN YOU THINK

51:39 ABOUT THIS WEEKLY GAME STREAK WHETHER IT CONTINUES OR BREAKS

51:43 THAT COULD BE THE ONE NEWS WE GET. MANUS:

51:48 WE JUST HAD A WONDERFUL CONVERSATION ABOUT ALL THINGS

51:54 TECH AND THE 4 TRILLION CALL FOR APPLE FROM WEDBUSH BUT WHEN

51:59 YOU LOOK AT THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, THIS EQUITY MARKET

52:05 DOESN'T NEED 160 BASIS POINTS OF CUTS. CAROL:

52:16 I KEEP THINKING OF THE LIQUIDITY STORY.

52:22 WHETHER IT'S INVESTORS, COMPANIES, I'M CURIOUS TO SEE

52:23 WHAT KIND OF SHOPPING WE WILL SEE? MANUS:

52:29 GLOBAL SHOPPING? CAROL:

52:35 I HOPE JOHN IS ON WATCHING NO SHOPPING, JUST EATING. MANUS:

52:42 EQUITIES HAD AN EIGHT WEEK WINNING STREAK. U.S.

52:45 EQUITIES ARE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER .1%.

52:52 EURO-DOLLAR AT 1.101.

52:58 AN EXPECTED RATE CUT FROM THE ECB IN MARCH.

53:04 10 YEAR YIELD AT 3.889. CAROL:

53:10 IT ACTUALLY TURNED OUT TO BE THE YEAR OF THE BOND.

53:19 CRUDENESS FLAT DESPITE THE MILITARY MOVEMENT BY THE U.S.

53:24 AGAINST TARGETS IN IRAQ LET'S

53:30 BRING IN TOM ZITZOURIS. THE U.S. BOND MARKET PULLED IT BACK FROM

53:37 THE JAWS OF DEFEAT.

53:44 DOES THAT SET ME UP FOR MAGNIFICENT 2024 AT 3.88.

53:52 TOM: IT DEPENDS ON WHETHER WE HAVE A

53:53 RECESSION AND IT'S HARD TO PREDICT AT THIS POINT IN TIME

54:01 BECAUSE WASHINGTON HAS DECIDED TO RUN THE ECONOMY AT FULL

54:04 EMPLOYMENT WHICH MEANS IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR THE CONSUMER

54:05 TO PULL BACK. WE HAVE A SEASONAL WEAK SPOT

54:13 COMING IN THE NEXT FUSE -- FEW MONTHS.

54:21 EXPECT THOSE RATE CUTS TO MATERIALIZE IN THE BOND MARKET

54:23 TO PUSH YIELDS LOWER. IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT SEASONAL

54:29 WEAK SPOT IT WILL BE HARD FOR THE BOND MARKET TO RALLY

54:30 FURTHER FROM HERE. MANUS: THEY'RE GOING TO RUN THIS

54:38 ECONOMY AT FULL SPEED, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

54:40 WHAT ARE THE ADDITIONAL RISKS?

54:46 ONE WAS ABOUT ISSUANCE AND INDIGESTION IN THE BOND MARKET.

54:50 WE DID NOT GET INDIGESTION ON THESE BOND AUCTIONS AT THE BACK

54:54 END OF THE YEAR, WHAT IS MY RISK IN 2024? TOM:

54:59 IT DEPENDS ON WHAT THE FED DOES. I BELIEVE 2024 WILL BE THE YEAR

55:04 WE HAVE A SERIOUS DISCUSSION OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE'S

55:07 CREDIBILITY AS A SEPARATE ENTITY.

55:12 IF YOU LOOK AT THE ECONOMY IT IS IN A DECENT SPOT,

55:13 UNEMPLOYMENT IS LOW. IT'S HARD TO JUSTIFY RATE CUTS

55:18 BY MARCH. BUT THE MARKET IS PRICING IN

55:22 150 POINTS. CAROL: IS THAT TOO AGGRESSIVE?

55:29 TOM: MAYBE 50, 75 AT FULL EMPLOYMENT BUT 150?

55:36 THAT'S A STEEP AMOUNT OF CUTS FOR SOMETHING THAT IS NOT A

55:37 RECESSION. CAROL:

55:44 ONE OF OUR FAVORITE DRINKING GAMES WAS DATED-DEPENDENT.

55:46 HOW MANY TIMES THAT THE FED TELL US WE ARE WATCHING THE

55:48 DATA POINTS?

55:54 DO WE NEED TO WATCH THESE DATA POINTS CLOSELY? TOM:

55:57 I WOULD CONTINUE TO WATCH WAGES. HOURLY EARNINGS AND COST INDEX

56:05 ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT ONES. THAT WILL TELL US IF WE HAVE

56:12 ROOM TO CUT BUT WAGES WILL TELL US OF CPI RE-ACCELERATES AFTER

56:13 THE CUTS HIT.

56:20 WAGES ARE GOING UP 4%, HOW CAN YOU STAY AT 2% OF RATE CUTS

56:23 CULMINATE? I DON'T SEE THAT RIGHT NOW.

56:32 CAROL: WHAT WORRIES YOU IN TERMS OF

56:34 THE ECONOMIC STORY? THE FACT WE ARE ALL EXPECTING A

56:39 MORE AGGRESSIVE FED? TOM: I HAVE TWO WORRIES, THE

56:47 CONSUMER IS RUNNING OUT EXHAUSTION BUILDING UP CREDIT

56:51 CARD DEBT AND WE ARE SEEING SEASONAL PULLBACKS.

57:00 THE CONSUMER IS BINGING FROM IN TO AUGUST AND THEN HALLOWEEN TO

57:03 NEW YEAR'S AND EVERY SIX MONTHS THE PULLBACK GETS BIGGER AND

57:07 BIGGER. IT WILL REQUIRE MORE AND MORE

57:10 STIMULUS. BUT YOU ARE KEEPING THE ECONOMY

57:16 OF FULL EMPLOYMENT. KATIE: I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE

57:23 POLITICS OF THE FED AND THE DISCUSSION COMING TO THE

57:25 INDEPENDENCE OF THE FED. YOU THINK ABOUT FED CUTTING BY

57:30 MARCH, IS A POLITICAL? CAROL:

57:33 THE ARGUMENT THEY ARE MAKING IS THEY WANT TO GET OUT OF

57:42 RESTRICTIVE TERRITORY.

57:44 KATIE: DO YOU NOT BUY THAT ARGUMENT?

57:47 TOM:

57:53 NEUTRAL MIGHT BE 5%, IT'S NOT THREE POINT 50.

57:56 WHY IS THE FUTURES MARKET PRICING IN SUCH AN EXTREME

57:59 AMOUNT OF RATE CUTS WHEN THE ECONOMY AND EQUITY MARKETS ARE

58:04 ALL PROJECTING DIFFERENTLY? I THINK FUTURE MARKETS ARE

58:11 QUESTIONING THE CREDIBILITY OF THE FED, THE TREASURY WILL HAVE

58:15 LIQUIDITY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE YEAR.

58:18 IF YOU LOOK TO JUNE YOU SAY RATE CUTS NEED TO HAPPEN BEFORE

58:23 THEN. KATIE: I FEEL LIKE WE DON'T TALK ABOUT

58:28 THE TREASURY ENOUGH.

58:30 IF WE ENTER INTO A PERIOD WHERE FEDS ARE CUTTING RATES, WHAT

58:39 DOES THAT MEAN FOR THE BOND MARKET?

58:42 HOW DOES THE FED MESSAGE THAT AND HOW IS IT RECEIVED BY THE

58:47 MARKET? AT FIRST GLANCE THAT WOULD

58:50 APPEAR THE FED IS ACTING AT OPPOSITE ENDS? TOM:

58:54 THIS WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR THE FED TO DELIVER ON THIS

59:00 POLITICALLY IT WILL LOOK LIKE THEY ARE BEING ACCOMMODATIVE

59:04 REGARDLESS OF WHAT THEY DO.

59:06 THEY WILL HAVE TO COMMUNICATE THIS IN A WAY EITHER THROUGH

59:15 AMPLE RESERVES IN THE BANKING SYSTEM, STOPPING FALLACY

59:16 REDUCTION BECAUSE THERE COULD BE LIQUIDITY ISSUES.

59:21 THAT WILL BE A QUESTIONABLE ARGUMENT. MANUS:

59:27 I WAS MULLING THIS OVER LAST NIGHT, WE GOT OBSESSED WITH THE

59:33 BASES TRADE. THE BANK OF ENGLAND NOTED IT.

59:40 WHAT IS THE RISK OF SOME KIND OF AN ERUPTION OR REVERSAL OF

59:44 THE BASE TRADE?

59:52 TALK ABOUT THE RISK FROM BASES TRADE? TOM:

59:59 THE RISK IS THAT YOU HAVE LIQUIDITY PROVIDERS BECOME

01:00:02 SOMEONE WHO IS LARGE AND DEPENDENT.

01:00:07 IN THE FINANCIAL CRISIS WHEN WE WERE DEPENDENT ON PROVIDER

01:00:13 DEALERS AND BASIS TRADERS. WHEN YOU BECOME OVERLY RELIANT

01:00:18 ON ONE TYPE OF LIQUIDITY PROVIDER YOU ARE ALWAYS A RISK

01:00:22 AND ODDS ARE THE PROVIDER WILL HAVE A PULLBACK WHICH WILL

01:00:31 CASCADE INTO A FULL MARKET LIQUIDITY SEES A. CAROL:

01:00:35 WE HAVE BEEN SO U.S. FOCUSED BUT I WONDER ABOUT THE

01:00:40 GLOBAL BOND STORY. HOW DO YOU FACTOR ALL OF THAT

01:00:43 IN? TOM:

01:00:49 THE ECONOMIC WEAKNESSES GREATER OUTSIDE OF THE U.S.

01:00:50 AND AS A CONSEQUENCE YOU SHOULD SEE OTHER CENTRAL BANKS OF IT

01:00:54 THEMSELVES AND MOVE TOWARDS RATE CATS.

01:00:57 YOU WILL SEE OTHER CENTRAL BANKS PULLED THEMSELVES BACK

01:01:00 FROM BALANCE SHEET REDUCTIONS. THERE SHOULD BE GLOBAL SUPPORT

01:01:04 FOR THE BOND MARKETS BECAUSE YOU HAVE A WEAKENING BOND

01:01:07 MARKET ECONOMY. CAROL: FAVORITE BOND MARKET?

01:01:13 TOM: RIGHT NOW, THE U.S.. MANUS: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING

01:01:19 WITH US THIS HOLIDAY.

01:01:28 TOM ZITZOURKIS. YOU HAVE EIGHT WEEKS ON THE

01:01:38 S&P 500, THE CONSUMER HAS NOT REACHED EXHAUSTION YET.

01:01:42 WE HAD WEDBUSH SAY THAT WE WILL HAVE A TWO-YEAR RUN IN 10 YEAR

01:01:45 TRADES.

01:01:51 WILL THE FED ACTUALLY CUPPED BY 150 BASIS POINTS?

01:02:02 TENURE AT 3.89 AND CRUDEST FLAT UP BY .29% WITH THE TENSION

01:02:06 AROUND IRAQ. CAROL: IT'S QUIET BUT INTERESTING.

01:02:10 MANUS: I THINK WITH THE IRAQ STORY

01:02:18 AND WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE RED SEA, IS PERHAPS ONE OF THE

01:02:23 UNDERPRICED RISKS AS WELL AS TAIWAN. THE U.S.

01:02:28 RISK HAS NOT GONE AWAY. KATIE:

01:02:36 THE CONVERSATION WE HAD ABOUT HOW THE CONVERSATION WILL BE

01:02:38 DOMINATED BY POLITICS. WHAT A TRICKY SITUATION TO

01:02:45 NAVIGATE THESE WARS GOING ON WHILE TRYING TO APPEAL TO THE

01:02:49 AMERICAN VOTER WHO WAS INTERESTED IN DOMESTIC ISSUES.

01:02:53 IT IS GOING TO BE A DIFFICULT ROAD AND INTERESTING HAVE A

01:02:59 PLACE OUT. CAROL: THE WORLD IS WATCHING.

01:03:03 THEY ARE WATCHING THE ELECTIONS AND WORRIED ABOUT WHO HEADS UP

01:03:06 AT THE WHITE HOUSE AFTER THE NOVEMBER ELECTIONS BECAUSE WHAT

01:03:10 IS IT MEAN FOR THESE GLOBAL TENSIONS WE ARE SEEING? MANUS:

01:03:17 AND OF COURSE WE ARE WAITING TO SEE WHERE WE ARE WITH

01:03:19 CONGRESS WHEN IT COMES TO THE SHUTDOWNS. CAROL:

01:03:24 HAVEN'T WE ALREADY DEALT WITH THAT THIS YEAR? KATIE:

01:03:26 IT NEVER ENDS. CAROL: I'M CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT THE

01:03:34 CEOS SAY ABOUT EARNINGS IN THE COMFORT THEY HAVE ON PUTTING

01:03:35 OUT OUTLOOKS? MANUS:

01:03:44 LET'S HEAR ABOUT RECESSION EXPECTATIONS.

01:03:51 COMING UP ON THE SHOW WE WILL

01:04:10 >> THERE IS A RISK TO SHIFTING TO A SEVEN STANCE.

01:04:16 THE RISK IS YOU DON'T MAKE AS MUCH PROGRESS AS YOU WANT ON

01:04:19 THE INFLATION FRONT THERE IS NO FREE LUNCH IN THAT REGARD WE

01:04:22 THINK THE FED IS IN A GOOD SPOT WITH RATE CUTS COMING. MANUS:

01:04:33 GOOD MORNING, IT IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE.

01:04:39 LET'S TALK ABOUT THE MARKETS, YOU'RE COMING OFF FROM THE

01:04:40 HOLIDAY.

01:04:46 EQUITIES ARE UP FOR EIGHT WEEKS IN A ROW. CAROL: QUITE A RUN?

01:04:54 KATIE: BUT QUIET.

01:05:00 WE ARE MOVING TO THE UPSIDE BUT WE REALLY LEVELED OUT.

01:05:03 BUT IT ADDS UP ON A WEEKLY BASIS. MANUS:

01:05:10 THE QUESTION IS WHETHER IF IT'S NOW WILL REQUIRE TRADE.

01:05:16 THE BOND MARKETS ARE SITTING IN AN EXTREME POSITION IN THE LONG

01:05:18 END OF THE CURVE AND THAT'S WHERE WHEN THINGS BECOME

01:05:24 CROWDED IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH TO DISLOCATE EARNINGS.

01:05:27 LOOK AT NIKE WITH A 2 BILLION COST-CUTTING PROGRAM? CAROL:

01:05:31 THIS IS WHY I LIKE EARNINGS.

01:05:39 ARE THEY FEELING WAGE PRESSURES. WHEN A POWERHOUSE LIKE NIKE

01:05:41 TALKS ABOUT SIGNIFICANT CUTS.

01:05:48 AND YOU SAW A LOT OF THE PIERS TRADE DOWN IN SYMPATHY.

01:05:53 IT FEELS LIKE SOME OF THESE STORIES ARE IDIOSYNCRATIC TO

01:05:58 NIKE BUT THERE IS THIS UNDERLYING NERVOUSNESS. MANUS:

01:06:03 WHEN WE LOOK AT SOME OF THESE

01:06:13 BIG REAL -- RETAIL PLAYS, IT WAS PRO-CHINA, CHINA WILL SAVE

01:06:15 US ALL. SAVE THE COMMODITY MARKET IN

01:06:17 THE INDUSTRIALS.

01:06:24 THE GREAT CHINA REOPENING SIMPLY DID NOT EVOLVE LIKE WE

01:06:29 ALL THOUGHT. LOOK AT HEIGHT AND LUXURY, IT

01:06:33 IS REALLY SUFFERING BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PUSH OUT PRODUCT IN

01:06:39 CHINA LOOK AT GOLDMAN SACHS? CHINA IS NO LONGER CORRELATED

01:06:44 WITH EMERGING MARKETS.

01:06:50 KATIE: JUST GOING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTION CHINA TO THE BOTTOM

01:06:54 THERE IN EMERGING MARKETS GOING HIGHER.

01:07:04 CAROL: WE WILL GO BACK TO OUR LAST

01:07:10 GUEST, WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE MARKET? THE U.S.

01:07:15 MARKET OUTPERFORMING AND FEELING LIKE A SAFE BET.

01:07:18 I WONDER IF THAT PLACE INTO THE THE CORPORATE DEBT SIDE OF

01:07:20 THINGS? MANUS:

01:07:31 SO LET'S BRING IN OUR GUEST

01:07:37 THIS MORNING, CALEB IS JOINING US NOW GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US.

01:07:45 IS IT A CASE OF INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT, A FREE RIDE.

01:07:51 IS THAT THE ULTIMATE TRADE U.S. INVESTOR GREAT CREDIT

01:07:52 OUTPERFORMING THE REST OF THE WORLD?

01:07:58 >> A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WE TALKED TO ARE VERY BULLISH

01:08:00 ABOUT THE U.S. CREDIT MARKET.

01:08:06 WHEN WE STARTED THIS YEAR EVERYONE SAID IT WOULD BE THE

01:08:10 YEAR OF THE BOND AND WE SAW VOLATILITY IN MARCH.

01:08:14 NEXT YEAR WE ARE EXPECTING THE FED TO CUT RATES IN THE BONDS

01:08:19 BECAUSE THEY ARE LONG AND BONDS, THERE WILL BE A HUGE

01:08:21 PUSH FOR THESE BONDS. CAROL:

01:08:28 HOW ACTIVE DO YOU EXPECT THE U.S.

01:08:29 MARKET AND SECTORS PLAYING INTO IT? CALEB:

01:08:35 WERE EXPECTING A BUSY JANUARY. IF YOU LOOK BACK OVER THE PAST

01:08:44 10 YEARS THE ISSUANCE HAS BEEN 20 BILLION AND NEXT MONTH

01:08:46 EXPECT 160 BILLION. CAROL: WHY IS IT MORE IN JANUARY?

01:08:54 CALEB: FINANCIALS ARE THE BIGGEST

01:08:55 ISSUERS.

01:09:02 THEN YOU HAVE EARNINGS COMING IN AND A LOT OF THESE COMPANIES

01:09:06 ARE ABLE TO GROW AND SELL OFF WITHOUT. KATIE:

01:09:11 LET'S EXTEND BEYOND JANUARY AND THE ISSUANCE PICTURE.

01:09:17 IT FEELS LIKE SOME OF THIS PAST YEAR ISSUERS HAD TO BE

01:09:22 OPPORTUNISTIC IN LOOK FURTHER FOR WINDOWS TO SELL BONDS.

01:09:26 IT WAS EXPECTED FROM THE FED REACHING THE END OF ITS

01:09:32 TIGHTENING CYCLE?

01:09:34 COULD WE GO TO THE ENVIRONMENT WHERE BORROWERS SELL THEIR

01:09:39 BONDS? ?

01:09:41 CALEB: THERE ARE EXPECTATIONS THAT THE

01:09:43 FED IS GOING TO CUT RATES AND THAT SHOULD ENTICE A LOT OF

01:09:49 BORROWERS TO COME TO THE MARKET. ONE THING I WOULD LIKE TO

01:09:54 MENTION, INVESTORS ARE WORRIED ABOUT SO MANY THINGS SOME YOU

01:09:59 HAVE TO BORROW FOR THE RIGHT REASON AND INVESTORS ARE

01:10:04 LOOKING AT THIS.

01:10:06 WE HAVE NOT SEEN A LOT OF ISSUANCE TO BUYBACK STOCKS.

01:10:11 THERE WILL BE WINDOWS TO BORROW BUT THEY ARE BEING CAREFUL

01:10:17 ABOUT IT. KATIE: ARE WE GOING TO SEE ESD: SOLD?

01:10:26 IT FEELS LIKE AUTOMAKERS

01:10:34 OVERESTIMATED EV HOW DOES THE LOOK ON THE BOND PICTURE? CALEB:

01:10:42 A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO INVESTORS WERE HAPPY TO PAY MORE AND GIVE

01:10:46 THE ISSUERS THE BENEFIT TO BRING THESE TO THE MARKET BUT

01:10:50 THAT HAS CHANGED. YOU HAVE A LOT OF PUSHBACK

01:10:58 COMING FROM THE PUBLIC AND WOKE CAPITALISM.

01:11:04 IF YOU PUT A LABEL ON THE BOND THEY WILL ASK YOU WHAT IS GREEN

01:11:07 ABOUT THIS OR SOCIAL ABOUT THIS? IT THEY DON'T WANT TO ATTRACT

01:11:13 THE KIND OF ATTENTION WHEN THEY COME TO THE MARKET.

01:11:19 A LOT OF FIRMS SAY THEY DON'T SEE THAT CHANGING GOING FORWARD?

01:11:23 KATIE: IT'S POLITICIZED? MANUS:

01:11:33 DO YOU SEE IS SIGNIFICANT WALL OF REFINANCING, WHAT ARE THE

01:11:39 NUMBERS LOOK LIKE IT WILL THAT BE AN OBSTACLE?

01:11:45 CALEB: IT WILL BOOST ISSUANCE GOING

01:11:48 INTO NEXT YEAR.

01:11:55 YOU DON'T WANT TO BORROW

01:12:00 -- THEY WILL WANT TO TAKE A CHANCE TO REFINANCE BY NEXT

01:12:11 YEAR.

01:12:12 ON THE INVESTMENT-GRADE SIDE OF THINGS. MANUS:

01:12:21 THE NARRATIVE IS A SOFT LANDING, AND IMMACULATE

01:12:23 DISINFLATION, 150 BASIS POINTS OF CUTS.

01:12:29 IF WE LOOK BACK IN 1995 AT THE LAST SOFT LANDING FOR DEFAULT

01:12:33 RATE, WHAT'S THE NEXT OFFRAMP?

01:12:39 CALEB: NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE EXPECT

01:12:46 TERRIBLE DEFAULTS.

01:12:48 WE WILL SEE QUITE A FEW DOWNGRADES.

01:12:50 A LOT OF PEOPLE WORRIED ABOUT REGIONAL BANKS AND PEOPLE DON'T

01:12:52 WANT TO TOUCH THOSE KIND OF BONDS. CAROL: REAL ESTATE DEBT?

01:12:59 CALEB: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE AND THEY

01:13:03 HAVE HUGE EXPOSURE TO COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE. MANUS:

01:13:06 CALEB, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:13:12 SETTING UP THE BOND STORY ON THE INVESTMENT GRAY HIGH YIELDS

01:13:14 GOING INTO 2024.

01:13:20 COMING UP AT 8:45, WE WILL TALK TO DARREN CHESLEY, SHE JOINS US

01:13:29 TO TELL US WHETHER RETAILERS HAVE HAD A HAPPY HOLIDAY.

01:13:33 BUT WHERE DOES IT STAND ON RISK, THERE IS GREEN ON THE

01:13:36 SCREEN. WE WILL HAVE A TWO-YEAR TECH

01:13:39 RALLY.

01:13:52 IN A RATE CUT RACE BETWEEN EUROPE AND THE FED.

01:13:56 CRUDENESS INCHING HIGHER AS THE U.S.

01:13:57 LAUNCHES TARGETED STRIKES IN IRAQ THIS MORNING.

01:14:11 MANUS:

01:14:17 FOR OUR AUDIENCE WORLDWIDE A GOOD MORNING.

01:14:22 THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE, A VERY GOOD MORNING.

01:14:27 A QUICK SNAPSHOT OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE EQUITY MARKETS.

01:14:32 S&P 500 AT A 4808.75. YOU HAVE HAD IT WEEKS OF THE

01:14:36 WINNING STREAK.

01:14:43 GOOGLE, MICROSOFT AND NVIDIA, ARE NOT GOING TO SEE A YEAR

01:14:47 LIKE 1995. MASTEC FEATURES OF .11%.

01:14:54 RUSSELL 2000, THERE WAS A PICKUP LAST WEEK THAT WE HAD

01:14:57 NOT SEEN IN A WHILE.

01:15:04 STOCKS ARE MUTED, WE HAD GOOD CORE PCE DATA THAT HELP THE

01:15:06 BOND MARKET TRADE HIGHER.

01:15:09 AND WE START THE AGENDA HERE AT TWO-YEAR GUILDS RAISING

01:15:17 SLIGHTLY.

01:15:18 WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE BOND MARKETS AND HOW THE

01:15:20 ECONOMY WILL RUN HARD.

01:15:26 3.8948 AT THE 10 YEAR. COULD YIELDS BACK UP A LITTLE

01:15:29 BIT? THIS MARKET IS OVER CONCENTRATED AT THE LONG AND.

01:15:39 EURO-DOLLAR TRADE AT 1.1014. LET'S GET YOU UP TO SPEED OUT

01:15:44 WHAT IS UNDER SURVEILLANCE THIS MORNING.

01:15:49 THERE IS ONE STORY THAT IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT ABOUT

01:15:52 THE TENSIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AFTER A SERIES OF STRIKES IN

01:15:59 IRAQ BETWEEN TERRORIST AND THE U.S. MILITARY.

01:16:08 A DRONE STRIKE THE U.S. FACILITY.

01:16:15 EARLY ASSESSMENTS INDICATE THAT THESE U.S.

01:16:17 AIRSTRIKES DESTROYED FACILITIES

01:16:24 AND LIKELY KILLED THE NUMBER OF MILITANTS ADDING THERE ARE NO

01:16:25 INDICATIONS OF CIVILIAN LIVES AFFECTED.

01:16:29 WHEN IT COMES TO INVESTING, CATHIE WOOD MADE HER FIRST

01:16:38 SHARES OF A JAPANESE INTERNET COMPANY.

01:16:50 FINTECH BUYING SHARES IN A WIDE. -- LY.

01:17:02 POISED FOR IS BEST YEAR SINCE 2020.

01:17:06 CATHIE WOOD WILL JOIN THE TEAM AROUND THE DESK ON THURSDAY AT

01:17:10 7:30 ON BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE. BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU DO WITH

01:17:14 THEIR CHILDREN AT CHRISTMAS.

01:17:21 SPIRIT AIRLINES ISSUING AN APOLOGY AFTER PUTTING A MINOR

01:17:25 ON THE WRONG FLIGHT RIGHT BEFORE THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND.

01:17:31 THE SIX-YEAR-OLD WAS SET TO FLY FROM PHILADELPHIA TO FORT MYERS

01:17:36 BUT INSTEAD HE WAS PUT ON A FLIGHT TO ORLANDO.

01:17:41 THEY DID NOT ADDRESS HOW THE ERROR CAME ABOUT.

01:17:47 THE STOCK IS DOWN MORE THAN 13%. CAROL: INCORRECTLY BOARDED?

01:17:53 KATIE: ALSO UNACCOMPANIED MINOR, WERE

01:17:57 TALKING ABOUT A SIX YEAR OLD. MANUS: IT'S LIKE HOME ALONE.

01:18:10 7.5 MILLION PEOPLE ARE EXPECTED TO FLY BETWEEN DECEMBER 23 AND

01:18:17 JANUARY FIRST. CAROL: GOOD LUCK TO THEM. MANUS:

01:18:20 I JUST TOOK AMTRAK. CAROL: WHERE WORKING ON TRADE TRAVEL.

01:18:24 MANUS:

01:18:31 JIM ZELLNER CALLS PRIVATE CREDIT OF 40 TRILLION

01:18:37 OPPORTUNITY AND A 2008 CRISIS IS UNLIKELY TO HAPPEN AGAIN.

01:18:44 HE SPOKE TO BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE AT APOLLO

01:18:50 HEADQUARTERS EARLIER THIS MONTH. >> WHAT IS DE-BANKING?

01:18:58 >> I USE THE EVOLUTION OF FINANCE.

01:19:03 WE HAVE HAD AMAZING TAILWINDS WITH LOCALIZATION AND

01:19:04 TECHNOLOGY AND LOWER RATES. BANKS WERE ADVISORS FOR DECADES.

01:19:16 2008 HAPPENS AND THERE'S A LOT OF LEGISLATION THAT CHANGES OUR

01:19:20 BUSINESS MODEL BUT AT THE SAME TIME, RATES WERE LOWER.

01:19:31 AND CEOS ARE FOCUSED ON SHAREHOLDER RETURN THERE IS A

01:19:34 MASSIVE GAP WHERE COMPANIES NEED TO FIND CAPITAL AND FIRMS

01:19:40 HAVE BEEN AT THE FRONT OF THE PARADE IN TERMS OF PROVIDING

01:19:42 CAPITAL ACROSS OUR BUSINESS. WHEN HE PUT THAT TOGETHER WITH

01:19:49 OUR FUNDING MODEL OF LP CAPITAL FROM AROUND THE GLOBE PLUS

01:19:54 RETIREMENT SERVICES, WE ARE UNIQUE PLAYER. MANUS:

01:19:59 LET'S GET INTO HOW BIG THE ADDRESSABLE MARKET IS.

01:20:07 WE THINK OF LEVERAGED MARKETS, EVERYTHING ON THE BANK BALANCE

01:20:08 SHEET, HOW BIG WOULD THIS BE? JIM:

01:20:15 YOU TALKED ABOUT PRIVATE CAPITAL IN PRIVATE MARKETS.

01:20:18 WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT PRIVATE CREDIT THEY TALK ABOUT DIRECT

01:20:22 ORIGINATION WHICH IS 1.5 TRILLION.

01:20:26 WE THINK THE DEFINITION OF PRIVATE CAPITAL IS AROUND 40

01:20:30 TRILLION AND THAT WOULD CONSIST OF SOLAR FRAMES, INVENTORY

01:20:36 FINANCE, FRANCHISE FINANCE ALONG WITH A LOT OF CORPORATE

01:20:43 LENDING AND INVESTMENT GRADE PRIVATE THAT BANKS USED TO HOLD

01:20:46 ON THEIR BALANCE SHEET BUT IN THEIR SEARCH OF OUR OB THAT'S

01:20:50 NOT THE RIGHT PLACE TO HOLD THAT.

01:20:53 IT MAY BE THE RIGHT PLACE TO ORIGINATED BUT NOT TO HOLD IT.

01:20:58 TOM: I WANT TO GET OUT OF THE WAY

01:21:07 THE STEREOTYPE THAT IS FANCY DERIVATIVES .

01:21:15 ON YOUR WEBSITE YOU LEAD WITH RETIREMENT SERVICES.

01:21:18 HOW CONSERVATIVE IS APOLLO? JIM: WE DON'T LIKE TO LOSE MONEY.

01:21:30 WE LOOK AT OUR FIRM TODAY, 630 BILLION, 100 BILLION A PRIVATE

01:21:33 EQUITY, 400 BILLION IN CREDIT. A VAST MAJORITY OF THAT IS

01:21:40 INVESTMENT GRADE IN THIS YEAR ALONE, WHETHER IT'S AIR FRANCE,

01:21:46 AT&T, WE ARE LOANING MONEY TO COMPANIES THAT ARE

01:21:52 INVESTMENT-GRADE. YOU TALK AROUND THE GLOBE,

01:21:56 BUYING INVESTMENT-GRADE DEBT, YOU MAKE A DOUBLE DIGIT

01:21:58 RETURNED WITH THE COMPRESSION OF SPREADS AND OTHERWISE.

01:22:08 WE LEND TO LARGE COMPANIES AND

01:22:14 FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IS A 40 TRILLION OPPORTUNITY. LISA:

01:22:18 YOU HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON INVESTMENT GRADE WHICH IS

01:22:20 UNDERPERFORMED HIGH-YIELD.

01:22:26 WHERE ARE WE IN TERMS OF WHERE YOU CAN MAKE THE MOST MONEY?

01:22:32 JIM: IT'S IN HIGHER-QUALITY CREDIT.

01:22:39 YOU WILL HAVE A DEBATE LATER ON BUT WE ARE SHORT OF A

01:22:43 GOLDILOCKS. CONCERNED ABOUT A SLOWDOWN

01:22:47 WHICH IS BEEN ON EVERYONE'S MIND.

01:22:50 THE FED IS DONE A NICE JOB OF MAINTAINING HIGH RATES SO I

01:22:56 WOULD ARGUE THAT THE FED PUT US BACK IN THE MARKET AS PEOPLE

01:23:02 WORRY ABOUT SOFT AND HARD LANDING SEE ME MAKING DOUBLE

01:23:05 DIGIT RETURNS. LISA: DOES THAT MEAN WE WILL NOT HAVE

01:23:12 THE SAME CREDIT CYCLE? JIM: YOU WILL SEE AN ECONOMY WHERE

01:23:23 THERE WILL BE WINNERS AND LOSERS IN THE GHOSTS AREA WHERE

01:23:25 PRICES ARE LOWER BUT SERVICES ARE HIGHER.

01:23:31 AS THE ECONOMY NAVIGATES WHAT'S GOING ON THE FED HAS MAINTAINED

01:23:35 FAIRLY HIGH RATES IN THE MARKET HAS GOTTEN AHEAD OF IT IN THE

01:23:40 FED DOES HAVE A LOADED GUN THEY CAN USE AS NEEDED.

01:23:52 WE ARE STUDENTS OF HISTORY AND WE EXPECTED ANOTHER 2000 AND

01:23:56 EIGHT BUT I DON'T THINK WE WILL HAVE IT.

01:24:02 THERE ARE SCIENCE THAT ARE A BIT MORE CHALLENGING, A LOT OF

01:24:07 BUYOUTS BUT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO NAVIGATE IT WITH THE

01:24:08 BROAD TOOLBOX.

01:24:14 TOM:

01:24:21 WE HAD 73, 74 AND THEN WE HAD 1977.

01:24:25 IS THAT THE ANALOG RIGHT NOW?

01:24:35 JIM: IF YOU TALK ABOUT THE FOUR TAILWINDS I TALKED ABOUT

01:24:46 GLOBALIZATION, LOWER RATES, AND TECHNOLOGY.

01:24:50 WE ARE ON THE PRECIPICE WITH AI, COST STRUCTURE AND

01:24:52 EDUCATION, THAT CAN HAVE A HUGE IMPACT.

01:24:56 THE COST AND CAPITAL WILL BE HIGHER FOR THE NEXT FIVE-SEVEN

01:24:58 YEARS.

01:25:05 BACK TO YOUR ORIGINAL QUESTION, THE BANKING SYSTEM IS EVOLVING

01:25:07 IN THE U.S. IS IN FRONT OF THAT AND AS YOU

01:25:12 WILL HEAR ABOUT, WE THINK WE ARE AT THE PLAYER IS THAT

01:25:14 INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO EVOLVE.

01:25:21 JONATHAN: ARE WE NOT TRANSFERRING THE

01:25:25 RISKS FROM BANKS TO PLACES LIKE THIS? JIM:

01:25:34 WE TAKE THE RISKS CONSOLIDATED FROM FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND

01:25:36 BRINGING IT TO A BROADER SYSTEM WHERE WE ARE DIVERSIFYING THOSE

01:25:41 RISK. OUR INVESTORS ARE EITHER

01:25:44 SOVEREIGN OR PENSION FUNDS THE DOUBT ON THESE ASSETS ON

01:25:47 LEVERAGE OR OTHER RETIREMENT SERVICES.

01:25:53 WE GO WITH HIGHER-QUALITY ASSETS .

01:25:54 IT MAKES THE SYSTEM LESS RISKY. MANUS:

01:26:02 THAT WAS APOLLO CEO WITH THE ORIGINAL SURVEILLANCE TEAM.

01:26:09 WE HAVE THE ALTERNATE TEAM WITH US THIS MORNING.

01:26:14 CAROL AND KATIE. THE MOST SOBERING THING IS

01:26:18 GETTING USE TO A HIGHER COST OF CAPITAL.

01:26:22 WE ARE OBSESSED WITH THESE HUNDRED 50 BASIS POINTS OF CUTS.

01:26:30 BUT THE REALITY IS, THIS ECONOMY IS GOING TO FUNCTION AT

01:26:33 4%, 5%.

01:26:39 IT IS THE 26TH OF DECEMBER. IF YOU ARE WAKING UP

01:26:47 BLEARY-EYED, YOUR EQUITY MARKET CONTINUES TO BE UPBEAT.

01:26:58 WILL THE ECB GO FOR A RATE CUT AROUND THE SAME TIME AS THE FED?

01:27:04 YIELDS TRADE AT 3.900. YOU HAVE AN EXTREME POSITIONING

01:27:09 ON THE BOND MARKET AND YOU COULD GET A LITTLE BIT OF AN

01:27:15 DECEPTION -- INDIGESTION.

01:27:30 1.10 EURO TO DOLLAR. YOU HAVE A MOVEMENT OF SHIPS

01:27:38 AWAY FROM THE RED SEA AFTER THE ATTACKS OF HOUTHI REBELS.

01:27:46 KATIE: OIL HAS HAD A FEW WEEKLY GAINS

01:27:49 BUT OVERALL, IT HAS BEEN AHEAD SCRATCHER THIS YEAR OVER THE

01:27:52 PAST FEW MONTHS. CAROL: WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS?

01:27:59 KATIE: IT COMES BACK TO THE SUPPLY

01:28:04 PICTURE. MANUS: YOU HAVE THE U.S.

01:28:09 PUMPING OIL AND NON-OPEC SUPPLY AND THEN ANGOLA LEAVES THE OPEC

01:28:10 FAMILY.

01:28:17 CAROL: I FEEL LIKE THE CONVERSATION IS

01:28:20 CHANGING. MANUS:

01:28:31 COMING UP, MADISON MILLER ON

01:28:47 >> IT IS ALL ABOUT DATA, IT'S THE DATA.

01:28:52 WE THOUGHT THE MARKET WOULD BE 90 BILLION ALTOGETHER.

01:28:56 RIGHT NOW THE MARKET LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE BIGGER.

01:29:04 IT'S A SIZABLE OPPORTUNITY. MANUS: THAT WAS THE PFIZER CEO

01:29:10 SPEAKING TO US ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR WEIGHT LOSS DRUGS.

01:29:18 AND WOW, DID THAT MOVE THE MARKETS.

01:29:21 LET'S TAKE A QUICK SNAPSHOT OF WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE

01:29:27 MARKETS. HOW MUCH LIQUIDITY IS IN THERE?

01:29:30 CAROL: AS WE WRAP UP 2023, IT WILL BE

01:29:34 QUIET. THERE ARE A TON OF PEOPLE FLYING.

01:29:41 KATIE: NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE TO

01:29:42 PARTICIPATE IN THE EQUITY MARKET.

01:29:46 IT IS DECEMBER 26 BUT WE ARE HERE.

01:29:48 WE ARE WATCHING THE MARKETS AND INTERESTING TO SEE HOW WE

01:29:52 FINISH THIS ERA. SINCE LATE OCTOBER, IT IS BEEN

01:29:57 OFF TO THE RACES. BUT IT FEELS LIKE MAYBE WE HAVE

01:30:01 REACHED A SETTLING POINT, AND EQUILIBRIUM. MANUS:

01:30:06 THERE ARE 6 TRILLION AND MONEY MARKET FUNDS.

01:30:10 IF THOSE RATE CUTS COME THROUGH, THE MAJORITY WILL ROLL

01:30:14 OFF.

01:30:27 MAYBE THERE IS SOME KIND OF PRECIPICE. KATIE:

01:30:30 OR DOESN'T IT GO BACK TO BANKS? WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE FLOW

01:30:39 OF TRAVEL OUT OF MARKET FUNDS, WHERE'S THE FLOW OF TRAVEL?

01:30:42 CAROL: IF YOU LOOK AT RSI, WE ARE

01:30:43 OVERBOUGHT.

01:30:44 KATIE: REMEMBER WHEN WE HAD A ONE

01:30:55 HICCUP.

01:30:57 IT WAS TRIGGERED IN THE LAST HOUR OF TRADING.

01:31:03 BUT THE TECHNICAL START TO COME INTO PLAY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT

01:31:04 THE SYNDICATORS. CAROL: I THINK ABOUT ALL OF THE

01:31:08 COMPANIES AND NAMES INVOLVED IN THE NEW CLASS OF WEIGHT LOSS

01:31:12 DRUG. TWO STOCKS POSTING DOUBLE DIGIT

01:31:15 GAINS.

01:31:25 NOVO NORDISK AND ELI LILLY THINGS TO THE POPULARITY OF

01:31:28 WEIGHT LOSS DRUGS.

01:31:37 THESE WERE TO VERY IMPORTANT SECTORS WHEN IT CAME TO MARKET

01:31:38 ACTIVITY.

01:31:45 FOR MORE, SHE HAS BEEN ALL OVER THIS MADISON.

01:31:48 I'VE ALWAYS ENJOYED OUR CONVERSATION SO WE LEARN SO

01:31:51 MUCH WHEN WE TALK TO YOU. WE HEARD THE HEAD OF PFIZER

01:31:55 TALKING ABOUT THE MARKET.

01:32:03 HOW BIG POTENTIALLY ARE THIS CLASS OF WEIGHT LOSS DRUGS

01:32:05 COULD BE?

01:32:06 ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S NOT JUST WEIGHT LOSS BUT OTHER IMPORTANT

01:32:15 HEALTH PROBLEMS?

01:32:17 MADISON: WHEN WE HEAR JUST ABOUT WEIGHT

01:32:22 LOSS WE HEAR 100 BILLION BY 2030.

01:32:25 THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY WHEN IT COMES TO OBESITY TREATMENT.

01:32:32 THAT'S NOT EVEN BAKING IN THESE OTHER USES, KIDNEY OR LIVER

01:32:35 DISEASE OR ALCOHOL ABUSE DISORDER.

01:32:39 THESE DRUGS COULD HAVE OTHER USES BEYOND WEIGHT LOSS.

01:32:46 THIS MARKET COULD REALLY ONLY GROW AND THAT REMAINS TO BE

01:32:47 SEEN HOW BIG IT COULD GET. KATIE:

01:32:53 IT FEELS LIKE THERE ARE TONS OF CHEERLEADERS WHEN IT COMES TO

01:32:58 THESE DRUGS, WHAT ARE THE CONCERNS AS YOU CONTINUE TO

01:33:00 COVER IT?

01:33:06 MADISON: THERE ARE CONCERNS WITH SIDE

01:33:10 EFFECTS AND CONTINUATION OF USAGE.

01:33:14 WE SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE STOPPED TAKING THE JUDGE -- DRUG ONCE

01:33:23 THEY ACHIEVE THEIR GOAL AND INSURANCE ISSUES PREVENTS

01:33:28 PEOPLE GET COVERAGE SO THEY DISCONTINUE USING THE DRUG.

01:33:33 THAT'S ONE OF THE BIG CONCERNS AS LONG-TERM USAGE AND HOW THAT

01:33:42 WILL PLAY OUT.

01:33:44 WE ARE STARTING TO SEE , THERE IS NOT AS MUCH

01:33:51 EXCITEMENT GOING INTO THE NEXT YEAR AND WE SEE A SHIFT TO ELI

01:33:56 LILLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE AN EXCITING PIPELINE OF NEXT

01:33:57 GENERATION COMING ALONG.

01:34:03 THERE IS A DRUG THAT HAS SHOWN 30% WEIGHT LOSS WHICH IS LIKE

01:34:07 BARIATRIC SURGERY.

01:34:13 NOVO NORDISK DOES NOT HAVE AS MUCH IN THE NEAR TERM.

01:34:18 THERE ARE NOT AS MANY BIG DATA READOUTS.

01:34:28 WE ARE SEEING LESS EXCITEMENT GOING INTO 2024. MANUS:

01:34:35 WHERE ARE WE WITH HAIRCARE COVERAGE ON THESE DRUGS?

01:34:39 THAT IS SOMETHING I PRESUME CHANGES THE GAME MATERIALLY

01:34:43 AGAIN IN TERMS OF THE SIZE OF THE MARKET? MADISON:

01:34:47 THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE OF THIS.

01:34:50 COVERAGE IS STILL SPOTTY AND MEDICARE DOES NOT COVER THESE

01:34:55 DRUGS. WE SEE MORE MEDICAID PROGRAMS

01:34:58 COVER THE DRUGS.

01:35:06 I AM IN CHICAGO AND ILLINOIS DECIDED TO COVER WEIGHT LOSS

01:35:10 DRUGS SO WE WILL SEE MORE AND MORE COVERAGE IN TERMS OF

01:35:19 MEDICAID.

01:35:20 MEDICARE IS A PIECE OF THIS THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT WILL

01:35:27 BUDGE. WITH COMMERCIAL PLANS IT DEPENDS ON THE PLAN.

01:35:32 THE COMPANIES ARE LOBBYING SUBSTANTIALLY TO GET INSURANCE

01:35:36 TO COVER THESE DRUGS. MANUS:

01:35:38 WITHOUT INSURANCE NARRATIVE, WHAT DOES THAT DO POTENTIALLY

01:35:41 TO THE MARGIN OF THESE PRODUCTS? I THINK OF THE PRICES OF

01:35:59 OZEMPIC IS 50% CHEAPER IN THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES.

01:36:00 WHERE ARE WE WITH MARGINS AS A RESULT? MADISON:

01:36:09 THE REBATES ARE HELPING/THE PRICE FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE

01:36:10 INSURANCE COVERAGE. THEY WILL BE PAYING 1000 A

01:36:15 MONTH AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT COMES UP IS THAT IN OTHER

01:36:25 COUNTRIES THESE DRUGS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY CHEAPER.

01:36:33 THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WILL

01:36:39 CONTINUE TO BE A CONVERSATION IN THIS MORE COMPANIES ENTER

01:36:41 THIS MARKET ARE MORE PRODUCTS BECOME AVAILABLE THERE IS THE

01:36:47 ASSUMPTION THAT THE PRICE OF DRUGS ACROSS THE BOARD WILL

01:36:51 COME DOWN. THEY ARE HOPING MORE

01:36:53 COMPETITION WILL ENTER THE MARKET IN ORDER TO BRING DOWN

01:36:56 THE PRICE OF THESE DRUGS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE

01:36:57 EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE. KATIE:

01:36:59 SOMETHING THAT IS PLA GUED THESE COMPANIES IS SUPPLY

01:37:06 SHORTAGE. WHERE DO WE STAND ON THAT STORY?

01:37:13 MADISON:

01:37:20 NOVO NORDISK CONTINUES TO LIMIT NEW PRESCRIPTIONS.

01:37:27 THERE SUPPLY ISSUES HAVE PLAGUED THE COMPANY THIS YEAR.

01:37:31 ELI LILLY HAS A BETTER HANDLE ON IT.

01:37:41 ALL OF THE DOSAGES ARE IN SUPPLY RIGHT NOW.

01:37:46 BUT THEIR CFO HAS TOLD ME THEY CONTINUE TO SEE TIGHT SUPPLY

01:37:51 GOING INTO 2024. BOTH COMPANIES ARE INVESTED IN

01:37:56 RAMPING UP HEAVILY.

01:38:02 CAROL: COVID, DO WE EVEN TALK ABOUT IT?

01:38:06 I HAD ANOTHER ROUND OF COVID LAST WEEK?

01:38:11 IS THAT SOMETHING WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT?

01:38:12 MADISON: WE SEE CASES RISE ACROSS THE

01:38:17 U.S.. I'VE READ ABOUT PEOPLE GETTING

01:38:18 IT AGAIN AS WELL. THERE IS A VARIANCE SIMILAR TO

01:38:22 ONES WE HAVE SEEN. IT IS STILL AROUND AND IT IS

01:38:26 IMPORTANT. CAROL:

01:38:28 WE SO APPRECIATED, MADISON MULLER WHO COVERS EVERYTHING IN

01:38:40 HEALTH CARE.

01:38:43 FUTURES ARE UP .1 1%. THE 10 YEAR 3.8986.

01:39:08 >> THE SIGNS ARE THAT THE INFLATION DYNAMICS HAVE REALLY

01:39:10 EXITED THE PANDEMIC.

01:39:14 >> WE CAN ENJOY MODEST GROWTH THAN IT SUGGESTS THE LAST MILE

01:39:16 MAY NOT BE OVERLY DIFFICULT.

01:39:20 >> THIS IMMACULATE DISINFLATION IS WHAT WE'VE HAD.

01:39:24 >> IN TERMS OF JOBS CRACKING INFLATION AND COLLAPSING, IT'S

01:39:29 NOT THERE IN THE DATA.

01:39:31 >> IF I DESCRIBED 2023, BETTER THAN FEARED.

01:39:34 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE. LISA:

01:39:38 A VERY GOOD MORNING FROM NEW YORK CITY FOR OUR AUDIENCES

01:39:47 WORLDWIDE. THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE.

01:39:50 CAROL: WE ARE IN FOR JOHN, TOM AND

01:39:51 LISETTE. IT'S EXPECTED TO BE VERY QUIET

01:39:56 BECAUSE OF THE HOLIDAYS BUT WE ARE GETTING READY TO WRAP UP

01:39:59 2023. LET'S SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

01:40:01 TERMS OF THE MARKET. TAKE A LOOK AT FUTURES BECAUSE

01:40:07 WE HAVE HAD QUITE A RUN WHEN IT COMES TO THE S&P 500.

01:40:11 WE ARE JUST UP ABOUT 5.5 POINTS. LOOKING AT THE 10 YEAR, 390 SO

01:40:19 A LITTLE BIT OF MOVEMENT THERE.

01:40:28 NEW YORK CRUDE, CONCERNS ABOUT MIDEAST TENSIONS SO WE'RE

01:40:31 WATCHING IT WHICH IS UP ABOUT 1% SO IT'S BUILDING STRENGTH TO

01:40:34 THE UPSIDE AS WE WORK OUR WAY THROUGH THE MORNING.

01:40:41 HAVING SAID THAT, IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE I FEEL

01:40:43 THERE WAS A LOT ABOUT THE SANTA CLAUS RALLY WE HAVE SEEN THIS

01:40:44 YEAR.

01:40:50 CRAIG JOHNSON OF PIPER SANDLER SAID SINCE 1928, THE MARKET HAS

01:40:55 RALLIED AN AVERAGE OF 1.7% BETWEEN THE LAST FIVE DAYS OF

01:40:57 SEPTEMBER AND THE FIRST TWO DAYS OF THE NEW YEAR.

01:41:04 MANUS: THAT SOUNDS GREAT. KATIE: IT'S EASY TO MAKE FUN OF THE

01:41:11 SANTA CLAUS RALLY BUT YOU THINK ABOUT THIS PERIOD EVERY YEAR

01:41:16 WHICH SEEMS TO BE PRETTY GOOD EXCEPT FOR LAST YEAR. MANUS:

01:41:22 SOME OF THE POSITIONING IS SETTING THE STAGE FOR 2024.

01:41:27 POSITIONING IN THE LONG BOND IS EXTREMELY LONG.

01:41:34 HOW MUCH OF THAT MOVE IS ALREADY PRICED IN?

01:41:44 THEY ALSO SAID GET READY FOR A LITTLE BIT OF INDIGESTION.

01:41:56 KATIE: IT FEELS LIKE THERE HAD BEEN A

01:41:58 FIGHT AGAINST THE FED AND THE MARKET PROBABLY ONE BECAUSE

01:42:03 HOWELL WAS WAY MORE DOVISH THAN EXPECTED BUT HEADING INTO NEXT

01:42:08 YEAR, THIS BIG GAP BETWEEN WHAT'S IN THE DOT AND WHAT THE

01:42:12 MARKET HAS, I DON'T KNOW WHO WINS THAT FIGHT. CAROL:

01:42:16 WHAT PEOPLE WERE SAYING AT THE BEGINNING OF LAST YEAR IN TERMS

01:42:19 OF WHAT KIND OF MARKET AND MANY PEOPLE GOT IT WRONG. MANUS:

01:42:24 SHE WANTS TO COME BACK TOMORROW. KATIE:

01:42:31 CAROL: A LOT OF THINGS GOT THROWN AT

01:42:33 US THAT NOBODY ANTICIPATED AND IT'S A REMINDER THAT WE ARE

01:42:37 LIVING WHERE THINGS ARE HAPPENING OVERSEAS, SERIOUS

01:42:40 STUFF THAT CAN CHANGE SENTIMENT AND MARKET REALITY AND

01:42:43 FUNDAMENTALS IN A SNAP. MANUS: WE'RE ALL WAITING TO SEE

01:42:46 WHETHER THE DISINFLATION STORY ACCELERATES.

01:42:49 I'M NOT SAYING THERE'S A RISK OF DEFLATION BUT IT'S HOW MUCH

01:42:55 OF A MORE MATERIAL PROGRESSION OF THE DISINFLATION STORY

01:42:59 CONTINUES. PCE CAME IN SUB 2% AND THAT'S

01:43:02 IMPORTANT FROM THE DATA. WHAT ARE WE?

01:43:05 WE ARE DATA-DEPENDENT. WE'VE GOT THE MEMORIES OF

01:43:09 GOLDFISH. CAROL: THAT'S WHY OUR PRODUCERS ARE

01:43:13 BUYING US SOME COFFEE.

01:43:20 CHIEF AND JUST MEANT STRATEGIST FROM JOHN HANCOCK IS JOINING US.

01:43:26 THERE IS A LOT THAT COULD COME OUT OF THE NEW YEAR BUT AS YOU

01:43:31 LOOK BACK AT THIS YEAR, ARE THERE NARRATIVES YOU THINK WILL

01:43:34 CARRY OVER INTO NEXT YEAR?

01:43:36 >> THANK YOU. THE LAST TWO MONTHS TO FIND

01:43:40 2020 FREE MARKETS.

01:43:46 IT WAS REALLY AROUND JAY POWELL'S PIVOT SO IN SEPTEMBER,

01:43:49 THEY FORECAST ANOTHER RATE HIKE IN DECEMBER.

01:43:53 NO RATE CUTS INTO 2024 AND THAT CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY.

01:44:00 IN NOVEMBER, HE WENT TO NO HIKE IN DECEMBER AND IN DECEMBER,

01:44:01 REALLY PIVOTED. IT ALMOST LOOK LIKE A TRAVEL

01:44:08 GEAR WHERE THE PIVOT FOOT MOVED BECAUSE POWELL DID A 180 FROM

01:44:11 HIS TONE IN SEPTEMBER TO NOVEMBER.

01:44:15 I LOOK AT SMALL-CAP STOCKS IN PARTICULAR AS THE BIGGEST

01:44:19 BENEFICIARY, DOWN 5% ON THE YEAR BEFORE NOVEMBER 1 AND

01:44:24 RIGHT NOW THEY ARE UP 17% YEAR TO DATE.

01:44:29 SMALL CAPS ARE LOOKING THE HIGHEST THIS MORNING. CAROL:

01:44:31 TALK ABOUT A 180.

01:44:33 >> EXACTLY. MANUS: DO YOU THINK THAT'S WHERE WE GO

01:44:36 NEXT?

01:44:44 THE S&P 500, 23% UP ON THE YEAR. MORE THAN 50% OF THE MOVE WAS

01:44:52 DONE IN THE LAST TWO MONTHS AND YOU SAY THE OPTIMISM IS ALREADY

01:44:53 BAKED INTO STOCKS. THE MATH FOR YOU IS NOT

01:44:58 COMPELLING.

01:45:04 THERE IS THE RUSSELL, UP OVER THE PAST TWO MONTHS 22%.

01:45:08 THE MATH NOT BEING COMPELLING, DO I STALL OR DRAW DOWN?

01:45:13 DO WE SHATTER IN JANUARY BECAUSE THE BOND MARKET IS

01:45:17 CONVINCED WE ARE ON SLICE AND DICE FROM THE FED?

01:45:21 >> THE RUSSELL 2000 EARNINGS ARE DOWN 17% THIS YEAR.

01:45:27 ONE OF THE ONES I LOVE THE MOST IS TECHNOLOGY AND CAROL WAS

01:45:28 TALKING ABOUT EARNINGS AND I LOVE EARNINGS AS WELL BUT

01:45:32 TECHNOLOGY EARNINGS ARE UP ABOUT 5% THIS YEAR, THAT'S NOT

01:45:33 BAD. THAT FEEDS MOST OF THE WORLD

01:45:36 AND EARNINGS.

01:45:42 COMPANIES ARE UP PRICEWISE, 55% SO THAT SHOWS YOU HOW MUCH THIS

01:45:44 HAS BEEN MULTIPLE EXPANSION VERSUS EARNINGS.

01:45:46 IT'S ALL ABOUT POWELL THIS YEAR. I DON'T THINK NEXT YEAR WILL BE

01:45:54 THAT MEANINGFUL AS IT RELATES TO EVERYTHING WITH THE FED.

01:46:00 FUNDAMENTALS WILL METAL -- MATTER MORE AND ECONOMIC DATA

01:46:02 WILL MATTER MORE IN THE FED IS IN ITS OPPOSITION BECAUSE THE

01:46:07 SOFT DATA, YOU HAD TO FOCUS ON THE HARD DATA.

01:46:11 THE HARD DATA LEGS THE SOFT DATA SO THEY HAVE TO WAIT.

01:46:17 THEY WILL WAIT ON THAT AND I THINK THEY WILL HAVE TO WAIT

01:46:20 UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE TO CUT AND THAT MAY BE TOO LATE AND

01:46:23 THEY WILL HAVE TO CUT MORE AGGRESSIVELY THAN THE MARKET

01:46:26 THANKS. KATIE: I DON'T LIKE EARNINGS, I LIKE

01:46:27 TALKING ABOUT THE MACRO. YOU SEEN EQUITIES REALLY BE

01:46:34 DRIVEN BY THE MACRO EVEN AT THE SINGLE STOCK LEVEL.

01:46:37 I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENT PSYCHOLOGY BETWEEN

01:46:38 THE EQUITY MARKET AND THE BOND MARKET.

01:46:44 YOUR NOTES AS STOCKS OR STORIES AND BONDS ARE MAPS.

01:46:45 WHAT DO YOU MEAN THERE?

01:46:50 >> WITH THE BOND MARKET, IT WILL BE YOUR INCOME AND INCOME

01:46:53 RIGHT NOW, EVEN THOUGH IT'S CHANGED A LOT IN THE LAST

01:46:58 COUPLE OF MONTHS, WE WERE UP FIVE-6% IN HIGH-QUALITY BONDS

01:47:00 WHICH IS AMAZING. WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THESE

01:47:04 LEVELS FOR YEARS AND FINALLY WE ARE GETTING IT.

01:47:07 IT STILL FOUR OR 5%. WE THINK THAT IS AN INCOME

01:47:11 STREAM WHERE YOU CAN DEPEND ON THAT IN HIGH-QUALITY BONDS WILL

01:47:14 BE AN ATTRACTIVE STREAM INTO NEXT YEAR.

01:47:18 $6 TRILLION IN MONEY MARKETS ON THE SIDELINES, WHAT WILL THAT

01:47:24 YOU'LL BE LIKE NEXT YEAR?

01:47:27 IF IT'S FIVE NOW, IT COULD BE DOWN TO THREE OR 4%.

01:47:31 WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE VARIABLE INTEREST STREAMS, WE WANT A

01:47:34 FIXED MOVEMENT AND THAT'S ABOUT THE MATH.

01:47:38 WE LIKE THE FACTUAL PART OF THAT.

01:47:42 STOCKS RIGHT NOW LOOK LIKE YOUR HIGH EARNINGS ESTIMATES AND

01:47:47 SENTIMENT IS ALL ABOUT SOFT LANDING AND THAT COULD CHANGE

01:47:48 QUICKLY INTO NEXT YEAR. KATIE:

01:47:54 WE'VE BEEN BATTING THIS AROUND ALL MORNING.

01:47:58 WHERE DOES THE MONEY BELONG, THE CASH THAT'S COME INTO MONEY

01:48:03 MARKET FUNDS. WHEN IT COMES OUTCOME IS THAT

01:48:06 -- DOES THAT BELONG TO RISK ASSETS OR IS IT STICKIER THAN

01:48:07 USUAL?

01:48:12 >> WHAT WE LOOKED AT WHEN WE SAW MONEY MARKET ASSETS LIKE

01:48:15 THIS BEFORE, WE TRENDED AND WE SEE MONEY MARKET ASSETS USUALLY

01:48:17 RISE GOING INTO A RECESSION. THEY ACCELERATE AND EVERYBODY

01:48:22 SELLS RIGHT AT THE LOW OF THE MARKET.

01:48:27 THE PEAK IN MONEY MARKET ASSETS IS THE TROUGH OF THE S&P 500.

01:48:32 IT HAPPENED IN 2008 AND 2020 AND NOW WE ARE BUILDING.

01:48:39 WE THINK IT FINDS A HOME IN A BALANCED PORTFOLIO WITH STOCKS

01:48:46 AND BONDS.

01:48:47 BONDS HAVE SOME INFLUENCE THIS YEAR, 100 BILLION DOLLARS

01:48:48 TAXABLE INCOME AND THAT'S THE HIGHEST OUTSIDE OF MONEY

01:48:51 MARKETS BUT IS STILL A FRACTION OF WHAT MONEY MARKETS DO IN

01:48:54 FIXED INCOME. WE ARE NOT SEEING THE OVERLY

01:49:00 AGGRESSIVE BONDS SENTIMENT. WE HEAR INVESTORS WHO ARE STILL

01:49:05 PRETTY CAUTIOUS AND THEY SAY WE WILL WAIT UNTIL NEXT YEAR TO

01:49:06 BUY BONDS. HIGH YIELDS MOVE REALLY FAST,

01:49:11 FASTER THAN USUAL AND WE DON'T WANT THOSE YIELDS TO GO AWAY.

01:49:16 CAROL: FOR SUCH A BIG TIME, WITH THE

01:49:22 BOND MARKET, WE'RE SEEING WHAT IT CONTINUE SO WHY NOT LOCK IT

01:49:32 IN?

01:49:32 YOU ARE LOOKING AT YOUR 401(K) AND SAYING WOW.

01:49:37 YOU LOOK AT THE EQUITY RETURNS AND A LOT OF IT WAS THE SECOND

01:49:42 HALF OF THE YEAR AND JUST IN THE LAST MONTH OR TWO.

01:49:48 HOW DO YOU JUSTIFY THE BOND STORY WHEN YOU CAN GET MANY

01:49:50 TIMES OVER INTO AN INDEX FUND?

01:49:55 >> I HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND THEY SAY

01:50:00 HOW LONG DO I HOLD THESE BONDS? I WILL GO ALL IN ON AIA OR

01:50:02 WHATEVER.

01:50:08 IT BECAUSE BACK TO BEHAVIORAL FINANCE PRINCIPLES WE LEARN

01:50:11 ABOUT WHEN YOU ALWAYS WANT TO HAVE THAT THING THAT'S

01:50:12 PERFORMING THE BEST AND SELL THE THING THAT'S DOWN THE MOST

01:50:15 IN YOUR PORTFOLIO. TO US IT'S ABOUT REBALANCING AT

01:50:21 TIMES LIKE THIS WHEN YOU HAVE A HUGE RUN IN STOCKS VERSUS

01:50:25 BONDS, A MORE DISCIPLINED APPROACH.

01:50:29 WE ARE LOOKING TO REBALANCE AND TRIM SOME RISK INTO NEXT YEAR.

01:50:33 WE THINK A LOT OF THE RUN UP HAS BEEN BUILT INTO THE EQUITY

01:50:38 SIDE PORTFOLIOS AND WE WANT TO REBUILD THAT INTO

01:50:41 HIGHER-QUALITY FIXED INCOME AND GET THAT INCOME STREAM INTO

01:50:44 NEXT YEAR. THAT'S HOW WE WOULD LOOK AT IT.

01:50:46 CAROL: SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE IN

01:50:48 TERMS OF BALANCED PORTFOLIOS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF BOND

01:50:50 MARKETS IN YOUR STRATEGY. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND HAPPY NEW

01:50:53 YEAR. WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME ON THIS

01:50:57 TUESDAY. WE ARE LOOKING AT A MARKET

01:51:01 THAT'S STILL QUIET. CRUDE OIL IS 1.5% HIGHER.

01:51:09 WE'VE SEEN THE MOMENTUM BUILD FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS AND THERE

01:51:12 ARE CONCERNS OVER THE MIDDLE

01:51:20 EAST. S&P FUTURES ARE UP 0.1%. WE WILL BE WATCHING THE BROADER

01:51:25 MARKET WE WILL ALSO BE TALKING ABOUT RETAIL WHICH IS HAVE SOME

01:51:28 SIGNIFICANT OUTPERFORMANCE IN 2023.

01:51:32 NOT ALL RETAIL IS A LIKE SO COMING UP, WE WILL TALK WITH

01:51:36 DANA TELSEY ON THIS YEAR'S HOLIDAY SHOPPING.

01:51:42 COMING INTO THIS YEAR ON NEW YEAR'S EVE, RETAILERS WERE

01:51:49 CLOSED. I FEEL LIKE PRE-PANDEMIC DAYS

01:51:53 ARE GOING WHEN EVERYTHING WAS OPEN THANKSGIVING EVENING UNTIL

01:51:54 THE BITTER END ON CHRISTMAS EVE. IT FEELS LIKE A DIFFERENT TIME.

01:51:58 KATIE: IT'S ALSO WHERE PEOPLE ARE

01:52:01 SHOPPING BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE GOING TO THOSE

01:52:04 DOORS OF THE LAST MINUTE. THEY WOULD PROBABLY BE ONLINE.

01:52:07 THAT WAS THE STORY OF THE THANKSGIVING HOLIDAY SHOPPING

01:52:09 THIS YEAR, THE AMOUNT OF DOLLARS BEING SPENT ONLINE.

01:52:14 THAT'S WHERE I ALMOST ENTIRELY DO MY SHOPPING. MANUS:

01:52:19 I HELPED THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IN A VARIETY OF WAYS THIS YEAR.

01:52:24 SHOPPERS SPEND $1 TRILLION ON CREDIT CARDS.

01:52:32 $48 BILLION ADDED TO THE THIRD QUARTER ON THE EXTEND AND

01:52:33 PRETEND. KATIE: BY NOW PAY LATER IS A BIG STORY

01:52:37 THIS YEAR AS WELL. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WHEN THEY

01:52:40 HAD TO PAY LATER? MANUS: THAT THE IRISH VERSION OF

01:52:45 PRETEND TRADE. CAROL: THEY DO THAT KNOWING THEY HAVE

01:52:48 A FEW WEEKS OR A FEW MONTHS TO PAY WHEN THE INTEREST RATES

01:52:51 START TO KICK IN. THEY ARE POSITIVE THEY CAN PAY

01:52:54 IT.

01:53:10 >> IF YOU LOOK BACK OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR, IT IS

01:53:14 REALLY STARTING MUCH PROGRESS THE ECONOMY HAS MADE.

01:53:18 INFLATION HAS COME DOWN FASTER THAN EVEN THE MORE OPTIMISTIC

01:53:23 FORECASTS AND GROWTH HAS REMAIN VERY RESILIENT.

01:53:27 IF YOU RECALL A YEAR AGO, THE CONSENSUS PROJECTION WAS THAT

01:53:31 GETTING INFLATION DOWN WOULD REQUIRE A SPIKE IN UNEMPLOYMENT

01:53:37 AND A RECESSION. CAROL:

01:53:40 THAT'S LAEL BRAINARD, THE ECONOMIC COUNCIL DIRECTOR

01:53:41 SPEAKING ON FRIDAY. IN TERMS OF HOW THE

01:53:47 ADMINISTRATION SEES THE ECONOMY FROM FED SPEAKERS, WE ARE

01:53:51 EXPECTING AN AGGRESSIVE RATE CUTTING FED IN 2024.

01:53:56 THAT SEEMS TO BE BUILT-IN BUT WHAT HAPPENS IS THERE IS

01:54:00 ECONOMIC DATA AND GEOPOLITICAL AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE WERE

01:54:01 REMINDED OF THIS MORNING. KATIE: IT MATTERS CHIEFLY FOR

01:54:06 INVESTORS. YOU HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN IT IN

01:54:10 OIL BUT MAYBE IN THE PAST WEEK OR SO.

01:54:14 YOU ARE STARTING TO SEE CRUDE PRICE AND SOME OF THE

01:54:16 GEOPOLITICAL RISKS WE KNOW ARE MULTIPLYING.

01:54:22 CAROL: LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT CRUDE OIL

01:54:24 BECAUSE THERE IS MOMENTUM TO THE UPSIDE.

01:54:29 YOU SEE THE TRADE IN REAL-TIME CONTINUE TO EDGE HIGHER.

01:54:31 A SIGNIFICANT MOVE. THE U.S.

01:54:37 MILITARY LAUNCHED STRIKES ON THREE LOCATIONS IN IRAQ

01:54:40 TARGETING WHAT'S SAID TO BE A TERRORIST GROUP BACKED BY IRAN.

01:54:43 WE ARE WATCHING WHAT'S GOING ON THE MIDDLE EAST. WE HAVE THE

01:54:47 FORMER SENIOR U.S. INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL AND

01:54:52 SENIOR ADVISOR OF THE TRANSITIONAL THREAT PROJECT

01:54:54 JOINING US ON THIS TUESDAY. WHAT DO WE NEED TO BE THINKING

01:54:59 ABOUT AS WE CONTINUE TO WATCH HEADLINES AND WHAT SEEMS TO BE

01:55:02 ESCALATION OF THE MIDDLE EAST CONFLICT?

01:55:05 >> GOOD MORNING. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS TO

01:55:08 MOVE SEEN A MULTI-FRONT ESCALATION IN THE REGION.

01:55:12 HAVE THE ISRAELIS MOVING FROM A HOLDING PATTERN OF NORTH GAZA

01:55:17 TO AREAS WHICH ARE THE MOST DIFFICULT AND CHALLENGING

01:55:21 ASPECT OF THE WAR. JUST THE LOCATION OF THE HAMAS

01:55:25 LEADERSHIP AND A VAST ARRAY OF TUNNELS, PERHAPS TWICE AS MANY

01:55:26 AS ANTICIPATED. WE'VE SEEN THE ATTACKS BY U.S.

01:55:30 FORCES IN THE U.S. RESPONSE AGAINST THREE SITES IN

01:55:32 IRAQ. THAT IS DEMONSTRATING A

01:55:38 CAPACITY FOR RETALIATION BUT NOT NECESSARILY TO TERRENCE.

01:55:44 WE'VE SEEN THE IS REALLY -- THE ISRAELI KILLING OF THE MOST

01:55:47 SENIOR I RAMY OFFICIAL. HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

01:55:55 SHIPMENT OF IRANIAN WEAPONS AND HIS DEATH WILL REQUIRE SOME

01:55:57 SORT OF IRANIAN RETALIATION. WE'VE ALSO SEEN SOME MODEST

01:56:02 CONTINUED ACTION BY THE WHO THESE AGAINST SHIPPING IN THE

01:56:05 RED SEA.

01:56:11 THAT'S BEEN SET WITH A VARIETY OF SHIPPING.

01:56:18 MANUS: THE COALITION OF UP TO 20 COUNTRIES CONTINUE.

01:56:21 I THINK THAT IS QUITE PROGRESSIVE.

01:56:27 YOU WERE THE PRINCIPAL INTELLIGENCE OFFICER OVERSEEING

01:56:31 NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE POLICY ON IRAN.

01:56:35 I SAT DOWN WITH THE IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER WHEN HE WAS

01:56:38 HERE AT THE YOU AND AND I ASKED HIM ABOUT SCALING UP IN TERMS

01:56:41 OF TROOPS AND SHIPS? HE PREVARICATE IT AND ACCUSED

01:56:46 ME OF INTERROGATING HIM RATHER THAN INTERVIEWING HIM.

01:56:52 WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHERE IRANIAN PROXIES ARE, WHERE ARE THE

01:56:55 WEAKEST LINKS FOR THE COALITION OF THE WEST? IS IT IN LEBANON?

01:57:02 IS THAT THIS ONE OFF REPRISAL FROM THE U.S. INTO IRAQ?

01:57:06 WHERE IS THE WEAKEST LINK FOR THE COALITION AT THE MOMENT?

01:57:12 >> THE MOST IMPORTANT AREA FOR FOCUS I CONTINUE TO BELIEVE

01:57:13 WOULD BE THE RED SEA. WE HAVE TO WATCH FOR THE

01:57:20 POSSIBILITY OF HOUTHIS USING STRONG BOATS AND MINING AND

01:57:23 BELIEVING THE RETALIATORY CAPACITY OF THE COALITION IS

01:57:26 WEAK BECAUSE IT IS UNTESTED. THE U.S.

01:57:30 IS NOW NOT USED TO AN ESCALATION OF REGIONAL

01:57:34 CONFLICTS. I WOULD LOOK THEREFORE A RESULT

01:57:37 FROM THE PROXIES. WE HAVE A LEBANESE SOLDIERS AND

01:57:42 ONE SOLDIER DIED TODAY. THE LEBANESE HAS BELOW APPEARS

01:57:47 TO BE CONSTRAINED BY ITS OWN PERCEPTION THAT IT DOESN'T WANT

01:57:51 TO BE INVOLVED IN A CONFLICT THAT COULD BRING STRATEGIC

01:57:54 DAMAGE TO ITS OWN EQUITIES. KATIE:

01:57:58 SINCE OCTOBER 7, THE GUIDING THOUGHT HAS BEEN THE

01:58:01 ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNMENTS WORLDWIDE DON'T WANT THAT TO

01:58:04 BROADEN INTO A WIDER CONFLICT. YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENED

01:58:08 OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS WITH THE RED SEA AND NOW THESE DRONE

01:58:11 ATTACKS IN IRAQ. IS THAT STARTING TO LOOK

01:58:13 INEVITABLE?

01:58:18 >> THE POSTURE OF OPPOSING AN EXPANSION OF THE CONFLICT IS

01:58:22 INEVITABLY ERODING. THE DETERRENT CAPACITY OF THE

01:58:28 INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND COLLECTIVE SECURITY, IRAN'S

01:58:29 PROXIES ARE TESTING REDLINES. THEY SAY SUMMER PINK AND THEY

01:58:34 ARE NORMALIZING A CERTAIN SCALE OF VIOLENCE.

01:58:37 THERE WAS A TIME WHEN MEDIUM-RANGE BALLISTIC MISSILE

01:58:39 SHOT FROM YEMEN TO ISRAEL WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN AS SPARKING A

01:58:44 REGIONAL CONFLICT AND NOW IT DOESN'T MAKE THE NEWS AFTER A

01:58:46 FEW HOURS. THE NORMALIZATION OF VIOLENCE

01:58:49 IS A TROUBLING ISSUE. CAROL:

01:58:57 THE ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER OUTLINED THREE PREREQUISITES TO

01:59:00 ACHIEVING PEACE IN THE WAR WITH HAMAS.

01:59:03 THE DESTRUCTION OF THE GROUP, THE DEMILITARIZATION OF GAZA

01:59:06 AND BEING ERRATIC ALLIES.

01:59:12 HAVING SAID THAT, THERE IS A LOT OF PRESSURE ON ISRAEL TO

01:59:13 END THIS. WHAT IS THE LIKELY OUTCOME?

01:59:19 IS THE PRESSURE BUILDING THAT YOU THINK THERE COULD BE SOME

01:59:22 KIND OF TRUCE CREATED SOONER RATHER THAN LATER?

01:59:25 >> THE HEAD OF HAMAS HAS MADE AN ANNOUNCEMENT DURING THIS

01:59:30 TIME IN WHICH HE HAS REFUSED TO SURRENDER AND IS MADE SOME

01:59:34 OUTLANDISH CLAIMS ON LOSSES. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PRIME

01:59:39 MINISTER OF ISRAEL STATEMENT, THE TROUBLING ASPECT IS THE

01:59:41 DE-RADICALIZATION OF GAZA SOCIETY.

01:59:43 THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD TAKE MONTHS IF NOT YEARS.

01:59:47 THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY DOES NOT HAVE A LOT OF

01:59:49 EXPERIENCE WITH THIS. SAUDI ARABIA AND THE EMIRATES

01:59:51 DO THIS FOR THEIR OWN WORLD.

01:59:57 NETANYAHU DID NOT MENTION THE HOSTAGES AND IS, TO SIGNIFICANT

02:00:01 PRESSURE FOR NOT DOING MORE TO BRING BACK THE ROUGHLY 100 PLUS

02:00:04 HOSTAGES WHO REMAIN IN THE HANDS OF HAMAS. MANUS:

02:00:09 WILL WE HEAR A DIFFERENT RHETORIC FROM THE BIDEN

02:00:12 ADMINISTRATION GOING INTO THE NEW YEAR?

02:00:14 >> I DON'T THINK SO. THE WHITE HOUSE WILL CONTINUE

02:00:19 TO EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO DEFEND ITSELF AND TO

02:00:24 PUNISH AND ERADICATE THE HAMAS LEADERSHIP BUT YOU WILL ALSO

02:00:27 SEE CONTINUED PRESSURE BY THE UNITED STATES TO BRING IN MORE

02:00:32 HUMANITARIAN SUPPLIES AND RESPOND THAT THE MORE FUEL THAT

02:00:35 COMES IN AND HAMAS USES THAT FUEL TO RETAIN CONTROL OF

02:00:37 TUNNELS AND THAT EXTENDS THE CONFLICT. I THINK YOU WILL SEE A

02:00:42 CONTINUATION OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S NARRATIVE.

02:00:45 CAROL: IS IT TIME FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO CHANGE THAT

02:00:49 NARRATIVE IF YOU CONSIDER THE GLOBAL PRESSURE?

02:00:53 >> THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT. IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR

02:00:56 ISRAEL WHICH HAS GONE THROUGH THE OCTOBER 7 MASSACRE AND THE

02:01:00 BAD NEWS ON HOSTAGES AND THE LOSSES OF ITS OWN PERSONNEL TO

02:01:03 SAY IT WOULD TOLERATE THE CONTINUED EXISTENCE OF THE

02:01:08 HAMAS TOP THREE MILITARY LEADERS IN THE RADICALIZATION

02:01:10 OF THE SOCIETY ON THE BORDER. WHAT WE SHOULD LOOK FOR IS THE

02:01:16 LIKELIHOOD THAT WILL INCREASE ITS FOCUS ON ERADICATING THE

02:01:20 TOP THREE PERSONNEL IN THE HAMAS MILITARY LEADERSHIP OR

02:01:21 FORCING THEM TO FLEE COUNTRY. CAROL:

02:01:25 WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THIS MORNING. NORM RULE OF CSIS.

02:01:36 I FEEL WE ARE GETTING TO THIS POINT WHERE WE WIDEN OUT AND IT

02:01:39 BECOMES A BIGGER SITUATION AND IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE POSSIBLY

02:01:44 THERE OR IS THERE SOME WAY OF BRINGING IT TO AN END SO WE CAN

02:01:45 MOVE ON? MANUS:

02:01:53 FROM A HUMAN POINT OF VIEW, THE DEATH TOLL IS INCREASING AND

02:01:55 YOU WERE RIGHT TO ASK THE QUESTION, WILL THERE BE A SHIFT

02:01:58 FROM THE WHITE HOUSE?

02:02:05 A 1.5% LURCH IN OIL PRICES IS SIGNIFICANT AND THAT TALKS TO

02:02:11 THE ONGOING RISK FROM HOUTHI REBELS IN THE RED SEA.

02:02:20 THAT CAN BRING FLASHPOINTS BY ITSELF AND THAT'S THE RISK.

02:02:26 CAROL: THAT CAN CHANGE IN A MOMENT.

02:02:29 KATIE: IT'S BEEN A LOT OF WHAT WAKES

02:02:32 UP CRUISE? MAYBE WE'VE REACHED THAT POINT.

02:02:36 IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHETHER THAT CONTINUES INTO

02:02:41 2024. MANUS: THE PRESUMPTION IS THE DEFICITS

02:02:44 WILL APPEAR IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2024.

02:02:51 CAROL: WTI CRUDE FUTURES UP ABOUT 9%

02:02:55 AND WE'VE HAD ABOVE 2% IN THIS EARLY TRADE.

02:02:57 WE WILL KEEP A WATCH ON THIS. WE ARE TALKING RETAIL NEXT.

02:03:15 CAROL:CAROL: WELCOME BACK. THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE

02:03:20 ON THIS TUESDAY. WE ARE WATCHING THE MARKETS.

02:03:28 IT IS QUIET, CERTAINLY ON THE EQUITY FRONT. NO SURPRISE.

02:03:32 A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TRAVELING TODAY.

02:03:35 WE HAD A BIT OF A BREATHER ON FRIDAY.

02:03:38 WHAT ARE REALLY FOCUSING ON IS NOT THE BOND MARKET BUT NEW

02:03:42 YORK CRUDE. WE HAVE BEEN ABOUT 2% IN THE

02:03:45 TRADE HERE EARLY ON. UP $1.40.

02:03:51 THIS IS ON CONCERNS THAT WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE MIDDLE EAST

02:03:57 IS BROADENING OUT, INVOLVING MAYBE INCREASINGLY THE UNITED

02:04:03 STATES. THE U.S.

02:04:05 MILITARY STRIKING THREE INSTALLATIONS IN IRAQ,

02:04:07 TARGETING WHAT IT CALLED A TERRORIST GROUP BACK BY IRAN.

02:04:15 THIS COMES AS TENSIONS RISE IN THE REGION WITH THE

02:04:23 ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR AND SHIPPING ATTACKS IN THE RED SEA.

02:04:30 CRUCIAL TRADE ROUTE.

02:04:39 KATIE: -- ALL THE SNARLS WE HAD DURING

02:04:44 THE PANDEMIC MAY BE WORKING THEMSELVES OUT.

02:04:48 NOW ANOTHER HEADACHE. MANUS:

02:04:50 OVER 100 SHIPS REDIRECTING FROM THE RED SEA. YOU HAVE ONE OF THE

02:04:55 SECOND-BIGGEST CONTAINER COMPANIES IN THE WORLD.

02:04:59 THE AIR RETURNING TO THE RED SEA TO RESUME SHIPPING THROUGH

02:05:01 THE RED SEA. YOU HAVE THIS COALITION OF THE

02:05:05 WILLING IN TERMS OF A PROTECTORATE ACROSS SHIPPING.

02:05:08 THIS IS IMPORTANT FROM A SUPPLY CHAIN OF VIEW BUT ALSO THE

02:05:14 MESSAGING BACK TO THE PROXIES IN TERMS OF THE DEFENSE THAT

02:05:17 THE COALITION WILL BRING TO BEAR.

02:05:20 CAROL: THEY WILL NOT DO IT IF THEY

02:05:23 THINK SOMETHING WILL GO WRONG. IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG, YOU

02:05:25 START TO SEE A FREEZE. MANUS: IT IS INCREMENTAL.

02:05:31 SO FAR, NO MONUMENTAL DEBACLE IN SHIPPING.

02:05:35 IT IS WHETHER SOMETHING OF FIELD OR SIZE REALLY CHANGES.

02:05:38 CAROL: A DIFFERENT KIND OF DEBACLE HAS

02:05:42 TO DO WITH SAMSUNG, THEY OUGHT --.

02:05:48 THEY ARE DELAYING. THE COMPANY PUSHING BACK MASS

02:05:52 PRODUCTION AT THE LAB TO 2025. IT HAD BEEN SCHEDULED TO START

02:05:57 THE SECOND HALF OF 2020. ALSO PROPOSING THAT POSTPONING

02:06:05 PRODUCTION AT THE ARIZONA SITE. EVERYTHING HAS CHIPS.

02:06:09 WE HAVE SEEN A GLOBAL MOVE TO UP PRODUCTION AND BRING IT BACK

02:06:15 HOME. KATIE: YOU THINK ABOUT SUPPLY CHAINS.

02:06:18 THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO AVOID A REPEAT OF WHAT

02:06:21 HAPPENED IN 2021 WHEN YOU HAD THAT SHORTAGE WANTING TO BRING

02:06:26 CHIPMAKERS TO AMERICAN SOIL. WE WILL SEE IF IT GETS DELAYED

02:06:27 AGAIN. MANUS:

02:06:34 THE SHIPS ACT PROMISED 100 BILLION CONDUCTORS IN SUPPORT

02:06:35 OF THE SEMI CONDUCTOR INDUSTRY. I WAS ON A CALL WITH HENRI.

02:06:43 HE SAID EVERY CEO HE SPEAKS TO IN EUROPE IS OBSESSED BY THE

02:06:48 INFLATION REDUCTION ACT. WHEN YOU COME TO LIVE HERE, IT

02:06:54 IS AS IF THESE POLICIES ARE VERY POLITICIZED -- I

02:06:58 UNDERSTAND THAT -- AND VERY POLITICAL, RATHER THAN SEEING

02:07:03 THEM AS THE METAMORPHOSIS OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE TECHNOLOGY

02:07:08 OF EUROPE. KATIE: GOT TO START ASKING AMERICAN

02:07:12 CEOS, ARGUE OBSESSED WITH THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT? CAROL:

02:07:17 ANOTHER EARNINGS CALL. BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT LIQUIDITY.

02:07:21 THAT IS ANOTHER ROUND THAT IS COMING TO THE MARKET AS A

02:07:22 RESULT OF THAT MEASURE. SHARES OF MANCHESTER UNITED

02:07:28 GETTING A BOOST AFTER JIM RATCLIFF AGREED TO BUY A 25%

02:07:31 STAKE IN THE CLUB.

02:07:37 THE DEAL VALUES OF THE CLUB AT ABOUT $5.4 BILLION.

02:07:42 THE PURCHASE MARKS THE END OF A DRAWN OUT SALE PROCESS.

02:07:46 IT IS TORTURE, TO SAY THE LEAST. MANUS: TODAY BY AMERICAN?

02:07:51 KATIE: THEY LOVE ROCKETS, TOO. MANUS:

02:07:56 SOCIETIES LOVE BUYING FOOTBALL PLAYERS, SPORTS TEAMS. HERE WE

02:08:03 ARE. THE ATTORNEYS ON STRIKE.

02:08:06 IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE BACK TO $6 BILLION.

02:08:10 RATCLIFF HAS PAID UP TO A $33 BILLION. CAROL: INTERESTING.

02:08:15 YOU SEE THE MIDDLE EAST WANTING TO GET INVOLVED IN SPORTS.

02:08:19 MANUS: THERE IS THE ZEITGEIST AND ALSO

02:08:23 A BRITISH FIELD TO THIS. IT IS A BRITISH BILLIONAIRE

02:08:29 PAYING $33 80 SHARE, PUTTING MONEY INTO THE CLUB.

02:08:35 HE JUST FINISHED WATCHING NETFLIX. CAROL:

02:08:39 BECAUSE MY WHOLE REFERENCE POINT.

02:08:45 DAVID BECKMAN, HIS CLOSETS ARE IMMACULATE. KATIE:

02:08:49 TIM AND VICTORIA. WHAT A POWER COUPLE. I DO THAT.

02:08:55 I WAS BORN AND GREW UP IN THE 1990'S, BUT TO SEE IT WAS A

02:08:56 NICE REMINDER. MANUS: IT IS A FACT THAT YOU SEE HIM

02:08:59 AS A BEEKEEPER. CAROL: VERY SUCCESSFUL INDIVIDUAL IN

02:09:07 TERMS OF HOW HE PLAYED AND WHAT HE DID WITH IT AFTERWARD. MANUS:

02:09:11 TO LEAVE IN THE BRAND AND THE MARKET.

02:09:18 FOUNDER AND CEO OF COFFIN ADVISORS.

02:09:20 BELIEVE IN THE POWER OF IMMACULATE DISINFLATION.

02:09:24 160 BASIS POINTS OF CUTS. HOW BULLISH ARE YOU THIS

02:09:25 MORNING?

02:09:36 >> I -- IN TERMS OF THE OUTLOOK FOR NEXT YEAR, I AM QUITE

02:09:40 CONSTRUCTIVE ON RISK ASSETS SUCH AS EQUITIES.

02:09:42 THERE ARE A LOT OF REASONS FOR THAT. YOU REFERENCED SIX CUTS.

02:09:48 I THINK IT IS ALMOST SEVEN BETWEEN JANUARY 2025 AND TODAY.

02:09:52 THERE IS A BIT OF A DISJUNCTION GOING ON.

02:09:59 IF SEVEN CUTS ARE INSTANTLY COMING, I WILL NOT BE SO

02:10:00 BULLISH ON EQUITIES. I LOVE THE FACT THAT THE APEX

02:10:09 OF THIS VIOLENT HIKING CYCLE. IF POWELL IS REALLY GOING TO

02:10:13 CUT SIX OR SEVEN TIMES OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, IT IS PROBABLY

02:10:18 BECAUSE THERE IS SOMETHING BEYOND INFLATION GOING ON.

02:10:23 FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, THAT IS NOT DEAD LOVE COMING BACK.

02:10:31 BUT I AM CONSTRUCTIVE ON THE ECONOMY.

02:10:35 I AM CONSTRUCTIVE ON THE EARNINGS PROFILE BROADLY

02:10:38 SPEAKING NEXT YEAR. IT WILL NOT BE THAT, OH MY GOD,

02:10:43 WE DO NOT HAVE A RECESSION UPSIDE CONDITION THAT WILL

02:10:48 DEFINE 2020 THREE. THAT UPSIDE SURPRISE FACTOR IS

02:10:52 GONE, BUT I THINK IT IS HELD TOGETHER WELL BY A DECENT

02:10:55 PICTURE. I THINK THE BIG TECH NAMES WILL

02:11:00 CONTINUE TO BE THE REAL DRIVER OF OVERALL EARNINGS AND AN

02:11:02 OVERALL REASON TO BE HEAVILY A IN THE STOCK MARKET. KATIE:

02:11:07 YOU MENTIONED THAT IF THE FED IS CUTTING SIX OR SEVEN TIMES,

02:11:10 IT IS NOT NECESSARILY THE FED PUT.

02:11:19 INTERESTING NOTE FROM CITI LAST WEEK SAYING THAT PULLBACKS ARE

02:11:21 AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUY MORE, SAYING THAT BY THE DIP IS

02:11:24 COMING BACK. IS THAT A PROPER MINDSET FOR

02:11:26 2024? MICHAEL:

02:11:32 YOU CUT OUT FOR A SECOND. I THINK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:11:33 BUYING THE EQUITY DIP? KATIE: YES. MICHAEL:

02:11:39 WHEN YOU STEP BACK AND YOU STEP BACK AND THINK ABOUT WHAT

02:11:46 HAPPENED IN 2022 AND 2023, YOU HAD A BIG SURPRISE TO THE

02:11:47 DOWNSIDE IN 2022.

02:11:56 YOU HAVE A SIMILAR THING IN REVERSE THIS YEAR.

02:12:00 YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND SO MUCH ABOUT THE RALLY THIS YEAR WAS

02:12:07 INSTIGATED NOT BY DRAMATICALLY ACCELERATING FUNDAMENTALS SO

02:12:12 MUCH AS IT WAS, WOW, THERE IS NOT A RECESSION.

02:12:17 YOU TEND TO THINK OF POSITIONING MISMATCH AS THINGS

02:12:22 OVER A COUPLE OF DAYS, MAYBE A MONTH. THIS WAS A WHOLE YEAR.

02:12:30 THE LOT OF THE BIG ALLOCATORS WERE PLAYING CATCH-UP IN THE

02:12:33 SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR BECAUSE THEY WERE PROBABLY OVERWEIGHT

02:12:35 IN BONDS AND UNDERWEIGHT IN EQUITIES.

02:12:41 AS WE GET TO 2024, I THINK THAT POSITIONING MISMATCH IS GOING

02:12:44 TO BE LARGELY BEHIND US. IT WILL BE LESS O
