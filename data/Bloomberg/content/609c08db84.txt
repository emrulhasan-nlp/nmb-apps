On Oct. 15, Ecuador’s presidential runoff will pit Daniel Noboa , the 35-year-old heir to a banana empire, against Luisa Gonzalez, 45, a political protege of ex-President Rafael Correa . It’s deja vu, politics-style: In the 2006 presidential runoff, Alvaro, Daniel’s father, lost to Correa by a two-digit margin.

Now, in a stunning surprise, Daniel can avenge his wealthy father — a six-time presidential contender — in what’s become the country’s most dramatic election in decades. “All the people who want to see change have prevailed,” Noboa said on Sunday night.
