The US is set to hold rare nuclear arms control talks with China amid growing concerns over Beijing’s accelerated push to build up its arsenal of atomic weapons, according to an administration official.

The objective of the low-level discussions, scheduled to begin next week, is not to reduce the size of China’s arsenal. Instead, their purpose is to give the Biden administration a better understanding of China’s plans weeks after the Pentagon issued a report saying that the country was manufacturing nuclear weapons faster than expected.
