00:15 >> WE'RE LOOKING AT THE DID THE, THE DATA LOOKS STRONG.

00:18 >> THE DATA LOOKS TO THE UPSIDE. >> EVEN IF THE ECONOMY

00:22 CONTINUES TO DO WELL, IT IS THE DECELERATION.

00:26 >> IT IS NOT EASY TO GET INFLATION DOWN THAT QUICKLY.

00:28 IT IS GOING TO TAKE MORE TIME.

00:32 >> AS WE GET INTO THIS YEAR, WE ARE GOING TO SEE WHAT KIND OF

00:33 ECONOMY WE HAVE.

00:39 >> THIS IS "BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE" WITH

00:45 WITH SEVERAL VOIDS, JONATHAN FERRO, AND AND REORDER.

00:47 JONATHAN: GOOD MORNING, WITH LISA

00:51 ABRAMOWICZ AND ANNMARIE HORDERN, I'M JONATHAN FERRO.

00:53 THREE CONSECUTIVE ALL-TIME HIGHS ON THIS AND BE.

00:58 TRUMP ON THE CUSP OF CLINCHING THE GOP DENOMINATION -- GOP

01:01 NOMINATION. FOR NIKKI HALEY, 43.2.

01:06 FOR TRUMP, 54.5. LISA: THIS IS COMPLETELY EXPECTED.

01:12 EVERYONE EXPECTED TRUMP TO PROBABLY WIN.

01:16 THE QUESTION NOW IS DOES NIKKI HALEY DROPOUTS GIVEN SHE HAD A

01:19 PRETTY VICTORIOUS LOSING SPEECH WELL REHEARSED TRUMP'S ANGRY

01:22 WINNING SPEECH.

01:28 WHAT IS NEXT IF SHE HAS NO PATH TO BE THE NOMINEE? ANNMARIE:

01:32 SHE SAID NEW HAMPSHIRE IS THE FIRST IN THE NATION, NOT THE

01:36 LAST. SHE HAS SOME MONEY. IF YOU LOOK AT THE SOUTH:

01:42 A POLLS -- SOUTH CAROLINA POLLS, IT LOOKS LIKE SHE MIGHT

01:43 BE IMMERSED IN HER HOME STATE. BUT SHE MIGHT WANT TO HANG

01:47 AROUND IF FOR SOME REASON TRUMP CANNOT RUN IN NOVEMBER. LISA:

01:53 THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING ASPECTS, HOPE AND

01:56 DREAM IS SOMETHING OTHER THAN AN MATCHUP BETWEEN TRUMP AND

02:01 BIDEN. WITH MORE THAN THREE QUARTERS

02:04 OF THE VOTE IN, MORE THAN TWO IN FIVE VOTERS VOTED FOR

02:08 SOMEBODY BESIDES BIDEN AND TRUMP. ANNMARIE:

02:10 THEY DON'T WANT THAT MATCHUP. JOE BIDEN IS GOING TO SAY WHAT

02:14 HIS FATHER ALWAYS TOLD HIM, DON'T COMPARE YOURSELF TO THE

02:15 ALMIGHTY. COMPARE ME TO THE ALTERNATIVE.

02:21 THAT IS THE HOPE, PEOPLE WILL GET INTO THAT BOOTH AND HOLD

02:23 THEIR NOSE AND VOTE FOR JOE BIDEN. JONATHAN:

02:25 IS THAT THE PIT FROM JOE BIDEN? -- THE PITCH FROM JOE BIDEN?

02:31 ANNMARIE: NOT PUBLICLY. JONATHAN:

02:35 RIGHT NOW, MARKETS DON'T CARE. EQUITY FUTURES ARE POSITIVE ON

02:38 S&P 500. CHECK OUT SHARES ON NETFLIX,

02:42 CHOOSING THE MOVE HIGHER AFTER HOURS.

02:46 THE BEST QUARTER OF SUB GROWTH SINCE THE PANDEMIC, THE BEACH

02:48 PROJECTIONS ON EVERY REGION. THE PASSWORD CLAMPDOWN IS

02:53 PAYING OFF COME UP BY 9.6%. LISA:

02:56 PEOPLE ARE WONDERING IF THERE IS ANYTHING UNDER THIS RALLY WE

03:00 ARE SEEING IN THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN.

03:02 HERE IS THE THING, THE PROFITS ARE THERE.

03:04 THEY ARE ABLE TO DELIVER.

03:11 NETFLIX, WHETHER IT IS THEY HAVE CRITICAL MASS AND PEOPLE

03:13 ARE TIED TO THEIR PHONES, THE FACT THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO ADD

03:15 THE GREATEST NUMBER OF SUBSCRIBERS WHEN ALL OF US WERE

03:19 LOOKING FOR ANY SCREEN TO PUT OUR KIDS ONTO. ANNMARIE:

03:21 YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK IS UNDER IT? DAVID BECKHAM.

03:25 THAT DOCUMENTARY CAME OUT. EVEN MY PARENTS WATCHED IT AND

03:28 MY MOM SAID I AM GOING TO GET IN NETFLIX ACCOUNT.

03:34 SHE IS NOT TRYING PASSWORD SHARING.

03:38 THAT DOCUMENTARY IS FANTASTIC. JONATHAN:

03:43 THAT IS UP 9% THIS MORNING ACCORDING TO DAVID BECKHAM.

03:46 EQUITY FUTURES LOOK LIKE THIS, POSITIVE BY 21 POINTS ON THE

03:51 S&P. YIELDS COMING IN THREE BASIS

03:54 POINTS.

04:00 ON A 10 YEAR IN AMERICA, FOR 10 -- YIELDS ARE UP IN JAPAN, RATE

04:02 HIKES ALL OVER AGAIN. LISA: PEOPLE ARE EXPECTING THEM TO

04:06 MAKE THAT MOVE AND WE HEARD THAT WITH YOU THINK OF JAPAN

04:11 INDICATING THEY ARE PREPARED TO SHIFT SOME OF THEIR STRATEGY.

04:14 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN EXPECTING THIS IT LONG TIME.

04:17 THE COMMON FEELING IS APRIL, IF THEY ABANDON NEGATIVE RATE

04:21 POLICY. MAYBE YOU WILL GET SOME ACTION.

04:24 JONATHAN: COMING UP IN THIS PROGRAM,

04:31 CHRIS MARANGI, KAILEY LEINZ ON TRUMP'S VICTORY, AND MANDEEP

04:34 SINGH ON TECH EARNINGS. WE BEGIN WITH OUR TOP STORY,

04:38 THE STOCK MARKET RALLY CONTINUES WITH TEKTRONIX

04:40 UNDERWAY. NETFLIX POSTING ITS BIGGEST

04:43 SUBSCRIBER GAMES THAT THE PANDEMIC.

04:47 CHRIS MARANGI SAYING THE PRESSURE IS RIGHT FOR MEDIA TO

04:48 MERGE AND COMPETE.

04:54 THEY MARCHED FROM ANALOG TO DIGITAL CONTINUES, THE MEDIA

04:56 INFRASTRUCTURE WILL NEVER BE AS FAVORABLE IN -- AS IN DECADES

05:00 PAST. CHRIS MERENGUE JOINS US NOW. IS IT GOING TO BE BAD FOR

05:04 INDUSTRY AND CONSUMERS? CHRIS: I DON'T KNOW HOW IT SHAKES OFF

05:09 ABOUT CONSUMERS, WE WILL NEED CONSOLIDATION.

05:11 NETFLIX SHOWS THAT SCALES MATTERS.

05:16 NETFLIX IS NOW ANTI-INCUMBENT, CLEARLY THE GLOBAL LEADER IN

05:19 SCREAMING -- IN STREAMING. THERE ABLE TO ADD SUBSCRIBERS.

05:24 THE REST OF THE INDUSTRY ARE GOING TO NEED TO FOLLOW. LISA:

05:27 DOES THIS MEAN YOU EXPECT NETFLIX TO ACQUIRE SOMEONE?

05:31 CHRIS: THEY DEMANDED TO SIT WITH THIS

05:34 SAID YESTERDAY THEY DON'T INTEND TO ACQUIRE ANY LINEAR

05:36 PROGRAMMING COMPANIES. THEY'RE GOING TO ADD CONTENT.

05:42 IT IS THE LETTER COMPANIES THAT NEED TO RATIONALIZE THE MESS OF

05:45 STREAMING SERVICES WE HAVE. THAT CAN HAPPEN THROUGH

05:49 CONSOLIDATION, ALSO THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS. LISA:

05:51 LET'S BREAK THIS DOWN. WHERE DO YOU LEAN IN AND WHERE

05:54 DEALING OUT? HOW DO YOU PLAY THIS IF

05:58 DISRUPTION COULD BE PROFITABLE? CHRIS:

06:05 WE LIKE THE IP OWNERS, THOSE WHO OWN THE CONTENT THEMSELVES.

06:07 THOSE ARE HARD TO FIND. ONE PLACE WE FOUND THAT ARE IN

06:13 SPORTS, DEMONSTRATED BY THE W W E DEAL.

06:16 THIS IS CONTENT PEOPLE WANT TO WATCH THAT ADVERTISERS WILL PAY

06:17 FOR. SECOND, WE ARE LOOKING FOR UNDERVALUED MEDIA COMPANIES.

06:23 WARNER BROS. DISCOVERY OR EVEN PARAMOUNT.

06:30 NETFLIX TODAY HAS THE ENTIRE ENTERPRISE VALUE OF PARAMOUNT

06:31 WHICH IS $22 BILLION. JONATHAN: CAN WE GET TO SPORTS?

06:38 IT IS TOUGH FOR ME TO COME BASE WHEN THEY HAVE TO RELEASE THE

06:39 ASSET AND THEY DON'T OWN IT. ESPN IS A STRUGGLE, DISNEY

06:43 DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT. WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE IN

06:46 YEARS TO COME? THEY PAPER THESE ASSETS, THE

06:50 NOTE ON THEM. DO WE GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE

06:54 REACH THE LIMIT OF THE PRICE OF THAT ASSET? CHRIS:

07:00 NETFLIX PAYING $5 BILLION OVER FIVE YEARS FOR WWE IS AN

07:05 INDICATION THAT SPORTS RIGHTS ARE GOING TO GO UP.

07:08 YOU HAVE TECH COMPANIES THAT ARE GOING TO BE PLAYERS.

07:14 MLB HAS A VISION OF OWNING SOME OF THE STREAMING SERVICES

07:17 THEMSELVES, PERHAPS THE NFL OR SOMEBODY ELSE GETS INVOLVED IN

07:19 ESPN. I WOULD EXPECT THE BIG TECH

07:23 DOLLARS TO START FLOWING. LISA:

07:29 THERE IS NO WAY THE W WB IS A

07:35 SPORT -- AND THE WWE IS A SPORT. 20 HAVE A PREDETERMINED

07:40 OUTCOME, THAT IS INDEPENDENT. HOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHETHER

07:43 YOU ARE INVESTING IN THE

07:49 COMPANY FOR QUALITY, CONTENT, EVERYBODY WAS WORRIED ABOUT TOO

07:52 MUCH CONTENT SPENDING, VERSUS THE WINNER TAKE ALL THIS IS?

07:58 CHRIS: IT ALL COMES DOWN TO PRICE AND

07:59 WHAT YOU PAY, NETFLIX IS A PHENOMENAL COMPANY.

08:02 THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TWO MINUTES GROWTH.

08:05 -- HAVE TWO MINUTES GROWTH. -- TREMENDOUS GROWTH.

08:11 FOR SOMEONE LIKE US, THAT IS WHAT YOU DO. WARNER BROS.

08:14 AND PARAMOUNT HAVE THEIR CHALLENGES.

08:19 THERE DRINK FIVE OR SIX TIMES, THE MESH EDITOR -- ANNMARIE:

08:24 WILL WE SEE MORE OF SPORTS TEAMS OR VENUES TAKE ON THE

08:29 DISTRIBUTION LIKE MSG? AND THEN IT GOES TO THE FACT

08:33 THAT THIS WITH STEAM NEEDS TO BE POPULAR FOR THAT TO WORK.

08:36 CHRIS: YOU ARE SEEING SIGNS OF THAT IN

08:40 BASEBALL AND BASKETBALL, DIAMOND SPORTS.

08:45 AMAZON IS INVESTING AND RECAPITALIZING.

08:50 THE TEAMS ARE ASSERTIVELY INTERESTED IN VIEWERSHIP AND

08:52 GATHERING EYEBALLS AND MAKING MONEY. PERHAPS THAT MEANS TAKING

08:57 OWNERSHIP STAKE IN THE MEDIA RATES. ANNMARIE:

09:00 COULD NETFLIX BE ONE OF THOSE DESTINATIONS?

09:02 CHRIS: NETFLIX TALKED ABOUT BEING

09:05 HONEST WITH ADJACENT PROPERTIES, NOT SPORTS

09:07 PROPERTIES. I THINK THE PUT THAT IN THERE

09:11 TO NOTE THEY ARE NOT GOOD TO BE A BIDDER ON THE NEXT BIG

09:12 PROPERTY WHICH IS THE NBA. JONATHAN:

09:18 ARE WE BUILDING A MODEL THAT CONSUMERS DISLIKE AND COMPANY

09:19 STRUGGLE TO MAKE MONEY WITH? CHRIS:

09:23 OUR CONSUMERS HAPPY TODAY? THERE IS MORE CONTENT THAN EVER

09:25 BEFORE. JONATHAN: I WILL SPEAK FOR MYSELF, I AM

09:32 DISSATISFIED I HAVE EIGHT DIFFERENT APPS. CHRIS:

09:36 THE INDUSTRY IS AWARE OF THAT AND IT THINK THERE ARE WAYS TO

09:40 FIX IT INCLUDING CONSOLIDATING STREAMING SERVICES AND BUNDLING

09:42 STREAMING SERVICES. WE HAVE A RE-AGGREGATION LED BY

09:46 KIM COMPANIES WERE PART OF YOUR SERVICE YOU GET A BOX THAT PUTS

09:47 ALL THE STUFF TOGETHER. JONATHAN: BACK TO THE FUTURE.

09:52 LISA: WHAT IS THE NEW MODEL? THE OLD MODEL.

09:57 THAT IS WHAT EVERYONE HAS BEEN SAYING. JONATHAN:

10:00 ANY IDEA OF WHAT THE PRICE POINT ON THAT LOOKS LIKE? CHRIS:

10:05 PROBABLY CHEAPER THAN THE BIG BUNDLE BUT NOT AS CHEAP AS YOU

10:07 THINK IT WOULD BE. JONATHAN: THE BROADBAND PROVIDERS ARE TO

10:10 BE THE WINNERS? CHRIS: YOU NEED BROADBAND TO DO ANY OF

10:13 THIS. IN MOST OF THE COUNTRY THAT WAS

10:16 THE CABLE COMPANY. OVER THE LAST 18 MONTHS OR SO

10:20 YOU HAVE SEEN WIRELESS TAKE SHARE.

10:22 COMCAST REPORTS TOMORROW, WE WILL SEE HOW MANY SUBSCRIBERS

10:25 THEY LOSE. JONATHAN: NETFLIX THIS MORNING UP BIG

10:28 TIME IN THE PREMARKET. CHRIS WILL BE STICKING WITH

10:30 THIS. THERE EQUITY ON THE S&P, POSITIVE.

10:36 HERE IS YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF.

10:41 >> FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HAS TAKEN A DECISIVE WIN

10:45 IN THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY ALTAR GUARANTEE A REMATCH WITH

10:49 PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. TRUMPED TOOK 55% OF GOP PRIMARY

10:53 VOTES WITH 75% OF BALLOTS COUNTED.

10:57 COMFORTABLY BEATING HIS ONLY REMAINING CHALLENGER, NIKKI

11:01 HALEY. THE FORMER YUAN INVESTOR HAS

11:04 VOWED TO STAY IN THE RACE AND NOW LOOKS TO HER HOME STATE OF

11:11 SOUTH CAROLINA.

11:12 ASML SAW ORDERS MORE THAN TRIPLE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER.

11:16 THE DEMAND FOR PRODUCTS FOR THE MOST VIABLE TECH COMPANY

11:21 INCREASED. THE CEO EMPHASIZING THE

11:24 COMPANY'S ROLE IN THE AI FRENZY. >> ONE THING IS A SHORT, IT IS

11:29 GOING TO NEED MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF DATA STORAGE.

11:37 WITHOUT OUR TECHNOLOGY, THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

11:41 IT IS VERY CLEAR IT IS GOING TO BE A BIG DRIVER FOR OUR

11:43 BUSINESS AND THE BUSINESS OF OUR CUSTOMERS.

11:53 >> PRIVATE-SECTOR ACTIVITY CONTRACTED FOR AND IS MONTH

11:55 WITH GERMANY AND FRANCE IN PARTICULAR SEEING THE RESULTS.

12:01 THE DATA COMES A WEEK BEFORE THE EURO AREA IS SET TO REPORT

12:03 GDP WHICH WILL LIKELY SHOW RECESSION. U.K.

12:07 PMI DATA SHOWS INFLATION WORRIES HAVE RETURNED THANKS TO

12:09 THE CONFLICT IN THE RED SEA. PRIVATE-SECTOR FIRMS REPORTED

12:15 THE SHARPEST JOB IN COSTS IN FIVE MONTHS.

12:17 THAT IS YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF. JONATHAN:

12:21 COMING UP NEXT, TRUMP CRUISING TOWARDS A REMATCH WITH

12:27 PRESIDENT BIDEN.

12:29 >> THIS IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL THEIR SPEECH BUT LET'S NOT HAVE

12:30 SOMEONE TAKE A VICTORY WHEN SHE HAD A BAD NIGHT.

12:33 >> THIS RACE IS FAR FROM OVER. THERE ARE DOZENS OF STATES LEFT

12:35 TO GO. JONATHAN: THAT IS COMING UP NEXT ON THE

12:38 PROGRAM. LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY, GOOD

12:41 MORNING.

13:29 JONATHAN: HERE IS THE PRESS SECTION ON

13:34 THE S&P, HIGHER BY .5% ON A FOUR DAY WINNING STREAK, THE

13:35 LOWEST WINNING STREAK OF THE YEAR SOFI.

13:39 YIELDS LOWER BY TWO BASIS POINTS.

13:44 UNDER SURVEILLANCE, TRUMP CRUISING TOWARDS A REMATCH WITH

13:51 PRESIDENT BIDEN.

13:52 MR. TRUMP: WE WON NEW HAMPSHIRE THREE

13:54 TIMES NOW. LET'S NOT HAVE SOMEBODY TAKE A

13:57 VICTORY WHEN SHE HAD A VERY BAD NIGHT.

14:04 >> NEW HAMPSHIRE IS THE FIRST IN THE NATION, NOT THE LAST IN

14:05 THE NATION. THIS RACE IS FAR FROM OVER,

14:09 THERE ARE DOZENS OF STATES LEFT TO GO. JONATHAN:

14:13 THE FORMER PRESIDENT DEFEATING NIKKI HALEY IN THE PRIMARY.

14:17 TRUMP CLAIMING VICTORY BY 11 POINTS WITH OVER 90% OF BALLOTS

14:22 COUNTED.

14:23 THE HALEY TRAILING OVER 30 POINTS IN POLLS IN HER HOME

14:26 STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA NEXT MONTH. ANNMARIE:

14:29 IT IS PRETTY ROUGH WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS, TRUMP IS

14:34 AVERAGING 62.2%. NIKKI HALEY IS AVERAGING 25%

14:38 HEADING INTO WHAT SHE SAID WAS HER SWEET HOME STATE OF SOUTH

14:43 CAROLINA. YOU LOOK AT THE ENDORSEMENTS,

14:46 WHETHER IT IS THE GOVERNOR, LAWMAKERS OR STATEWIDE

14:48 OFFICIALS, DONALD TRUMP HAS 13 AND HIS CAP COME SHE HAS ONE.

14:53 JONATHAN: KAILEY LEINZ JOINS US NOW.

14:57 WHAT IS THE ARGUMENT FOR NIKKI HALEY TO STAY IN THE RACE?

15:04 KAILEY: SOUTH CAROLINA IS HER HOME

15:07 STATE WHICH SHE INTENDS TO PUT UP A GOOD FIGHT THERE.

15:12 LOOKING BEYOND THAT SOUTH CAROLINA PRIMARY, WE SHOULD ALL

15:16 KEEP IN MIND 11 OF THOSE 16 STATES AND TERRITORIES THAT

15:20 FOOT ON THAT DAY HAVE OPEN OR SEMI-OPEN PRIMARIES, THE

15:23 THINKING BEING SHE COULD ATTRACT INDEPENDENT OR FORMER

15:26 DEMOCRATIC VOTES. THE THING IS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE

15:30 LAST NIGHT WHERE THE BASE OF VOTERS IS MORE INDEPENDENT, 40%

15:34 OF THOSE REGISTERED WERE UNDECLARED VOTERS, SHE COULD

15:37 NOT GET IT DONE. HOW COULD SHE GET IT DONE IN

15:41 THESE OTHER STATES IN LIGHT OF WHAT COULD BE PRESSURE TO DROP

15:47 OUT OF THIS RACE NOT JUST FROM THE MAG BASEA.

15:55 EVEN ESTABLISHMENT REPUBLICANS ARE LINING UP TO SAY WE SHOULD

15:57 FOLLOW LEND BEHIND THE PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE, DONALD

16:00 TRUMP. BIG LEADERS IN THE SENATE, FOR

16:03 EXAMPLE, AND THE OTHER ENDORSEMENTS THAT TRUMP HAS

16:06 GOTTEN FROM OTHERS IN THIS RACE LIKE SENATOR TIM SCOTT.

16:10 A LOT OF IS GOOD AND ON WHETHER OR NOT BIG-MONEY DONORS

16:12 CONTINUE TO BACK HER. A BIG FUNDRAISER IS GOING TO BE

16:19 HAD FOR NIKKI HALEY HELD BY THE LIKES OF STANLEY DRUCKENMILLER.

16:24 A LOT OF THESE WALL STREET DONORS HAS TO BEEN BACKING HER.

16:28 THE QUESTION IS WILL THEY CONTINUE TO THROW GOOD MONEY

16:30 AFTER POTENTIALLY BAD IF SHE CONTINUES TO LANGUISH BEHIND

16:32 TRUMP? ANNMARIE: WE WILL HAVE TO SEE IF THE

16:35 DONOR CLASS CONTINUES TO SURE HER UP.

16:40 AS WE LOOK TO THIS GENERAL ELECTION, THE ONE THAT NO

16:42 AMERICAN REALLY WANTS ACCORDING TO THE POLLS, THE BIDEN

16:47 CAMPAIGN ISSUED A STATEMENT THAT SEEMINGLY FELT LIKE THEY

16:50 WERE EAGER FOR IT TO BE TRUMP. KAILEY:

16:54 THAT IS WHAT WE THOUGHT ALL ALONG. OF ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT

17:00 CANDIDATES, NOW THERE ARE ONLY TWO LEFT, TRUMP WAS THE

17:01 PREFERRED OUTCOME FOR THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN.

17:04 BIDEN HAS BEATEN BEFORE. HE DID SO IN 2020 AND THE

17:08 CAMPAIGN BELIEVES HE HAS THE ABILITY TO DO IT AGAIN.

17:12 BIDEN PUT OUT A STATEMENT SAYING IT IS CLEAR TRUMP IS

17:13 GOING TO BE THE NOMINEE. HE SAID HIS MESSAGE IS THAT THE

17:16 STAKES CANNOT BE HIGHER. OUR DEMOCRACY AND PERSONAL

17:21 FREEDOMS ARE AT STAKE AND THAT IS HOW HE IS TRYING TO

17:24 CHARACTERIZE THIS RACE, SOMETHING FUNDAMENTALLY ABOUT

17:26 THE FUTURE OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY AND THE THREAT HE

17:28 SAYS DONALD TRUMP WAS IS TO IT.

17:35 IN THE STATES THAT COULD DECIDE THIS ELECTION, WHEN LOOKING AT

17:37 THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IS THE SWING STATES THAT ARE GOING TO

17:41 MATTER AND MOST IF NOT ALL OF THOSE, TRUMP IS BEATING BIDEN

17:44 IN THEM. IT IS A LONG WAY TO GO, THIS

17:47 WOULD BE ONE OF THE LONGEST GENERAL ELECTIONS IN HISTORY IF

17:48 IT DOES BEGIN NOW. DEVOTE IS MORE THAN NINE MONTHS

17:55 AWAY -- THE VOTE IS MORE THAN NINE MONTHS AWAY BUT BIDEN IS

17:56 HOPING IT IS GOING TO BE REMATCH WITH TRUMP. LISA:

18:01 THERE IS A LOT GOING ON IN WASHINGTON, D.C..

18:05 THERE IS A QUESTION OF IF WE ARE GOING TO GET BUDGETS

18:08 PASSED, FUNDING TO SOME OF OUR ALLIES. I AM CURIOUS WHAT THE

18:12 INCREASING ACRIMONY WITH RESPECT TO THIS RACE BUT ALSO

18:17 IN THIS HOUSE AT THE SENATE -- AND THE SENATE, HOW DONALD

18:21 TRUMP COMING THE LEADER NOW PLAYS INTO THAT. KAILEY:

18:26 HE ALREADY HAS BEEN THE DE FACTO LEADER OF THE REPUBLICAN

18:28 PARTY AS HE HAS REMAINED NOT JUST A FORMER PRESIDENT BUT THE

18:32 LEADER IN THE -- AND THE PRESUMPTIVE FRONT-RUNNER.

18:38 THE ISSUE IN CONGRESS THAT TRANSLATES TO ABOUT THIS IS THE

18:39 ISSUE OF BORDER SECURITY. IN ADDITION TO THE ECONOMY

18:46 BEING CAP FOR VOTERS, THE BORDER WAS TOP OF MIGHT AS WELL.

18:51 WHITE HOUSE AND SENATE NEGOTIATORS ARE WORKING ON A

18:54 PACKAGE TO TRY TO TIE UKRAINE FILING TO THE BORDER SECURITY

18:59 DEAL. QUESTION IS WHAT THE FATE OF

19:02 THAT IS MEANT TO BE, WHETHER OR NOT LAWMAKERS LIKE MIKE JOHNSON

19:04 WHO TALKS TO TRUMP ARE GOING TO PASS A BILL THAT COULD

19:09 POTENTIALLY BE A POLITICAL WIN FOR BIDEN, NORTH HE HAS A

19:10 PROBLEM AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER. HE DOES NOT POLL WELL ON THAT

19:13 ISSUE. IF WE SEE LEGISLATION TRYING TO

19:19 ADDRESS THAT ISSUE, IT COULD PLAY IN HIS FAVOR.

19:27 AS THIS ELECTION DRAWS CLOSER, IT COULD BE DIFFICULT FOR

19:28 REPUBLICANS TO BEHEADING THE WHITE HOUSE THOSE POLITICAL

19:32 WINS. HE POSTED ON TRUE SOCIALIST

19:34 WEEK THAT HOUSE REPUBLICANS SHOULD ONLY ACCEPT A PERFECT

19:35 BORDER DEAL. WE WILL SEE IF HE CONTINUES TO

19:40 PUT THE PRESSURE ON TO SEE IF THE ULTIMATE GET THIS DONE.

19:44 -- IF YOU ULTIMATELY GET THIS DONE. JONATHAN:

19:49 STILL WITH US AT THE TABLE, CHRIS MERENGUE.

19:52 WHAT DO YOU DO WITH POLITICAL RISK IN 2024? CHRIS:

19:56 THE QUESTION IS WHEN DOES WALL STREET CARE?

20:03 IN 2020, WALL STREET DID NOT CARE UNTIL ELECTION NIGHT.

20:09 THERE IS THE CONDUCT OF THE ELECTION, ARE WE GOING TO HAVE

20:12 A CONSISTENT SPEECH THE DAY AFTER -- A CONCESSION SPEECH

20:15 THE DAY AFTER, AND WHAT IS THE POLICY RISK.

20:18 IS POLICY GOING TO CHANGE? IF YOU ARE AN INVESTMENT BANKER

20:23 SITTING IN THE BOARD ROOM, YOU ARE WONDERING IF I WANT TO DO A

20:27 DEAL NOW -- A DEAL, DO I DO IT NOW OR WAIT FOR A MORE FRIENDLY

20:29 TRUMP ADMINISTRATION? FEES ARE THINKS WE ARE THINKING

20:31 ABOUT. WALL STREET HAS ENOUGH ON ITS

20:33 PLATE. JONATHAN: LET'S GO THROUGH SOME SCENARIO

20:37 ANALYSIS. THAT NIGHT AT 2016, I WAS ON

20:41 AIR AND HE STARTED TO SEE FUTURES BOUNCE.

20:46 FUTURE CERTITUDE BOUTS ON THE SPEECH WHAT HE STARTED TO TALK

20:48 ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING. WE STARTED TO FOCUS ON THE

20:56 POLICY AND NOT THE VOLATILITY LIMIT -- THE VOLATILITY THAT

20:57 COMES WITH A MAN. IS IT DIFFERENT THIS TIME

20:59 AROUND? CHRIS: WE HAVE TWO KNOWN QUALITIES IF

21:04 THEY ARE THE PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEES.

21:08 THE KNEE-JERK REACTION FROM THE MARKET WILL BE POSITIVE WITH

21:15 TRUMP KNOWING HE WILL BRING PROGROWTH AND TAX POLICIES.

21:18 IT WILL BE MORE COMPLICATED BUT I'M SURE WE GET TO THAT IN

21:22 NOVEMBER. THAT IS LIKE A JANUARY EVENT.

21:24 LISA: I AM CURIOUS IF YOU EXPECT DEALMAKING TO ACCELERATE OR

21:27 DECELERATE BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY. CHRIS:

21:32 WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF DEALS ACROSS A WIDE VARIETY OF

21:34 INDUSTRIES THESE FIRST FEW WEEKS OF THE YEAR.

21:37 THEY TEND TO BE SMALL. SOME OF THAT IS PRODUCTIVE AND

21:42 AS THE MARKETS HAVE LOOSENED UP A LITTLE BIT AND WE HAVE MORE

21:45 CERTAINTY ON INFLATION AND COST. THAT BACKLOG HAS TO CLEAR.

21:48 I DON'T KNOW THAT ANYONE IS GOING TO ATTEMPT A BIG DEAL

21:53 BEFORE THE ELECTION. IF YOU ARE IT TODAY, IT IS

21:56 PROBABLY NOT GOING TO GET APPROVED IN TIME FOR THE

21:57 ELECTION TO OCCUR. ANNMARIE: INVESTORS MAY SHRUG OFF

22:03 POLITICAL RISK, WHAT ABOUT GEOPOLITICAL RISK?

22:06 EVERY SINGLE DAY THERE IS AN ISSUE IN THE RED SEA AND AT

22:09 SOME POINT THIS IS FEEDING INTO CORPORATE BUYER MONTHS --

22:13 CORPORATE BOTTOM LINES. CHRIS: PRESIDENT TRUMP SUGGESTS HE

22:17 WOULD SETTLE UKRAINE THE DAY AFTER YOU GET SELECTED.

22:21 WE CAN ALL QUESTION WHETHER THAT IS TRUE AND WHAT THE

22:25 IMPACT WOULD BE. JONATHAN: WE HOPE THAT IS THAT EASY.

22:30 I SUSPECT IT IS NOT. CHRIS: THERE IS A LOT OF FOCUS ON THE

22:35 MIDDLE EAST BECAUSE IT IS THE SOURCE OF A LOT OF THE WORLD'S

22:39 ENERGY AND HE RED SEA IS AN IMPORTANT TRADE ROUTE.

22:42 THIS IS GOING TO INCREASE COSTS AND SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS WHICH

22:45 ARE NOW ONLY NORMALIZING. JONATHAN:

22:51 THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. JUST WANT TO CHECK IN ARCHERS

22:55 ON NETFLIX, MAC PERCENT TO 10% THIS MORNING FOLLOWING BLOWOUT

23:01 NUMBERS, UP BY 9.9%. PLENTY OF REACTION ON THE

23:03 STREET. MARK MAHANEY SAYING Q4 PROFITS

23:09 WERE BETTER THEN ALREADY HIGH EXPECTATIONS, OUTPERFORMING THE

23:10 STOCK. THE PRICE TARGET, 600 FROM 500.

23:18 WE ARE 540.80 THIS MORNING. LISA:

23:21 PEOPLE ARE GOING TO PAY RATHER THAN HAVE THE SERVICE STRIPPED

23:23 FROM THEM AND THAT WAS THE UNKNOWN.

23:25 PEOPLE THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE A CANCELLATION STASH A LOT OF

23:28 CANCELLATIONS WITH THE PASSWORD CRACKDOWNS.

23:30 A LOT OF PEOPLE UNHAPPY. JONATHAN FERRO HAS TO PAY FOR

23:38 14 SERVICES AND MY TO GROEP ABOUT IT, BUT THEY ARE

23:39 ULTIMATELY PAYING FOR IT. JONATHAN:

23:42 THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO TOUCH ANY OF THIS, PEOPLE

23:46 WHO SIGN UP & OUT, PEOPLE LIKE ME, THE IDIOTS WHO PROVIDE ALL

23:51 OF THE MONEY TO THEM AND FORGET ABOUT THEM, NEVER CANCEL AND

23:52 USE THEM ONCE THE QUARTER. LISA: I HATE SIGNING UP FOR A SERVICE

23:57 BECAUSE I FEEL THERE IS NO WAY I AM GOING TO HAVE THE PATIENCE

24:00 TO FIGHT HAD TO CANCEL IT. JONATHAN:

24:03 I SIGNED UP FOR PARAMOUNT JUST TO MUCH ITALIAN FOOTBALL.

24:06 I CANNOT REMEDY LESS, WATCH THE GAME. LISA:

24:11 I AM ALSO ON PARAMOUNT BECAUSE JONATHAN TOLD ME THIS IS WORTH

24:15 THE FEE AND HAVE NOT CANCELED IT. JONATHAN:

24:17 I SHOULD TAKE ROYALTIES FROM PARAMOUNT.

24:22 COMING UP, TECHNIQUE'S UNDERWAY WITH TESLA AND IBM REPORTING

24:30 AFTER THE BELL -- TAKE IS -- TECH'S UNDERWAY WITH TESLA AND

24:46 JONATHAN: FOUR DAYS OF GAINS AS OF THE

24:49 FIVE LONGEST WINNING STREAK SINCE THE END OF DECEMBER.

24:51 EQUITY FUTURES LOOK LIKE THIS, POSITIVE.

24:56 WE HAD SOME WEIGHT TO IT, UP BY 4% ON THE S&P.

24:58 THE NASDAQ UP BY .6%. WE WILL TALK ABOUT NETFLIX

25:01 LATER. AT&T JUST DROPPING. LISA: CHRIS TALKING ABOUT HOW CABLE

25:10 PROVIDERS ARE TO TAKE ALL, IF SEEING A LOWER EARNINGS PER

25:12 SHARE EXPECTED.

25:19 TALKING ABOUT REVENUE GROWTH ON THE BROADBENT SIDE OF THAT, 7%.

25:25 GOING FORWARD, I'M CURIOUS WHAT WE SEE THEM START TO

25:29 CONSOLIDATE SOME OF THE SEXIER PARTS OF THE BUSINESS LIKE

25:33 CABLE AND CONTENT RATHER THAN JUST PAY MY BILL FOR THE

25:34 WIRELESS AND BROADBENT. IS THAT GOING TO TRANSPIRE AND

25:40 ELEVATED THEM TO THE NEXT POST UTILITY EXISTENCE? JONATHAN:

25:43 STOCK IS DOWN IN THE PREMARKET. BETS 10 TO THE BOND MARKET.

25:49 YIELDS COMING IN A FULL FOUR OR FIVE BASIS POINTS ON THE 10

25:50 YEAR.

25:57 -- A TWO YEAR, 10 YEAR, DOWN TO 4.1051 .

26:01 YIELDS HERE IN AMERICA ARE LOWER. LISA:

26:05 JAPAN IS IN A WORLD OF THEIR OWN.

26:10 JIM BULLARD, THE FORMER HEAD OF THYSSENKRUPP'S FEDERAL RESERVE

26:12 SAID HE COULD SEE THE FED CUTTING IN MARCH AND TALKED

26:15 ABOUT CUTTING RATES MORE AGGRESSIVELY BECAUSE THERE WAS

26:18 A WINDOW BEFORE CONVERSION GETS DOWN TO 4%.

26:21 A REAL PUSH-PULL AND YOU ARE SEEING MARKET BETS COME UP A

26:26 TOUCH. JONATHAN: I AM PLEASED ABOUT THE

26:28 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BOJ AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE.

26:33 WE ARE TALKING RATE CUT THE B -- AT THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND

26:35 HIKES IN THE BOJ. LISA: THEY LIKE TO DANCE TO THEIR

26:38 MUSIC. JONATHAN: IS THE FED -- LISA:

26:44 IS THE FED GIVING THEM A WINDOW TO HIKE RATES THAT THEY WANT TO

26:48 BLOCK THEIR CURRENCY THAT IT COULD OFFSET SOME OF THE GAINS?

26:51 A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE EXPECTING THIS, THE QUESTION IS HOW

26:54 THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT IN A LESS DESTRUCTIVE WAY.

26:58 TWO YEARS AGO WE SAID THIS WAS GOING TO BE DESTRUCTIVE FOR THE

26:59 MARKETS. IT HAS NOT BEEN AT NOW PEOPLE

27:05 ARE EXPECTING IN APRIL ABANDONMENT. JONATHAN:

27:10 I THINK I CALLED IT OPERATION OSTRICH, HEAD IN THE SAND.

27:13 IT HAS WORKED OUT SO FAR. A WEEK AWAY FROM A FEDERAL

27:16 RESERVE DECISION. 24 HOURS AWAY FROM AN ECB

27:20 DECISION. . THE FX MARKET IN THE EURO,

27:27 POSITIVE BY .3%. FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP

27:33 TAKING ANOTHER STEP TOWARD A REMATCH WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN.

27:36 TRUMP EASILY DEFEATING NIKKI HALEY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE POSTING

27:41 BACK-TO-BACK WINS AFTER IOWA. NIKKI HALEY VOWING TO STAY IN

27:46 THE RACE BUT OPTIONS FOR HER CAMPAIGN ARE RUNNING OUT.

27:50 AMH, WHAT JUMPS OUT TO YOU? ANNMARIE:

27:54 IT WAS NOT AS BAD FOR NIKKI HALEY IS THE POLLS WERE

27:57 EXPECTING BUT HE IS CONSOLIDATING HIS LEAD.

28:01 IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS GOING TO BE A

28:07 GENERAL DIRECTION -- GENERAL ELECTION REMATCH, TRAVERSES BY

28:10 THE. LISA: WHAT IS THE POINT OF NIKKI

28:13 HALEY STAYING IN? IS THIS BASICALLY A PLAY THAT

28:17 IF TRUMP'S LEGAL ISSUES BECOME ONEROUS, SHE CAN SOMEHOW TAKE

28:21 THE HELM? THE OTHER QUESTION IS DISSENT

28:24 AMONG BOTH PARTIES. WHAT HAPPENS IF IT IS THE

28:27 UNPOPULAR ELECTION? WE JUST HEARD THE PEOPLE ARE

28:32 NOT EXPECTED TO DO BIG DEALS BECAUSE HOW DO YOU DO A DEAL

28:34 THAT IS NOT GOING TO CLOSE ANY UNCERTAIN ELECTION? JONATHAN:

28:38 AND YOU MIGHT GET A REGULATOR IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.

28:41 I THINK WE ARE LEARNING SOMETHING.

28:46 WHERE THE INDEPENDENTS OUR LENDING AND WHAT THIS COULD

28:47 MEAN FOR THE PRESIDENT ON THE NATIONAL STAGE? ANNMARIE:

28:53 INDEPENDENTS WERE LEANING TOWARDS NIKKI HALEY SO THIS

28:56 SHOWS THAT TRUMP HAS A PROBLEM WHEN IT COMES TO THE GENERAL

28:57 ELECTION. I WAS CAUGHT BY THE STATEMENT

29:00 BY THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. DONALD TRUMP WILL FACE THE ONLY

29:04 PERSON HE WAS BEATEN AT THE BALLOT BOX.

29:08 THERE ONLY TWO PEOPLE YOU HAVE EVER FACED OFF, TRUMP IN A

29:10 GENERAL ELECTION AND THAT WAS CLINTON AND BIDEN.

29:12 THAT IS THEIR PITCH. JONATHAN: FACTS ARE NOT POPULAR IN

29:17 POLITICS. PLASTERED TO CHINA AND GET SOME

29:20 FACTS AT OF CHINA, 30'S MAKING ANY ATTEMPT TO BOOST THE

29:26 ECONOMY. RESIDUAL BANK ANNOUNCED A CUT

29:28 BY 50 BASIS POINTS. IT BECOMES OFFICIAL NEXT MONTH

29:33 IN AN ATTEMPT TO FREE UP LENDING.

29:37 CHINA'S ECONOMY WITH A RESCUE PACKAGE AS GROWTH WORRIES

29:43 CONTINUE. THIS IS BECOMING AN ISSUE, WE

29:46 ARE TALKING ABOUT THE EQUITY MARKET, THE CENTRAL BANK SANG

29:49 WE WOULD CREDIT SUPPLY INTO NEXT MONTH.

29:53 YOU GET THIS FEELING THAT THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF IT.

29:56 LISA: I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

29:57 GOAL IS. BY THE TRYING TO IGNITE LENDING? THE PROBLEM IS LOANS.

30:05 ARE THEY TRYING TO ENCOURAGE INTERNATIONAL INVESTORS TO COME

30:07 IN? THE BASICALLY BANNED CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS IN ONSHORE FUNDS

30:13 THAT HAD OFFSHORE ACCOUNTS. AT WHAT POINT DOES THIS HAVE

30:18 THE OPPOSITE EFFECT OF ATTRACTING INTERNATIONAL FLOWS

30:24 IF POLICY IS THAT UNCERTAIN AND NOT ACCORDING TO THE U.S.

30:26 VERSION OF A CAPITALISTIC ECONOMY? JONATHAN:

30:31 WITH THE LIVING SAID CAPITAL GOES TO WHERE IT IS BEST AND

30:34 RIGHT NOW THAT IS IN NETFLIX STOCK.

30:38 SURGING, TRADING IN FREE-MARKET TRADING AFTER REPORTING ITS

30:42 BEST QUARTER OF GROWTH SINCE THE PANDEMIC, OVER 13 MILLION

30:47 CUSTOMERS SIGNED UP THANKS TO A CHEAPER VERSION AND A CRACKDOWN

30:48 ON PASSWORD SHARING. MORNING THAT MORE PRICE HIKES

30:55 ON THE WAY SANG "AS WE INVEST IN AND IMPROVE NETFLIX, WE WILL

30:58 OCCASIONALLY ASK MEMBERS TO PAY EXTRA TO REFLECT THOSE

30:59 IMPROVEMENTS." LISA: IT IS BASICALLY THE NEW TAX OF

31:03 CAPITALISM. WHEN YOU SIGN UP FOR SOMETHING

31:09 AND IS AUTOMATICALLY PAID, YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT IT.

31:12 TODAY COULD JACK UP THE PRICE TWO DOLLARS A MONTH AND YOU

31:13 DON'T THINK ABOUT IT. I WONDER HOW MUCH THIS IS PART

31:19 OF THE DYNAMIC, WE WILL ASK OUR CUSTOMERS TO PAY MORE.

31:23 THEY ARE GOING TO KICK UP THE PRICE AND EVERYBODY'S WOULD YOU

31:27 PAY THAT. JONATHAN: DOES SOUND LIKE A CHARITY.

31:29 YOU'RE ARE ENJOYING THE PRODUCT SO MUCH. ANNMARIE:

31:32 IT IS NOT BAD IF THEY AT LEAST HAVE GOOD CONTENT.

31:35 CONTENT IS KING WHEN IT COMES TO NETFLIX.

31:39 THEY HAVE A HUGE LIBRARY AND PEOPLE KEEP ON TO NETFLIX

31:41 VERSUS ALL OF THE OTHERS. LISA: THAT IS THE KEY QUESTION, WHEN

31:49 DO THEY DROP THE OTHERS GIVEN THE FACT THAT AT SOME POINT IT

31:52 IS GOING TO BECOME OWNERS -- BECOME ONEROUS. JONATHAN:

31:55 MY BIBLE IS MORE THAN THE CABLE BUNDLE.

31:57 I AM GOING TO HAVE A SPRING CLEAN. LISA:

31:59 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO GET RID OF? JONATHAN:

32:03 APPLE IF WE STILL HAVE IT. PARAMOUNT. MAYBE THAT CAN GO.

32:15 HIGH GET THE DISNEY ESPN BUNDLE -- HULU GIVES ME THE DISNEY AND

32:18 ESPN BUNDLE BUT IT IS EXPENSIVE. I AM PAYING A FORTUNE FOR THAT

32:23 AND YOU PAY FOR BROADBAND CONNECTION.

32:29 CABLE IS ALL IN WITH BROADBAND AND COSTS $121?

32:35 $150? LISA: I PROBABLY PAY STUPID AMOUNTS I

32:41 NEED TO GO THROUGH, TOO. JONATHAN:

32:46 TESLA AND IBM AFTER THE BELL, TO THE LOOKING TO DELIVER AFTER

32:48 LOSING PACE AMONG THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN.

32:51 MANDEEP SINGH JOINS US NOW. IT HAS BEEN A STRUGGLE FOR

32:56 ABOUT THE EV'S. WE HEARD THE NEWS FROM HURTS,

33:02 WE HEARD FROM FORD IF YOU DOES AGO -- A FEW DAYS AGO.

33:05 TO VISIT A STRUGGLE FROM INTEL OR IS IT DIFFERENT? MANDEEP:

33:09 IT IS ALL ABOUT EXPECTATIONS. WHAT NETFLIX DID WAS A CASE OF

33:14 LOW EXPECTATIONS AND THEN PULLING THE LEVERS.

33:19 IN THE CASE OF TESLA, I WOULD ARGUE EXPECTATIONS HAVE COME

33:21 DOWN BUT CLEARLY A LOT IS PINNED ON HOPE AROUND AI AND

33:26 WHAT THEY CAN DO AROUND ROBOTAXIS.

33:29 THEY HAVE NOT GIVEN ANY CONCRETE TODAY TO POINTS ON HOW

33:35 THEY PLAN TO MONETIZE THAT BUSINESS EXCEPT TO CHARGE

33:37 AROUND $12,000 YOU HAVE TO PAY.

33:43 THAT IS ALSO A LOW INSTALL BASE OF CONSUMERS, THE TESLA USERS

33:45 WHO HAVE UPDATED TO THAT. THAT IS WHERE TOPLINE GROWTH

33:52 CONTINUES TO BE HIGHER THAN THE OTHER OEMS. THE EVALUATION

33:55 DEPENDS ON THE SOFTWARE. LISA:

34:03 ELON MUSK CAME OUT WITH A TWEET SAYING TESLA IS AN AI COMPANY

34:06 WITH A CAR OPERATION PINNED ON. HOW MUCH IS THAT GOING TO BE

34:09 BORNE OUT IN EARNINGS? IF THEY DISAPPOINT WITH CAR

34:14 DELIVERIES THEY CAN STILL DO WELL IF THEY EXPLAIN HOW THEY

34:19 ARE AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE COMPANY AND NOT ONE THAT SIMPLY

34:21 MANUFACTURES CARS. MANDEEP:

34:27 MORE SO NOW WITH THIS WAIVER AI, THE FOCUS ON MODELS AND HOW

34:30 MUCH DATA YOU NEED TO TRAIN THESE MODELS COME IT TAKES THE

34:34 QUESTION. TESLA HAS ABOUT 5 MILLION

34:36 VEHICLES, A RUN RATE OF -- EVERY YEAR.

34:40 THEY COULD KEEP AGGREGATING THOSE MILES TO TRAIN E-MODELS.

34:44 WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY NOW WITH THESE FOUNDATIONAL MODELS.

34:51 TESLA IN THEORY SHOULD BE LEADING THE PACK WHEN IT COMES

34:53 TO AUTONOMOUS DRIVING AND THEY ARE THE MOST COMMITTED.

34:57 THEY NEED TO ARTICULATE THAT IN TERMS OF HOW THEY'RE GOING TO

34:59 MONETIZE IT AND PEOPLE WILL BUY INTO THAT STORY. LISA:

35:06 TESLA IS A ROBOTICS AI COMPANY THAT APPEARS TO BE A CAR

35:13 COMPANY.

35:14 BYD OVER WHELMING -- OVER LOOMING OVER ELON MUSK'S HEAD,

35:19 EBBING UP THIS COMPETITION. HOW MUCH ARE THE CHINESE EV

35:27 MANUFACTURERS EATING ELON MUSK'S LUNCH? MANDEEP:

35:35 TESLA'S TREASURES WERE USED BY -- THAT IS VALUATION THAT TESLA

35:40 THE FOOTPRINT BEING THE EARLY COMPANY RIGHT EV IS THAT HAVING

35:46 THE INFRASTRUCTURE. LET'S SAY OTHER OEMS START

35:49 LICENSING THEIR SOFTWARE, THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER BIG POLITICIAN.

35:56 -- ANOTHER BIG EVALUATION -- VALIDATION. THEY DON'T HAVE THE

36:00 INFRASTRUCTURE WHEN IT COMES TO CHARGING STATIONS AND OTHER

36:04 THINGS YOU NEED. ANNMARIE:

36:06 WHEN YOU LOOK AT AUTONOMOUS DRIVING, MARK OF BLOOMBERG IS

36:09 TALKING ABOUT APPLE, THEY WANT THIS TRULY DRIVERLESS CAR.

36:13 IT SEEMS LIKE THEY ARE SHORTING THOSE AMBITIONS AND BRINGING AN

36:14 EV TO MARKET. WHAT IS GOING ON THERE? MANDEEP:

36:20 YOU ARE SEEING DIFFERENT APPROACHES FROM DIFFERENT OEM'S.

36:25 TESLA, THEY HAVE THE LEAD EVEN THOUGH YOU COULD ARGUE LEVEL

36:30 FIVE AUTONOMOUS DRIVING IS HARD AND NOBODY THINKS TESLA'S

36:35 CURRENT SOFTWARE IS LEVEL FIVE, THEY LEVEL TWO AND THREE.

36:39 EVERY OEM IS STRUGGLING TO COME UP WITH A STRATEGY.

36:43 THEY HAVE NOT FIGURED OUT WHAT THE BEST COMBINATION OF SENSORS

36:47 IS, WHETHER YOU NEED A LIDAR OR JUST BUILD A CAMERA BASED

36:50 FIGURE. THANKS WILL GET PUSHED OUT WHEN

36:52 IT GETS TO LEVEL FIVE DRIVING. JONATHAN: APPRECIATE THE UPDATE.

36:55 MANDEEP SINGH THERE. WE WILL HEAR FROM TESLA LATER.

37:01 LET'S HEAR FROM STORIES ELSEWHERE. .

37:06 HIS THAT SHE IS THE BLOOMBERG UPDATE -- THE BLOOMBERG.

37:09 REEF -- HERE IS THE YAHAIRA: BLOOMBERG BRIEF YAHAIRA:

37:11 -- AND EXTEND FOR A MONTH-LONG PAUSE IN FIGHTING.

37:15 MEDIATORS ARE PUSHING FOR A PHASED APPROACH THAT WOULD

37:17 START WITH CIVILIANS AND END WITH SOLDIERS IN RETURN FOR A

37:22 BREAK AND HAS TO THAT THESE, THE RELEASE OF PALESTINIAN

37:23 PRISONERS AND MORE AID TO GAZA. SAP WILL RESTRUCTURE ITS

37:30 WORKFORCE TO INCREASE FOCUS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,

37:31 AFFECTING ABOUT 50,000 JOBS.

37:38 -- 8000 JOBS.

37:40 >> WE ARE APPLYING AI INTERNALLY.

37:43 WE EXPECT AT THE END OF THE YEAR WE END UP WITH THE SAME

37:46 HEADCOUNT AS 2023 AND FOR THE USED TO COME THERE WILL BE

37:49 INVESTMENTS. UNDER PROPORTIONAL TO OUR

37:53 TOPLINE QUOTES. YAHAIRA:

37:59 THE SOFTWARE COMPANY'S SHARES SURGED.

38:04 AFTER RYAN GOSLING PUSHED BACK ON BYBEE'S -- BARBIE'S

38:13 NOMINATIONS, HE IS UP FOR NOMINATION WHEN MARGOT ROBBIE

38:14 AND GET A ARE LEFT OUT. "TO SAY I'M DISAPPOINTED WOULD

38:18 BE AN UNDERSTATEMENT." JONATHAN: I, SAYING ANYTHING.

38:23 THE FLOOR IS YOURS. LISA: I KNOW IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE

38:29 ABOUT FEMA EMPOWERMENT, BUT THE PROBLEM IS THE MEN ARE THE BEST

38:30 CHARACTERS. THEY ARE FUNNY AND CREATIVELY

38:33 PLOT. -- AND CREATE THE PLOT.

38:40 YOU ARE SHAKING YOUR HEAD, BUT IT IS COUNTERINTUITIVE.

38:42 ANNMARIE: I AM LOOKING AT RYAN GOSLING'S

38:49 STATEMENT, THERE IS NO KEN WITHOUT BARBIE.

38:52 HOW DOES BYBEE GET SNUBBED? -- BARBIE GET SNUBBED? JONATHAN:

38:58 IS THIS WHY YOU ARE WEARING PINK? ANNMARIE:

39:01 IT IS NOT WHAT I AM GLAD I DID. JONATHAN:

39:04 IT IS LIKE DOWN WITH THE PATRIARCHY AND THEN THEY

39:09 NOMINATE KEN. LISA:

39:17 THE SWAG FROM THAT WAS I AM KENOUGH. JONATHAN:

39:19 THERE WERE OTHER NOMINATIONS FROM THE MOVIE. ANNMARIE:

39:23 AMERICA FERRERA. SHE IS DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE THE

39:27 DIRECTOR MADE A CAMPAIGN, THEY HAD SO MUCH MONEY.

39:31 BARBIE HERSELF GOT SNUBBED. THE WHOLE POINT OF THE MOVIE

39:35 WAS DOWN WITH THE PATRIARCHY AND YET KEN MADE IT OUT ON TOP.

39:40 AWARDS ARE NOT CHARITY. JONATHAN:

39:44 THERE IS NO UPSIDE FOR ME TO SAY ANYTHING.

39:46 LET'S SIT THIS ONE OUT. ECB AND THE FED ON DECK.

39:57 >> ICA SLOPE -- I SEE A SLOPED DOWNWARD, BUT CERTAINLY NOT A

39:58 SLOPE WHICH IS AT TARGET. JONATHAN:

40:01 THAT CONVERSATION IS COMING UP NEXT.

40:05 YOU ARE WATCHING "BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE."

40:28 JONATHAN: THE BEST THING THAT HAS

40:31 HAPPENED THIS WEEK, WE SEVER,

40:38 WITH VERSUS AMH ON "BARBIE -- BRAMO VERSUS AMH ON "BARBIE."

40:48 MAYBE AND REORDER'S -- MAYBE ANNMARIE'S THE WAS UNPOPULAR.

40:52 THE FED AND ECB ON DECK.

40:57 >> WHEN I LOOK AT A YEAR AGO ON DOUBLES AND COMPARE THAT WITH

41:03 WHERE WE ARE TODAY, I SEE A SLOPED DOWNWARD -- SLOPE

41:07 DOWNWARD BUT NOT AS LOW AS TARGET.

41:11 WHEN WE SAID WE ARE DETERMINED, WE WENT TO GET TO 2%, I WOULD

41:15 SAY WE ARE CONFIDENT WE WILL GET IT TO THAT TARGET. JONATHAN:

41:21 INVESTORS SPENDING ON GLOBAL CENTRAL BANKS, TOMORROW THE

41:25 FEDERAL RESERVE DECISION. I AM NOT SAYING IT IS GOING TO

41:31 HAPPEN IN MARCH OR ANYTIME SOON, BUT THAT IS THE DIRECTION

41:33 BASED ON COMMUNICATION LIKE THAT. LISA:

41:37 THE KEY FOR ME IS HOW FAR ARE THEY GOING TO CUT A GIVEN THAT

41:38 THEY GOT FISHING WRONG. -- THEY GOT INFLATION WRONG.

41:46 AN ECONOMIST WRITING IN THE FT WRITING IT IS ONCE BITTEN TWICE

41:48 SHY AND POLICYMAKERS WANT TO MAKE SURE THE INFLATION GENIE

41:52 HAS BEEN PUT BACK IN THE BOTTLE. Q2 IS THE PERFECT TIME FOR CUTS.

41:58 THIS IS THE BIG DIVERGENCE, NOT WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO CUT

42:00 BUT WHETHER THEY GOING TO CUT MORE AGGRESSIVELY OR TAKE

42:05 CAUTION FROM THE FACT THAT THEY GOT INFLATION SO LONG IN THE

42:06 AFTERMATH OF THE PANDEMIC. LISA: -- JONATHAN:

42:14 LET'S GET INTO IT WITH JOHN RYDING FROM BREAN CAPITAL.

42:19 HOW CONFIDENT ARGUE THAT WE ARE ON A GLAD BIKE -- A GLIDE BACK

42:23 TO 2%? JOHN:

42:29 CONFIDENT GIVEN BOTH CENTRAL BANKS CONTINUE TO PUSH BACK

42:30 AGAINST THE MARKETS. HERE IS THE POINT AND I THINK

42:35 GOVERNOR WALZ RELATED OUT REASONABLY WELL.

42:37 THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CUTTING INTEREST RATES AND

42:39 EASING POLICY. THIS IS NOT BEEN COMMUNICATED

42:42 WELL. INFLATION IS FALLING AND AS A

42:49 PATIENT FALLS, INTEREST RATES ARE ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION AND

42:50 REAL INTEREST RATES GET HIGHER.

42:56 DOES THE FED AND ECB WANT TO BE TIGHTENING POLICY BY NOT

42:58 LOWERING THE POLICY RATE AS INFLATION APPROACHES TO PERCENT?

43:01 THE ANSWER IS NO. THE MARKET IS GOING

43:06 DIFFERENTLY, PUTTING IN HIS AGGRESSIVE CUTS AND AGGRESSIVE

43:08 CUTS HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN TO FIGHT A RECESSION OR POTENTIAL

43:13 RECESSION WHEN INFLATION HAS BEEN RELATIVELY UNDER CONTROL.

43:17 I THINK THE CENTRAL BANKS HAVE DRIVEN ON A COUPLE OF MESSAGES.

43:20 WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT 2%. SECONDLY, WE ARE NOT GOING TO

43:24 CUT AGGRESSIVELY. WE ARE GOING TO KEEP POLICY

43:28 RESTRICTIVE WHILE WE LOWER RATES.

43:31 THAT IS THE SUBTLE POINT THE MARKETS ARE MISSING. JONATHAN:

43:35 WHAT KIND OF LANGUAGE WOULD YOU EXPECT NEXT WEEK?

43:39 THINGS LIKE WE NEED TO CALIBRATE POLICY, JUST RATES,

43:41 SURGICAL RATE CUTS? JOHN:

43:47 THINGS LIKE THAT, BUT THE MAIN THING IS THE FED AND POWELL IS

43:51 NOT GOING TO BE IN A POSITION TO GREENLIGHT A RATE CUT IN

43:52 MARCH. I THINK THE FED IS THINKING

44:00 PROBABLY JUNE AT THE EARLIEST. THEY ARE PROBABLY GOING TO BE

44:01 PUSHING. THERE IS NO NEW INTEREST RATE

44:07 TO COME OUT AT THIS MEETING FOR THEM TO FRAME THE DISCUSSION.

44:12 THE PROBLEM IS POWELL DID A VERY POOR JOB IN DECEMBER

44:18 OPENING UP AND TALKING ABOUT RIGHT CUTS TO THE POINT WHERE

44:21 JOHN WILLIAMS ON THE NEW YORK FED HAD TO GO ON A DIFFERENT

44:25 CHANNEL TWO DAYS LATER TO TRY AND SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT.

44:34 HE NEEDS TO DO A BETTER JOB LAYING OUT THAT WHEN WE CUT

44:36 RATES, IT IS NOT ABOUT EASING POLICY AGGRESSIVELY.

44:40 IT IS ABOUT PREVENTING IT FROM BECOMING TIGHT.

44:47 THE FED HAS NOT LAID OUT A STRATEGY IN A WAY THAT IS

44:49 CLEAR, STRATEGY FOR RUNNING MONETARY POLICY.

44:54 THEY HAVE DONE A LOT OF DISCRETIONARY POLICY, SEAT OF

44:55 THE PANTS STUFF. THAT LEAVES THE MARKETS TO

45:00 OVERLAY THEIR OWN INTERPRETATION.

45:04 FOR SIGNALED THREE RATE CUTS AND A DECEMBER -- THEY SIGNALED

45:09 THREE RATE CUTS ANTIMARKET TOOK SIX AND A DECEMBER. LISA:

45:12 YOU THINK THEIR JOB PUSHBACK ON ALL OF THE BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN.

45:17 PRIYA MISRA WAS SITTING IN HER SEAT AND SAID SHE IS THE MOST

45:22 BULLISH ON HIGH-YIELD BONDS THAN WE HAVE SEEN IN A LONG

45:24 TIME. ARE WE GOOD TO HEAR PUSHBACK

45:26 FROM THE CENTRAL BANKERS THIS WEEK AND NEXT? JOHN:

45:31 WE ARE GOING TO HEAR PUSHBACK AS WE HEARD LAST WEEK FROM

45:35 WALLER, AS WE HEARD IN THAT CLIP YOU HAD FROM PRESIDENT

45:44 LAGARDE, THAT THE MARKETS AHEAD -- MARKETS ARE AHEAD OF WHERE

45:45 THE CENTRAL BANKS ARE. WE ARE NOT OUT OF THE BANKS --

45:48 OUT OF THE WOODS YET IN HAVING A RECESSION.

45:55 THAT IS ONE THING I HAVE NOT FIGURED OUT IN MARKETS IS YOU

45:57 HAVE RISK ASSETS LIKE HIGH-YIELD BONDS PRICING IN A

46:01 GOOD ECONOMY AND YOU HAVE THE INTEREST RATE MARKETS PRICING

46:04 IN A RECESSION. THE FED IS GOING TO CUT RATES

46:09 THAT AGGRESSIVELY, WE WILL PROBABLY BE IN RECESSION AND

46:12 THAT IS WHEN SPREADS BLOWOUT. THAT IS WHERE THERE IS A

46:16 DISCONNECTEDNESS BETWEEN THE RICH MARKET AND IS SPREAD

46:17 MARKETS. LISA: THERE IS ONLY -- IF YOU THINK

46:24 PEOPLE OF GOTTEN AHEAD OF THEMSELVES AND THIS IDEA THAT

46:28 INFLATION WILL NATURALLY COME DOWN AS SUPPLY CHAIN EFFECTS

46:31 PANDEMIC RELATED CONSEQUENCES EVAPORATE.

46:33 ARGUE PUSHING BACK ON THAT? DO YOU THINK THE INFLATION RATE

46:38 IS HIGHER NOW THAN IT WAS IN 2019? JOHN:

46:44 I THINK IN 2019, THE PREDOMINANT QUESTION OF THE

46:47 CENTRAL BANKS WAS HOW DO WE GET INFLATION TO 2%?

46:52 NOW IT IS HOW DO WE GET DOWN TO 2%? CENTRAL BANK'S ARE GIVING US

46:55 SOMETHING WE RARELY SEE. YOU HAVE THE BANK OF JAPAN

46:59 WHICH HAS NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES AND EASING MONETARY

47:05 POLICY, VERSUS THE BANK OF CANADA, VERSUS THE FED, VERSUS

47:08 THE ECB AND THE BANK OF ENGLAND WHO HAVE A MUCH TIGHTER POLICY.

47:13 IF IT IS ALL ABOUT SUPPLY CHAINS, INFLATION WILL COME

47:16 DOWN IN JAPAN. JAPAN HAS HAD UPWARD PRESSURE

47:19 ON INFLATION AND THEY MAY CONTINUE TO HAVE UPWARD

47:20 PRESSURE ON INFLATION UNTIL THEY TAKE ACTION.

47:31 IT IS AN ART -- ODD WORLD WERE HAVING INTEREST RATES IS

47:34 CONSIDERED HAWKISH WHICH IS THE INTERPRETATION OF YESTERDAY'S

47:36 BOJ MEETING. INFLATION IS ABOUT MONETARY

47:39 POLICY.

47:45 IT IS ONE OF THOSE PHYSICALS OF ECONOMICS, I BELIEVE INFLATION

47:46 IS A MONETARY PHENOMENON. THAT IS NOT ME TO SAY THAT --

47:53 ARE NOT IMPORTANT, BUT THAT DOES NOT BECOME INFLATION IF

47:54 THIS BANK PUSHES BACK ON IT. 2021 WAS A DISASTER.

48:02 WHILE INFLATION WAS PICKING UP, THE FEDERAL RESERVE UNLEASHED

48:06 THE INFLATION JEANNIE AND THEY HAD FOUR CONSECUTIVE THREE

48:12 QUARTER-POINT RATE HIKES IN THE MID TO LATE 2022 TO PUSH THAT

48:13 BACK IN. WE HAVE NOT HAD THE RECESSION

48:15 YET. THEY HAVE DONE WELL GETTING AWAY WITH IT.

48:21 THEY DON'T WANT TO THROW IN THE TOWEL.

48:24 WHAT IS THE COST OF CURRENT INTEREST RATES.

48:28 IF THE FED WERE TO CUT AGGRESSIVELY AND THEN FIND WE

48:31 MADE A MISTAKE, INFLATION HAS NOT COME BACK INTO THE BOTTLE,

48:36 HAS NOT STAYED IN THE BOTTLE, THAT IS THE SCENARIO THEY WANT

48:37 TO AVOID. JONATHAN: THE RISK CUTS BOTH WAYS.

48:44 JOHN RYDING OF BREAN CAPITAL. 2021 WAS A DISASTER, WILL 2024

48:48 BE A DISASTER? DECEMBER WAS A MESSY MEETING

48:52 FROM TRUMAN POWELL. IS DIFFICULT TO FIND THE

48:58 CONSENSUS IN THAT COMMITTEE AND THE MINUTE THAT CAME OF THE

48:59 DRONE. LISA: HE UNLEASHED ANIMAL SPIRIT,

49:04 SOME PEOPLE COULD ARGUE. HOW DO YOU PUT THAT BACK?

49:08 TO GET MORE AGGRESSIVE TO GET MORE AGGRESSIVE DO GUT CHECK

49:10 THE MARKET'S ENTHUSIASM? JONATHAN:

49:14 WHEN THE NEW YORK FED PRESIDENT HAS TO COME OUT AND CORRECT

49:17 THINGS AND IT DIDN'T WORK, SOMETHING HAS GONE WRONG.

49:41 >> EVERYONE BELIEVES THE NEXT MOVE BY THE FED IS A GUT -- A

49:43 CUT WHICH MEANS PEOPLE CAN REPAIR FOR THAT.

49:47 >> THIS IS MOVE GRADUALLY AND METHODICALLY.

49:50 >> WHAT MATTERS IS THE END POINT.

49:52 WHAT ARE THEY CUTTING AT WHAT IS THE REASON THEY ARE CUTTING?

49:57 >> YOU CAN DELIVER WHAT IS PRESSED INTO THE CURVE OR EVEN

49:59 LESS AND HAVE YIELDS FAIRLY STABLE.

50:02 >> PEOPLE ARE ABLE -- ARE WILLING TO THROW IN THE TOWEL.

50:08 WHAT WE HAVE SEEN THIS MONTH IS PEOPLE CAPITULATING.

50:15 >> THIS IS "BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE "

50:16 WITH JONATHAN FERRO, LISA ABRAMOWICZ, AND AN RECORDER.

50:18 JONATHAN: GOOD MORNING TO OUR AUDIENCE

50:20 WORLDWIDE.

50:20 ALONGSIDE LISA ABRAMOWICZ AND ANNMARIE HORDERN, I AM JONATHAN

50:27 FERRO. FOUR DAYS OF GAINS ON THE S&P,

50:33 THE LONGEST WINNING STREAK OF THE YEAR SO FAR, THREE

50:34 CONSECUTIVE ALL-TIME HIGHS. JUICING THINGS A BIT THIS

50:36 MORNING. NETFLIX, KNOCKING IT OUT OF THE

50:39 PARK. LISA:

50:45 THE RALLY WE HAVE SEEN AND RECORD HIGHS DRIVEN BY BIG

50:46 TECH, THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. WE SAW THE BIGGEST TWO WEEK

50:52 INFLOWS RELATED TO TECH FUNDS GOING BACK TO AUGUST. THEY ARE

50:55 THE ONES DELIVERING, SUPPORTING A LOT OF THE EARNINGS.

50:59 HOW LONG BEFORE EVERYTHING ELSE CATCHES UP? JONATHAN:

51:02 THE BEST QUARTER FOR SUBGROUPS SINCE THE PANDEMIC, BEATING

51:06 PROJECTIONS IN EVERY REGION OF THE WORLD. LISA:

51:10 THE TALLY WALL STREET WAS EXPECTING WAS $8.91.

51:14 THEY ARE 13.1 MILLION NEW CUSTOMERS.

51:18 THIS IS AFTER EVERYBODY SIGNED UP DURING THE PANDEMIC BECAUSE

51:21 THEY WERE TORTURED WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND WHAT TO DO WITH

51:22 THEM. I AM JUST SAYING.

51:28 ANNMARIE: THIS INDICATES THE INCREDIBLE

51:30 GROWTH -- LISA: THIS INDICATES THINKING ABOUT

51:33 GROWTH. BY THE TAKING OVER FOR SOMEONE

51:36 ELSE OR JUST CAPITALIZING ON PEOPLE'S NEED FOR ENTERTAINMENT?

51:41 JONATHAN: ANOTHER BIG WIN FOR THE FORMER

51:44 PRESIDENT AFTER ANOTHER BIG WIN IN IOWA. ANNMARIE:

51:48 HE HAS BACK-TO-BACK WINS, IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE.

51:53 EMERGENT HE WON BIG THAT SHE WON WAS NOT AS BIG AS PEOPLE

51:58 EXPECTED -- THE MARGIN HE WON WAS NOT AS BIG AS PEOPLE

51:59 EXPECTED. IF YOU LOOK AHEAD TO SOUTH

52:04 CAROLINA, IT IS 30 OR 40 POINTS HE IS UP.

52:07 THAT IS HER HOME STATE. LISA: WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT WISE

52:13 NIKKI HALEY STILL IN THE RACE, ISSUE WAITING FOR DONALD TRUMP

52:16 TO HAVE TO BOW OUT FOR SOME REASON?

52:19 THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS WHERE OUR INDEPENDENTS GOING TO

52:21 GO? THEY SEEM TO BE MIGRATING AWAY

52:26 FROM TRUMP MORE THAN THEY DID IN 2016. JONATHAN:

52:31 EQUITY FUTURES ON THE S&P 500 POSITIVE BY 0.4%.

52:34 BOND YIELDS LOWER. OVER IN JAPAN, THE MARKETS

52:39 SELLING OFF A TOUCH.

52:46 YIELDS HIGHER, RATE CUTS AT THE FED MAYBE RATE HIKES AT THE BOJ.

52:49 LISA: WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY START

52:50 TRADING? HOW MUCH OF THE MARKET IS OWNED

52:53 BY THE CENTRAL BANK OF JAPAN? JONATHAN: SOMETHING LIKE HALF.

52:58 LISA: AT A CERTAIN POINT, OKAY, BUT

53:03 THEY ARE MOVING IN A DIRECTION -- A DIFFERENT DIRECTION AND

53:04 HOW MUCH OF THE USA OPEN THEM TO DO IT'S DIFFERENT DO IT

53:08 FURTHER -- TO DO IT FURTHER? JONATHAN:

53:11 FIVE BASIS POINTS TO SOMETHING. COMING UP, GARY COHN, THE VICE

53:24 CHAIRMAN OF IBM JOINING US. THE FORMER PRESIDENT TAKES

53:26 ANOTHER STEP TOWARD THE GOP NOMINATION AND MICHAEL AND AT

53:31 THE CENTER ON A NETFLIX'S BLOCKBUSTER QUARTER.

53:35 WE BEGIN WITH OUR TOP STORY, ONE WEEK OUT FROM THE FIRST FED

53:38 DECISION OF THE YEAR, A STRING OF STRONG THAN EXPECTED DATE OF

53:41 THESE ECONOMISTS SPLIT ON THE TIMING OF CUTS.

53:47 INFLATION IS SLOWLY, RELATIVELY QUICKLY TOWARDS TARGET.

53:51 LABOR MARKETS ARE SLOWING BUT NOT SLOWING AS QUICKLY.

53:54 THE NET EFFECT OF THAT IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO'S NET INCOMES.

54:00 IT IS NOT AN ECONOMY FIRING ON ALSO LENDERS BUT FIRING ON

54:05 ENOUGH CYLINDERS. AT THE TABLE WITH US, GARY COHN.

54:09 I WAS REVERTING ON COMPOSITIONS WE USED TO HAVE WHEN YOU WERE

54:11 IN FRONT OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND USED THIS TERM THE THREES.

54:16 ARE WE GOING BACK TO THE THREES? GARY:

54:20 IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE ARE GOING BACK TO THE THREES.

54:25 I WAS TALKING ABOUT 3% GDP, 3% UNEMPLOYMENT, AND 3% WAGE

54:26 GROWTH. THAT WAS A SWEET SPOT WE WERE

54:30 TRYING TO ACHIEVE AT THE TIME. WE THOUGHT THAT WAS A REALLY

54:33 GOOD SOLID PLACE FOR THE U.S. ECONOMY. THAT WAS THE GOAL.

54:41 THAT WAS THE MIDDLE OF THE TARGET WE WERE TRYING TO HIT

54:45 MONTH AFTER MONTH WHEN WE TALK ON THOSE FRIDAYS AFTER WE

54:46 RELEASE JOB DATA. JONATHAN: HAVE WE FORGOTTEN WHAT NORMAL

54:49 IS? GARY: WE HAVE TOTALLY FORGOTTEN WHAT

54:52 NORMAL IS. JONATHAN: WHAT IS NORMAL?

54:58 GARY: THIS IS A CAMPAIGN I AM ON, WE

54:59 HAVE FORGOTTEN WHAT NORMAL IS. TO GO BACK TO WHAT NORMAL IS,

55:05 WE HAVE TO GO TO THE POST 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS.

55:08 SINCE 2008, THE FED HAS BEEN THE OVERWHELMING DOMINANT

55:11 FEATURE OF FINANCIAL MARKETS.

55:17 FED MEETINGS WERE IMPORTANT BUT WE DID NOT LIVE AND DIE OFF OF

55:18 FED MEETINGS. I AM OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER

55:21 WHEN MONEY SUPPLY DROVE MARKETS. I AM DATING MYSELF THERE.

55:28 WE GET TO 2008 AND THE FED GOES INTO THE POLICY OF ZERO

55:31 INTEREST RATES AND QUANTITATIVE EASING.

55:34 FOLLOWED BY MANY OTHER CENTRAL BANKS AROUND THE WORLD.

55:39 AS THE FED GOES INTO THE ZERO INTEREST RATE POLICY AND THEY

55:42 BUILD A BIGGER BALANCE SHEETS, THEY BECOME THE DOMINANT FACTOR

55:43 IN FINANCIAL MARKETS. NOT JUST IN THE FIXED INCOME

55:48 MARKETS, BUT WHEN YOU LITERALLY HAVE SEWER RATES OF RETURN, YOU

55:52 ARE FORCING PEOPLE OUT INTO THE RISK SPECTRUM.

55:58 YOU BRING MANY OTHER ASSET CLASSES THAT HISTORICALLY HAVE

55:59 NOT BEEN APPEALING TO PEOPLE. YOU BRING THEM INTO PLAY.

56:05 THE SEARCH FOR RETURN, FOR YIELDS, YOU GO FARTHER OUT ON

56:07 THE RISK FACTOR. ALL THE WAY UP TO COVID WITH

56:12 THIS ZERO INTEREST RATE POLICY, PEOPLE LOOKING FOR ALTERNATIVE

56:18 ASSETS, PEOPLE LOOKING FOR YIELDS AND SEARCHING FOR IT IN

56:19 UNUSUAL PLACES. WE COME INTO THE UNUSUAL COVID

56:23 PERIOD AND THE FED STAYS IN THE ZERO INTEREST RATE POLICY.

56:27 THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS HAPPENING.

56:29 I AM NOT SURE THAT IS A MISTAKE. ALL OF A SUDDEN WE GET INTO THE

56:36 BIDEN ADMINISTRATION AND WE HAVE GOT THROUGH FIVE STIMULUS

56:41 PACKAGES IN THE U.S. -- GONE THROUGH FIVE SEAMLESS

56:42 PACKAGES IN THE U.S. AND U.S. CONSUMERS WITH THE BEST BALANCE

56:49 SHEETS IN THEIR LIFE, DISPOSABLE INCOME AND THE

56:52 ABILITY TO SPEND IT AFTER NOT HAVING THE ABILITY OF ALMOST

56:58 TWO YEARS WHAT YOU CANNOT BUY AT THE GROCERY STORE OR FEDEX

57:01 CANNOT DELIVER TO YOU. LO AND BEHOLD WE END UP IN A

57:05 HIGHLY INFLATIONARY CYCLE. THE FED GOES FROM THIS ZERO

57:12 INTEREST RATE TRY TO DRIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH, TRYING TO

57:13 DRIVE INFLATION. I REMIND MY BEST FRIENDS, IF

57:22 YOU PICKED UP A NEWSPAPER PRIOR TO 2008 TO THE 2020 PERIOD, THE

57:25 HEADLINE WOULD HAVE BEEN CAN THE FED ERIC REED INFLATION

57:26 AGAIN? WE ARE BACK AND IT IS HIGHLY

57:31 INFLATED PERIOD AND THE FED GOES FROM QUANTITATIVE EASING

57:36 TO QUANTITATIVE TIGHTENING TO 50 BASIS POINTS MONTH IN AND

57:38 MONTH OUT. WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS 15

57:42 PLUS YEARS CYCLE OF WHAT I WOULD CALL ABNORMAL.

57:46 ON TOP OF THAT, WE END UP WITH THIS INVERTED YIELD CURVE.

57:49 EVERYONE IS CONVINCED OF THE FED IS RAISING RATES.

57:52 THE FED HAS JUST DOWN THE ECONOMY. WE HAVE TO SEE DROPPED

57:55 AGGREGATION. -- JOB AGGREGATION. -- DEGRADATION.

58:04 WE STILL HAVE ANY INVERTED YIELD CURVE WHICH I DON'T THINK

58:05 IS NORMAL. NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIS

58:11 15 YEAR PERIOD, WE ARE GETTING TO A POSITION WHERE WE ARE

58:16 STARTING AND JUST AT THE BEGINNING OF HEADING BACK

58:18 TOWARD NORMAL AND WHAT NORMAL WOULD BE.

58:22 REMINDING PEOPLE WHAT NORMAL WOULD LOOK LIKE, GOING BACK TO

58:28 THE 3, 3, 3 BUT WE HAD A POSITIVELY SHAPED YIELD CURVE,

58:29 WE HAVE A RISK PREMIUM. IF YOU LOOK AT 10 YEAR YIELDS,

58:34 THE U.S. YOU CAN EITHER PUT IN THE

58:40 VOLCKER FED OR TAKE OUT THE VOLCKER FED, WITHIN THE VOLCKER

58:44 FED, IT IS -- LISA: IF YOU PUT ASIDE ALL OF THIS, IF YOU LOOK

58:50 AT THE FED AND SAY IT IS ON THE BACK TABLE, YOU LOOK AT THE

58:52 ECONOMY, IT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD. IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE WE ARE

58:55 GOING INTO RECESSION. WHY DO PEOPLE FEEL SO BAD? GARY:

59:03 THE INFLATION NUMBER, THE INFLATION DATA IS THE MOST

59:05 PECULIAR DATA WE HAVE IN THE U.S.

59:09 WE CANNOT ENVISION MONTH OVER MONTH FOR YEAR-OVER-YEAR, WE

59:12 DON'T ZERO BASELINE IT ANYWHERE. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT INFLATION,

59:16 WE TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH INFLATION OVER THE LAST MONTH.

59:20 IF WE HAVE INFLATION MONTH OVER MONTH, THAT MEANS WHAT YOU ARE

59:21 PAYING THIS MONTH IS HIGHER. IF WE HAVE INFLATION

59:25 YEAR-OVER-YEAR, SAME THING. WE HAVE SEEN THE COMPOUNDING

59:31 EFFECT OF A 3% INFLATION YEAR, 9% INFLATION YEAR.

59:34 , THAT ADDS UP TO 20%. IF YOU ARE A HARD-WORKING

59:40 CONSUMER TODAY, YOUR BASKET OF GROCERIES IS 20% MORE THAN YOU

59:45 THINK IT SHOULD BE AND WHAT IT WAS WORTH TWO YEARS AGO.

59:48 THE COMPOUND EFFECT OF INFLATION IS WHAT IS AFFECTING

59:51 PEOPLE'S MENTALITY. THE SECOND PART IS PEOPLE ARE

59:56 WORKING HARDER, WORKING MORE DRUGS TO BUY WHAT THEY WANT TO

59:57 BUY. THE SAVINGS FROM THE PANDEMIC

01:00:00 IS GONE.

01:00:07 IF YOU LOOK AT THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF MANY AMERICANS WHO

01:00:12 WENT FROM HIGH CONSUMER DEBT TO THE PANDEMIC AND THEN WENT FROM

01:00:14 CONSUMER DEBT THEY WIPED OUT AND HIGH SAVINGS BECAUSE THEY

01:00:17 WERE FORCED IN, THEY SPENT ALL OF THAT MONEY.

01:00:20 THEY ARE BACK TO WHERE THEY STARTED.

01:00:23 TO CARE A LOT ABOUT INFLATION AND THEIR PURCHASING POWER.

01:00:27 WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WAGES TODAY EXCEEDING INFLATION.

01:00:31 THAT IS IN SPOT MARKET BASIS. WE HAVE NOT TALKED ABOUT IT

01:00:34 OVER A ONE EURO TWO YEAR BASIS. LISA:

01:00:37 I WONDER HOW MESSY DID IT IS. IF YOU WERE THE HEAD OF THE

01:00:42 ECONOMIC COUNCIL, HOW WOULD YOU COMMUNICATE THE IDEA THAT WE

01:00:47 ARE SEEING MASSIVE CHURN IN RESPONSE TO TECHNOLOGICAL

01:00:52 ADVANCES? EBAY LANG UP ITS STAFF BECAUSE

01:00:56 IT NEEDS TO UPDATE RCEP IN GERMANY.

01:00:59 HOW MUCH IS THAT FEATURING INTO THE MESSINESS OF THE DATA? GARY:

01:01:03 WE ALWAYS HAVE MESSY DATA. WE NEVER GET TOTALLY CLEAN DATA.

01:01:09 WE CAN TALK ALL ABOUT ALL OF THE REVISIONS TO THE

01:01:11 UNEMPLOYMENT DATA. THEY GO AND REVISE THE DATA AND

01:01:16 SOMETIMES THE REVISIONS ARE BIGGER THAN THE ACTUAL DATA.

01:01:21 THAT WE FIX IT ON THE DATA ON THAT FRIDAY AND A MONTH LATER

01:01:25 WE SAY THAT IT WAS COMPLETELY WRONG .

01:01:30 IF YOU WERE LOOKING FOR THE CLEAN ANSWER -- IF YOU ARE

01:01:34 LOOKING FOR THE CLEAN ANSWER, OUR DATA DOES NOT GIVE US A

01:01:35 CLEAN ANSWER. IT GETS VERY CLEAN OVER TIME.

01:01:41 YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE DATA OVER A LONGER PERIOD TREND.

01:01:45 I LOOK AT VISUAL SUPPORT, I THINK JOEL'S IS INTERESTING

01:01:50 BECAUSE IT SHOWS JOB IN BIDDINGS -- JOB OPENINGS.

01:01:56 THERE ARE INTERESTING NUMBERS IN THERE, IT SHOWS HOW THE

01:01:57 PEOPLE QUIT THEIR JOBS. PEOPLE ONLY QUIT THEIR JOB WHEN

01:02:02 HE FEEL LIKE THERE IS A BETTER JOB OUT THERE.

01:02:06 IT IS A MEASURE OF WHAT PEOPLE'S PSYCHOLOGY ON THE

01:02:07 MARKET IS. WHEN THE RATE GOES UP, IT MEANS

01:02:13 I BELIEVE I CAN GET A BETTER JOB, BETTER PAYING, BETTER

01:02:14 QUALITY OF LIFE. WHEN THE QUIT RATE GOES DOWN,

01:02:17 PEOPLE SAY THE JOB MARKET IS NOT VERY GOOD.

01:02:21 I DON'T LOVE IT BUT I SHOULD BE HAPPY WITH THE JOB I HAVE.

01:02:25 IF YOU PUT IT ALTOGETHER, YOU CAN CREATE A CLEAN PICTURE.

01:02:27 JONATHAN:

01:02:33 ON LIKE THIS -- UNLIKE THIS ADMINISTRATION, GARY WILL EXIT

01:02:34 COMMUNICATE. THAT TO GET YOU ANY UPDATE ON

01:02:37 THE STORIES. HERE IS YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF.

01:02:44 YAHAIRA: DONALD TRUMP IS MARCHING

01:02:45 TOWARDS A REMATCH WITH JOE BIDEN.

01:02:48 AFTER THE FORMER PRESIDENT COPLEY WON THE PRIMARY, TRUMP

01:02:52 BEAT HIS ONLY REMAINING CHALLENGER IN THE RACE, NIKKI

01:02:55 HALEY, WITH THE FORMER HUMAN INVESTOR REFUSING TO BACK OUT

01:02:56 OF THE RACE. NEVER EXISTS URGING AFTER

01:03:02 POSTING ITS BIGGEST SUBSCRIBER GAIN SINCE EARLY IN THE

01:03:03 PANDEMIC. STREAMING SERVICE'S DECISION TO

01:03:11 CRACKDOWN ON PASSWORD SHARING PAYING OFF WITH MORE THAN 13

01:03:13 MILLION CUSTOMERS SIGNING UP IN THE LAST QUARTER.

01:03:18 TESLA TELLING SUPPLIERS IT WANTS TO START PRODUCTION OF A

01:03:22 NEW MASS-MARKET EV THROUGH NEXT YEAR.

01:03:28 TESLA'S CHEAPEST CAR STARTS AT $40,000.

01:03:30 THIS MODEL WOULD START WELL SHORT OF THAT.

01:03:34 THE COMPANY WILL REPORT EARNINGS WITH THE STOCK DOWN

01:03:37 MORE THAN 15% TO START THE YEAR. THAT IS YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF.

01:03:42 JONATHAN: EQUITIES ON THE S&P 500

01:03:44 POSITIVE BY 0.4%. UP NEXT, NIKKI HALEY EVAL AND

01:03:52 TO PRESS ON -- VOWING TO PRESS ON.

01:03:54 >> THIS RACE IS FAR FROM OVER. THERE ARE DOZENS OF STATES LEFT

01:03:57 TO GO. JONATHAN: YOU ARE WATCHING ABIGAIL:

01:04:01 -- YOU ARE WATCHING "WALL

01:04:19 JONATHAN: QUOTED A WINNING STREAK ON HIS

01:04:23 BE 500 ABOUT TO BECOME FIVE, UP 0.5% IS A BE.

01:04:30 YIELDS COMING IN LOWER, 4.1% ON U.S. 10 YEAR.

01:04:34 NIKKI HALEY VOWING TO PRESS ON DESPITE HER LOSS IN NEW

01:04:36 HAMPSHIRE.

01:04:40 >> THIS RACE IS FAR FROM OVER, THERE ARE DOZENS OF STATES LEFT

01:04:41 TO GO. THE NEXT ONE IS MY SWEET STATE

01:04:46 OF SOUTH CAROLINA. JONATHAN: DONALD TRUMP DEFEATING HIS ONLY

01:04:54 REMAINING RIVAL IN THE GOP RACE, HIS VICTORY PUTTING HIM

01:04:55 IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT.

01:05:02 NO REPUBLICAN HAS FELT SECURE AFTER LOSING THE TWO FIRST

01:05:06 STATES AND NOW HE IS LOOKING TO DELIVER A KNOCKOUT. ANNMARIE:

01:05:13 THE POLLS LOOKING ROUGH IN HER HOME STATE.

01:05:15 THE WALL STREET JOURNAL THINK SHE HAS AN OPENING TO TAKE ON

01:05:18 TRUMP TO PROPOSE A BORDER TAX. HIS CODDLING OF DICTATORS COME

01:05:24 HIS BILLIARD WAS DEFENSE, ADDING AS MUCH TO THE NATIONAL

01:05:26 DEBT AS MUCH AS PRESIDENT BIDEN. SHE IS TO GRAB A SPECIFIC CAUSE

01:05:32 OR TWO, PERHAPS A SCHOOL CHOICE OR PARENTAL RIGHTS AND MAKE

01:05:33 THEM HERS. CAN SHE DO IT? THERE IS A HUGE MACHINE BEHIND

01:05:38 THE FORMER PRESIDENT. JONATHAN: LET'S GET TO KAILEY LEINZ.

01:05:46 NIKKI HALEY, THAT SHE MAKE IT TO SOUTH CAROLINA BASED ON WHAT

01:05:49 WE SAW LAST NIGHT? KAILEY: SHE SAYS SHE WILL.

01:05:58 SHE ENTER POWERFUL SURROGATES LIKE SUNUNU SAY ALL SHE NEEDS

01:06:00 IS A POWERFUL SECOND-PLACE. THEY DID NOT DEFINE WHAT THAT

01:06:04 IS. IT NOT NECESSARILY A STRONG SHOWING.

01:06:09 SHE STILL ABOUT TO CONTINUE ON. FEBRUARY 24 IS THAT PRIMARY.

01:06:16 THE DIFFICULTY SHE IS GOING TO HAVE IS IF SHE DID NOT PERFORM

01:06:19 THAT WELL AND IN NEW HAMPSHIRE WITH A LARGE BASE OF MODERATE

01:06:21 REPUBLICANS, IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW SHE COULD PERFORM

01:06:26 BETTER IN A FUTURE CONTEST WHERE THE BASE IS SIGNIFICANTLY

01:06:27 MORE CONSERVATIVE.

01:06:33 THE MAGA BASE IS STRONG THERE AT THAT COULD BE WEAPONIZED

01:06:35 AGAINST HER MOVING FORWARD. THAT IS WHY MANY PEOPLE ARE

01:06:39 SAYING THE GENERAL ELECTION HAS BEGUN.

01:06:43 WHAT WE ARE HEADING TOWARD IS A REMATCH BETWEEN TRUMP AND

01:06:46 PRESIDENT BIDEN, A DEVELOPMENT THAT THE BITE CAMPAIGN IS

01:06:50 WELCOMING AS THEY BELIEVE HE COULD BE TROUBLE ONCE AGAIN AS

01:06:53 HE DID IN 2020, A DEVELOPMENT MANY AMERICANS DO NOT WANT.

01:06:57 70% WOULD NOT LIKE EITHER MEANT TO BE PRESIDENT’'S SECOND TIME.

01:07:01 IT LOOKS LIKE THAT IS WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET. ANNMARIE:

01:07:06 THIS IS GOING TO PAINT SO MANY OF THE POLITICAL STORIES,

01:07:08 ESPECIALLY WHAT IS HAPPENING IN WASHINGTON, D.C.

01:07:11 IF TRUMP IS ALMOST CORRELATED AS THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION,

01:07:14 WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR A BORDER DEAL?

01:07:18 THAT WOULD GIVE A HUGE WIN TO PRESIDENT BIDEN AHEAD OF THE

01:07:19 ELECTION. KAILEY: THAT IS RIGHT. BIDEN IS NEGOTIATING WITH

01:07:28 SENATE LEADERS TO GET A BORDER DEAL DONE.

01:07:31 TO QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT THAT CAN PASS IN THE HOUSE,

01:07:35 SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON HAS A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH DONALD

01:07:39 TRUMP, AS DOES A VAST MAJORITY OF REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP.

01:07:44 ALL HAVE LINED UP TO IT WAS THE FORMER PRESIDENT AND TRUMP HAS

01:07:45 SAID THEY SHOWN EXCEPT A PERFECT BORDER DEAL.

01:07:50 CAN HE BE POLITICALLY ADVANTAGEOUS TO HIS OPPONENT,

01:07:53 JOE BIDEN? THIS LIKELY GENERAL ELECTION

01:07:59 REMATCH BETWEEN TWO INDIVIDUALS, THE GROUP NO

01:08:01 LABELS HAS SAID THEY WOULD RUN A UNITY TICKET IF BY SUPER

01:08:04 TUESDAY IT LOOKED LIKE WHAT IT WAS GOING TO BE WAS A TRUMP-BY

01:08:06 HIM RACE.

01:08:18 -- TRUMP-BIDED RACE -- TRUMP-BIDEN, SOMEONE LIKE HOGAN

01:08:23 OR A THIRD PARTY TO COME IN. JONATHAN:

01:08:28 IT ALREADY FEELS LIKE A YEAR LONG AL.

01:08:37 GARY COHN, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT POLICY.

01:08:40 LET'S TALK ABOUT TAX CUTS. I HAVE NOT TALKED ABOUT THE TAX

01:08:44 CUTS AT ALL OF THE MONEY STARTED TO COME BACK INTO THE

01:08:46 COUNTRY FOR THE BEST PART OF SIX YEARS.

01:08:50 HOW RELEVANT ARE YESTERDAY'S TAX CUTS. GARY:

01:08:55 THEY ARE THE 2017 TAX CUTS AND I THINK THEY ARE IMPORTANT.

01:08:58 THIS IS BACK ON THE THEME OF NORMALIZATION.

01:09:01 SINCE WE GOT THE TAX BECAUSE THROUGH THAT WERE SIGNED 2017,

01:09:07 WE HAD TWO NORMALIZED YEARS. 2018 WAS AN IMPLEMENTATION YEAR.

01:09:13 WE SAW SOME AMAZING THINGS HAPPEN.

01:09:21 WE SAW THREE -- REPATRIATION OF FOREIGN MONEY, SO MONEY CAME

01:09:22 BACK INTO THE U.S. IN THE OLD SYSTEM, COMPANIES

01:09:27 LETTER THEIR MONEY OFFSHORE. THEY BROUGHT IT BACK.

01:09:32 WE DEEMED THAT MONEY TO BE BROUGHT BACK SO WE TAXED IT.

01:09:37 WHAT YOU SEE AS THE MANUFACTURING BOOM IN THE U.S.

01:09:40 WHICH STARTED IN THAT PERIOD, A LOT HAS TO DO WITH THIS

01:09:42 REPATRIATED MONEY. WHEN COMPANIES CANNOT BRING

01:09:46 MONEY BACK, THEY HAD TO OVERSEAS, THEY BUILT

01:09:50 MANUFACTURING, THEN VESTED IN PROPERTY PLANT EQUIPMENT.

01:09:53 THEY ARE BRINGING IT BACK, BEING THE TEXT -- PAYING THE

01:09:58 TAX, AND INVESTING. THIS STARTED IN 2018 AS COMPANY

01:10:05 STARTED BRINGING BACK THEIR REPATRIATED MONEY.

01:10:08 YOU'RE ALSO SEEING THE GROWTH WE HAVE SEEN IN CONSUMPTION,

01:10:12 THE GROWTH IN THE MIDDLE CLASS'S ABILITY TO PAY MONEY.

01:10:16 HARD-WORKING INDIVIDUALS GOT THEIR TAX CUT AND I THINK THAT

01:10:19 IS WHY PEOPLE HAVE MISSED THE ECONOMIC PATRONAGE U.S..

01:10:23 EVERYONE CALLING FOR THIS RECESSION OVER THE LAST YEAR

01:10:24 AND A HALF. I DON'T THINK THEY UNDERSTOOD

01:10:28 THE ADDITIONAL CONSUMPTIVE POWERS THE TAX CUTS CREATED.

01:10:34 WE PUT REAL ADDITIONAL POSSIBLE -- DISPOSABLE INCOME INTO

01:10:36 PEOPLE'S POCKETS. WE MADE CARTRIDGES DECISIONS TO

01:10:42 MAKE SURE WE WERE DELIVERING REAL TAXABLE RETURNS, OR LESS

01:10:46 TAX TO THE HARDEST WORKING INDIVIDUALS IN AMERICA.

01:10:50 IT TAKES TIME FOR THAT TO FEET TO THE SYSTEM.

01:10:53 AND THEN WE GO TO COVID. WE GET ALL OF THESE UNNATURAL

01:10:56 PHENOMENONS. NOW WE ARE BACK TO NORMAL

01:10:59 BEHAVIOR. PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR

01:11:03 TAXABLE INCOME IS. SOME OF THE PROGRAMS WE PUT IN

01:11:11 2017 HAVE EXPIRED AND PIERCING BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION TO

01:11:13 REINSTATE SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS. THERE IS A BILL GOING

01:11:18 TO THE HOUSE TO REINSTATE CHILD TAX CREDITS ALONG WITH

01:11:20 ACCELERATED APPRECIATION. WE THINK BOTH SIDES OF THAT

01:11:26 EQUATION WERE IN THE ORIGINAL TAX BILL, WE THINK THEY'RE BOTH

01:11:27 IMPORTANT. YOU ARE TAKING CARE OF BOTH

01:11:29 SIDES OF THE EQUATION. HE HAD TO TAKE CARE OF

01:11:34 HARD-WORKING FAMILIES AND WITH THE DEVICE HIM IS TO DO R&D AND

01:11:36 CONTINUE TO INVEST IN THE COUNTRY. ANNMARIE:

01:11:40 DOES INDIVIDUAL TAX CUTS FROM 2017 ARE SAID TO BE EXPIRED.

01:11:45 THAT HELPS INDIVIDUALS BUT IF YOU HAVE A 10% TARIFF WALL

01:11:48 AROUND THE U.S., THAT IS A MASSIVE TAX ON CONSUMERS. GARY:

01:11:53 IT IS.

01:11:54 THE TARIFF WALL IS SOMETHING TO BE DISCUSSED, THERE IS A

01:11:59 POTENTIAL OF IT BEING DISCUSSED. IT IS AN IDEA, SOMETHING TO BE

01:12:05 USED TO PAY FOR THE FUTURE TAX PLANS. ANNMARIE:

01:12:07 WOULD IT NEGATE IT? GARY: WE SHOULD NOT GET TOO FAR AHEAD

01:12:11 OF OURSELVES RIGHT NOW. THE PERSONAL SIDE OF THE TAX

01:12:16 REFORM PACKAGE TERMINATES IN 2025. THERE WILL BE AN ENORMOUS

01:12:22 AMOUNT OF DISCUSSION BETWEEN NOW AND 2025.

01:12:25 IT WILL DEPEND ON WHAT THE MAKEUP OF CONGRESS LOOKS LIKE

01:12:30 FOR WHAT YOU ARE ABLE TO DO, WHAT YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO DO.

01:12:33 ARE YOU GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS TO RECONCILIATION?

01:12:35 THROUGH NORMAL ORDER? THROUGH SIMPLE MAJORITY?

01:12:42 THE REPUBLICANS WOULD HAVE TO SIT -- AFTER CONTROLLING HOUSE,

01:12:49 THE SENATE, AND THE WHITE HOUSE . YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE

01:12:53 MUCH MORE THE COMPROMISE OF WHAT GOES ON HERE -- MUCH MORE

01:12:58 OF A COMPROMISE OF WHAT GOES ON HERE.

01:13:01 THE IDEAS BEING TALKED ABOUT WRITING OUR CONCEPTS.

01:13:04 THIS IS WHAT IS INTERESTING.

01:13:10 IS A TIME WHEN POTENTIAL CANDIDATES AND INCUMBENTS --

01:13:13 THIS IS A TIME WHEN POTENTIAL CANDIDATES AND INCUMBENTS GET

01:13:16 TO TELL US THEIR IDEAS ABOUT HOW THEY WANT TO RUN THE

01:13:17 GOVERNMENT. THESE ARE IDEAS. THAT OUR CONCEPTS AS STARTING

01:13:26 PLACES, THEY ARE NOT NECESSARILY -- THERE ARE

01:13:28 CONCEPTS AS A STARTING PLACES, THEY ARE NOT NECESSARILY ENDING

01:13:30 PLACES. LISA: PEOPLE SAY IF TRUMP SAYS

01:13:32 SOMETHING WE ARE TAKING IT SERIOUSLY.

01:13:35 GARY COHN IS SAYING MAYBE NOT. UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE OUT OF

01:13:39 TIME BUT WE WILL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT. JONATHAN:

01:13:44 COMING UP NEXT, NETFLIX SHARES SURGING IN THE PREMARKET AFTER

01:13:59 JONATHAN: STOCKS ARE POSITIVE BY ZERO .4%

01:14:02 ON THE S&P 500. ON THE NASDAQ 100, ALL-TIME

01:14:06 HIGHS.

01:14:12 UP BY ANOTHER 0.7% HELD BY NETFLIX EARNINGS LOOKING GOOD.

01:14:15 THE TWO I, 30-YEAR. BELIEVE IT OR NOT, A WEEK AWAY

01:14:19 FROM ANOTHER FIT DECISION. LISA: IT'S A MATTER OF HOW MUCH THEY

01:14:26 PUSH BACK AGAINST SOME OF THE ENTHUSIASM WE SEE IN RISK

01:14:30 ASSETS GIVEN WE SEE A 50% CHANCE OF A MARCH RATE CUT

01:14:31 BEING PRICED INTO MARKETS. ONE KEY QUESTION WHERE YOU ARE

01:14:37 ALREADY SEEING IT PRICED IN, LED BY BIG TECH WHO IS

01:14:38 DELIVERING ON THE EARNINGS. JONATHAN:

01:14:42 HOW MUCH HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT EARNINGS REVISIONS?

01:14:46 THIS CONVERSATION STARTED YESTERDAY WITH J.P. MORGAN.

01:14:50 POLICY MAKERS WOULD DO WELL TO DEFER JUDGMENT ON INFLATION AND

01:14:54 THE TIMING OF THE FIRST RATE CUT UNTIL AFTER THE FEBRUARY

01:14:55 CPI REVISIONS. THAT IS THE FOCUS OF A LOT OF

01:14:58 PEOPLE. LISA: PEOPLE THINK THE DATA WAS MESSY

01:15:04 BECAUSE OF THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR AND HOLIDAY COMPS.

01:15:08 THE LONGER THIS RATE CUTTING PARLOR GAME CONTINUES, THE

01:15:12 LONGER YOU'LL SEE LONG-TERM INFLATION EXPECTATIONS TAKE UP.

01:15:19 IF YOU LOOK AT THE FORWARD BREAKEVEN CONTRACTS, DOWN FROM

01:15:21 A RECENT LOW OF 2.4%. IT GIVES YOU A SENSE OF HOW

01:15:26 MUCH PEOPLE ARE GAMING OUT HIGHER INFLATION FOR LONGER.

01:15:29 JONATHAN: THE EURO OUT TO 1.09 AGAINST

01:15:31 THE DOLLAR. POSITIVE ON THE SESSION BY 0.3%.

01:15:38 DONALD TRUMP TAKING ANOTHER STEP TOWARD A REMATCH WITH JOE

01:15:42 BIDEN, THE FORMER PRESIDENT WINNING THE NEW HAMPSHIRE

01:15:46 PRIMARY COMFORTABLY BEATING HIS ONLY REMAINING CHALLENGER IN

01:15:47 THE RACE, NIKKI HALEY. THE NEXT PRIMARY IS IN HER HOME

01:15:52 STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA NEXT MONTH.

01:15:55 AMH, THE POLLS DON'T LOOK GOOD. ANNMARIE:

01:16:00 ONE MEMBER OF CONGRESS AT THIS MOMENT, RALPH NORMAN, THE ONLY

01:16:03 MEMBER OF CONGRESS TO BACK HER AT THIS MOMENT.

01:16:06 YOU HAVE TIM SCOTT, THE GOVERNOR OF SOUTH CAROLINA ALL

01:16:09 GOING TO COALESCE BEHIND THE TRUMP. JONATHAN:

01:16:13 KIND OF SHOCKING THAT T TIM SCOTT BACKS THE FORMER

01:16:19 PRESIDENT. ANNMARIE: HE WAS JUST BEHIND THE FORMER

01:16:24 PRESIDENT AS HE DROPPED OUT, AND YOU ARE RIGHT, NIKKI HALEY

01:16:26 APPOINTED HIM. LISA: EVERYONE COALESCING BEHIND

01:16:32 DONALD TRUMP, I WONDER WHAT THIS MEANS FOR PASSING ANY KIND

01:16:34 OF BUDGET DEAL, BORDER DEAL.

01:16:41 ANYTHING THAT GIVES BIDEN A WIN IS NOT SOMETHING THAT THEY WANT.

01:16:46 JONATHAN: THE GROUP ATTACKED AN AIRBASE

01:16:47 HOUSING AMERICAN TROOPS. DEFENSE SECRETARY LLOYD AUSTIN

01:16:53 SAID IT CAME IN RESPONSE TO A SERIES OF ESCALATORY ATTACKS

01:16:55 AGAINST U.S. PERSONNEL IN IRAQ AND SYRIA.

01:16:58 THE U.S. ALSO ATTACKING TWO ANTISHIP

01:17:02 MISSILES IN THE RED SEA. THESE STORIES ARE CONNECTED.

01:17:08 THE ELECTION RACE AND WHAT IS DEVELOPING IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

01:17:11 ANNMARIE: FOREIGN POLICY BECOMING MORE

01:17:12 IMPORTANT. WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T

01:17:16 WANT TO DO IS SEE THIS CONFLICT EXPAND IN THE MIDDLE EAST. WHAT

01:17:23 THEY ARE DOING IS THIS LADDERED APPROACH, GOING AFTER THE

01:17:27 TRAINING FACILITIES, HOUSING OF THESE MISSILES, WEAPONRY THAT

01:17:29 THESE MALICIOUS CAN USE AGAINST THESE SHIPS. LISA:

01:17:32 WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ESCALATION.

01:17:38 IS THIS, FOR ALL INTENT AND PURPOSES, A LOW-GRADE WAR THAT

01:17:41 IS A HOT WAR BETWEEN THE U.S. AND IRANIAN PROXIES?

01:17:44 THE QUESTION IS WHAT THIS WILL DO TO IRAQ, WHETHER THEY WILL

01:17:48 ASKED TO PULL OUT SOME OF THE U.S.

01:17:49 TROOPS THAT HAVE BEEN THERE. IT REALLY DOES FEED INTO THE

01:17:51 ELECTION. JONATHAN:

01:17:52 ESSENTIALLY TWO PROXY WARS, ONE WITH RUSSIA, THE OTHER WITH

01:17:58 IRAN. ANNMARIE: WHAT YOU WANT TO SEE FROM THE

01:18:04 TRUMP CAMPAIGN, THEY DECIDED TO GO FOR A BIG STRIKE TARGET WHEN

01:18:06 IT CAME TO GOING AFTER RON. -- AFTER IRAN.

01:18:15 THROUGH REPORTING, INTERMEDIARIES WOULD GO TO THE

01:18:17 U.S., AFTER HE WAS TAKEN OUT. WE ARE DONE, WE DON'T WANT THIS

01:18:21 BLOODSHED IN THE REGION. JONATHAN:

01:18:25 ASML SEEING ORDERS FOR SEMICONDUCTORS TRIPLE IN THE

01:18:32 LAST QUARTER.

01:18:34 THE CEO TELLING BLOOMBERG, THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY HAS NOW

01:18:35 BOTTOMED.

01:18:38 >> WE SEE SIGNS OF RECOVERY. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR,

01:18:44 WE WOULD RATHER BE CONSERVATIVE, BUT AS YOU ALSO

01:18:50 SAW, RECORD QUARTERLY INTAKE WHICH BODES WELL FOR 2025 AND

01:18:51 PERHAPS THE BACKEND.

01:18:52 >> TO BE CLEAR, THIS SEMICONDUCTOR MARKET HAS NOW

01:18:56 BOTTOMED?

01:18:57 >> THAT IS WHAT WE BELIEVE. JONATHAN:

01:19:00 IT IS THE LATEST SIGN OF A RESURGENCE IN THE INDUSTRY.

01:19:05 TSMC PROJECTING STRONG REVENUE GROWTH IN 2024.

01:19:10 I HAVE TO CLARIFY, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A COMPANY THAT

01:19:12 MAKES THE MOST SOPHISTICATED CHIPS ON THE PLANET.

01:19:15 HUGE DEMAND OUT OF CHINA FOR GOOD REASON.

01:19:19 I WONDER WHAT THAT DEMAND WILL LOOK LIKE, THEIR ABILITY TO

01:19:21 SUPPLY IT IN THE YEARS TO COME. LISA:

01:19:26 ESPECIALLY IF THESE SENTIENT GO INTO PLAY, IF THEY ARE

01:19:28 FRONTLOADING SOME OF THAT INCREASING GEOPOLITICAL RISK.

01:19:33 WE HEARD FROM QUALCOMM AS WELL, AS WELL AS OTHER EXECUTIVES

01:19:36 SAYING THIS WILL ONLY INCREASE THE RACE IN CHINA TO DEVELOP

01:19:39 THEIR OWN SHIP, HAMPER THEIR ABILITY TO COMPETE. ANNMARIE:

01:19:46 ASML SEEMS TO BE BENEFITING FROM THIS RACE TO HOARD A LOT

01:19:49 OF THIS TECHNOLOGY BEFORE THESE PENALTIES COME ONLINE.

01:19:55 BUT AT WHAT POINT DOES THAT BECOME BENEFICIAL, OR HOW MUCH

01:19:57 DOES AI ACTUALLY OUTWEIGH IT? YOU NEED THE TECHNOLOGY TO

01:20:00 BUILD OUT AI. JONATHAN:

01:20:02 NETFLIX ABSOLUTELY SOARING IN THE PREMARKET, FOLLOWING A

01:20:07 BLOCKBUSTER EARNINGS REPORT. WINNING MORE THAN 13 MILLION

01:20:12 NEW CUSTOMERS IN THE LAST QUARTER, THE BEST GAIN SINCE

01:20:15 THE START OF THE PANDEMIC. IT COMES AS THE COMPANY

01:20:23 INTRODUCES A CHEAPER AD SUPPORTED SERVICE.

01:20:27 >> OUR ENGAGEMENT IS A BIT IMPACTED BY OUR PAGE SHARING.

01:20:32 THINK ABOUT IT LIKE FEWER HOUSEHOLDS USING THE SAME

01:20:33 ACCOUNT. AS THOSE FOLKS GET THEIR OWN

01:20:38 ACCOUNTS, AND WE WIN THEM OVER WITH OUR PROGRAM, THAT WILL

01:20:41 NORMALIZE AND CONTINUE TO GROW. JONATHAN:

01:20:49 MATTHEW DAVIDSON -- MICHAEL NATHANSON JOINS US NOW.

01:20:51 LOCK ME THROUGH WHERE THE REVENUE GROWTH COMES FROM THAT.

01:20:55 IS IT HIGHER SUBS OR PRICES? MICHAEL: PROBABLY A MIX OF BOTH.

01:21:02 THEY HAVE A LOT OF ROOM TO GROW IN DEVELOPING MARKETS, LATIN

01:21:06 AMERICA, U.K., ASIA-PACIFIC. ON THE REVENUE SIDE, THEY ARE

01:21:14 STILL INFUSING THIS ADVERTISING TIER, ROLLING THAT OUT AT A

01:21:22 LOWER PRICE.

01:21:24 THEY HAVE A STEADY MIX OF GOING FORWARD VOLUME AND PRICE.

01:21:29 PROBABLY LOOKING AT AN 8% TO 10% TOPLINE GROWTH OVER THE

01:21:30 NEXT FEW YEARS BECAUSE OF THAT. LISA:

01:21:33 DO YOU EXPECT CONSOLIDATION THAT THAT FLOCKS -- NETFLIX IS

01:21:36 INVOLVED IN? JUST HOW MUCH THERE WILL HAVE

01:21:42 TO BE THIS KIND OF TIE UP CYCLE WITHIN MEDIA? MICHAEL:

01:21:50 NETFLIX WPM ON'T PARTICIPATE IN THAT TIE UP CYCLE.

01:21:53 THEIR COMPETITORS HAVE NEVER BEEN WEAKER.

01:21:58 THE PEOPLE THAT OWN CABLE NETWORKS, WARNER BROS.,

01:22:00 DISCOVERY, PARAMOUNTS HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

01:22:05 COMCAST HAS PEACOCK.

01:22:12 PEACOCK IS STILL NOT FULLY SCALED, SO THERE HAS TO BE SOME

01:22:13 KIND OF STREAMING CONSOLIDATION AND RADIO NETWORK CONSOLIDATION.

01:22:16 I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT GETS DONE IN THE NEAR TERM, BUT NETFLIX

01:22:19 WILL NOT BE A PART OF THAT. LISA:

01:22:25 HOW MUCH IS NETFLIX INDEPENDENT AND BEING ABLE TO CRACKDOWN ON

01:22:28 PASSWORD SHARING VERSUS A SHINING LIGHT FOR THE INDUSTRY

01:22:37 TO CRACKDOWN HBO, ON ALL OF THE EYEBALLS NOT PAYING THE BILLS?

01:22:41 MICHAEL: NETFLIX HAS BEEN THE FIRST DOWN

01:22:42 THIS PATH.

01:22:49 THEY HIT MATURITY THE FIRST. THEY ALSO DIDN'T CARE ABOUT

01:22:50 PASSWORD SHARING IN THE BEGINNING.

01:22:55 THE OTHERS DON'T HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE THEY DON'T

01:22:57 HAVE AS MUCH VOLUME AND PROGRAMMING.

01:22:59 NETFLIX HAS QUALIFIED ABOUT 100 MILLION HOMES ARE PASSWORD

01:23:03 SHARERS. THEY HAVE NOT TOLD US HOW MANY

01:23:07 OF THOSE HAVE BEEN CONVERTED. AT THIS POINT THEY PROBABLY

01:23:11 DON'T KNOW BECAUSE IT'S BEEN MIXED TOGETHER.

01:23:15 I WOULD THINK THE OTHERS AT THE SAME OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE THEY

01:23:17 ARE STILL GROWING THE BUSINESS AND DON'T HAVE THE VOLUME YET.

01:23:21 IT'S A CHALLENGE FOR EVERYONE TO PLAY THE SAME GAME.

01:23:26 THEY ARE ON A DIFFERENT PLANE IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY'RE ABLE

01:23:27 TO DO. JONATHAN: WE WERE TALKING ABOUT

01:23:31 CONSOLIDATION IN THE INDUSTRY. WHERE DO YOU SEE CONSOLIDATION

01:23:37 COMING FROM, AND WHO BETWEEN? MICHAEL:

01:23:42 IT HAS TO BE SOME COMBINATION OF WARNER, PARAMOUNT, NBC

01:23:43 UNIVERSAL. DISNEY ISN'T GOING TO DO ANY

01:23:46 MORE DEALS. NETFLIX IS FINE. I DON'T THINK AMAZON AND APPLE

01:23:52 ARE GOING TO BUY OTHER ASSETS. TO ME, THE LEGACY MEDIA

01:23:58 COMPANIES HAVE TO FIND COST SYNERGIES, GET STREAMING SCALE.

01:24:03 IT HAS TO BE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WOUNDED NOW BY CORD CUTTING

01:24:06 COME OF NETFLIX.

01:24:14 BECAUSE OF PERSONALITIES OR REGULATORY PRESSURES OR JUST

01:24:18 THE UNWILLINGNESS TO COME TOGETHER, I DON'T THINK IT WILL

01:24:23 NECESSARILY HAPPEN THIS YEAR.

01:24:25 TO ME, THIS WILL BE MORE OF THE SAME FOR 2024. JONATHAN:

01:24:29 ARE YOU SAYING THE EGOS OF SOME OF THESE COMPANIES ARE SO LARGE

01:24:32 THEY WILL NOT CONSOLIDATE UNTIL THEY ARE FORCED TO?

01:24:35 SO ULTIMATELY YOU MAY NEED TO SEE PAIN FIRST? MICHAEL:

01:24:40 THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT SO MUCH MORE ARTFULLY THAN I DID.

01:24:43 YOU HAVE TO RECOGNIZE YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.

01:24:47 SOME OF IT WILL HAVE TO GO TO ONE OF THEIR COMPETITORS, THEIR

01:24:52 KNEES, SAYING LET'S FIND A WAY TO WORK TOGETHER.

01:24:55 I DON'T THINK THE PEOPLE THAT RUN THESE COMPANIES WANT TO DO

01:24:56 THAT YET. JONATHAN: WHAT IS THE TOPIC?

01:25:02 -- TOP PICK? MICHAEL: OUR FAVORITE STOCK IDEA IS

01:25:07 SHORTING ROKU. WE HAVE A SHORT CALL ON ROKU

01:25:15 BECAUSE WE THINK LESS COMPETITION IN STREAMING IS NOT

01:25:16 GOOD FOR THEM. WE ALSO HAVE A BUY ON DISNEY

01:25:23 WITH THE IDEA THAT DISNEY HAS TO ARTICULATE A PROFIT STORY IN

01:25:25 STREAMING IN 2024. THEY HAVE BEEN VAGUE ABOUT

01:25:28 THEIR LONG-TERM PROFITABILITY. DISNEY WILL BE MAYBE BREAKEVEN

01:25:33 BY THE END OF THE FALL QUARTER.

01:25:39 IT IS REALLY ABOUT THEIR ARTICULATION OF PROFITABILITY.

01:25:42 HOPEFULLY IN THE FIRST HALF OF THIS YEAR WE GET MORE

01:25:45 INFORMATION ON WHERE WE SEE THAT THIS IS HEADING TOWARD.

01:25:49 JONATHAN: MICHAEL NATHANSON, ALWAYS NICE

01:25:50 TO HEAR FROM YOU.

01:25:57 LISA: IT IS A SHORT BET, THAT IS ALL

01:25:58 YOU CAN SAY. HE LAUGHED AND SAID WE ARE

01:26:04 ACTUALLY SHORTING ROKU BECAUSE IT WILL PROBABLY LOSE, AND THEN

01:26:08 A REALLY UNENTHUSIASTIC EXCLAMATION OF DISNEY. JONATHAN:

01:26:13 I WILL NOT SAY WHO HAS THE BIGGEST EGO IN THAT SPACE BUT

01:26:17 THAT IS ULTIMATELY NEVER GOOD, THAT THINGS HAVE TO GET WORSE

01:26:18 BEFORE THEY GET BETTER FOR LEADERSHIP TO CONCEDE SOMETHING

01:26:20 NEEDS TO BE DONE. LISA: BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO AGREE TO A

01:26:24 PRICE THEY DON'T LIKE. THAT IS THE REASON WHY PEOPLE

01:26:28 HAVE BEEN SURPRISED BY HOW SLOW THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN THAT

01:26:30 EVERYONE HAS A SPECTER FOR QUITE A WHILE. JONATHAN:

01:26:34 THAT STOCK IS UP BY SOMETHING LIKE 10%.

01:26:38 ELSEWHERE THIS MORNING, HERE IS YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF.

01:26:43 >> AT&T HAD DELIVERED A STRONG FOURTH QUARTER WITH ITS

01:26:45 WIRELESS AND BROADBAND BUSINESSES, GROWING AT A FASTER

01:26:47 PACE FOR THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE QUARTER.

01:26:50 THE TELECOM PROVIDER HAVE BEEN IN A TOUGH STRETCH OF SLOW

01:26:51 GROWTH AND JOB CUTS.

01:26:57 CEO JOHN STINKY EMBARQ ON A RUTHLESS KOSKINEN CAMPAIGN THAT

01:27:01 INCLUDED OFFICE CLOSURES AND SLOWING INVESTMENT.

01:27:07 APPLE IS DIALING BACK ITS AUTO AMBITIONS AFTER A DECADE-LONG

01:27:08 EFFORT TO BUILD A CAR. BLOOMBERG HAS LEARNED THE FIRM

01:27:13 IS NOW LOOKING AT AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE WITH MORE LIMITED

01:27:16 FEATURES, PIVOTING FROM ITS PLANS TO MAKE THE VEHICLE

01:27:19 DRIVERLESS. THE TARGET RELEASE DATE FOR AN

01:27:22 APPLE HAS ALSO BEEN PUSHED BACK TO 2028 AT THE EARLIEST. TAKE

01:27:25 LAYOUTS CONTINUE. GERMAN SOFTWARE COMPANY SAP

01:27:31 PLANS FOR AN 8000-JOB RESTRUCTURING TO BUILD OUT AI,

01:27:34 WHILE EBAY WILL CUT 1000 JOBS. THAT IS 9% OF ITS FULL-TIME

01:27:37 WORKFORCE. IT IS THE SECOND ROUND OF

01:27:41 REDUCTIONS AT EBAY IN A YEAR. 60 OTHER TECH COMPANIES

01:27:47 INCLUDING AMAZON AND ALPHABET HAVE LET ALMOST 11,000

01:27:49 EMPLOYEES GO SO FAR THIS YEAR. THAT IS YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF.

01:27:54 JONATHAN: THANK YOU. NEXT ON THE PROGRAM, IT IS THE

01:27:58 YEAR OF THE LANDING.

01:28:02 >> THE MARKET IS PRICING IN A LOW CHANCE OF A HARD LANDING.

01:28:06 40% CHANCE OF A HARD LANDING I THINK IS STILL THERE. JONATHAN:

01:28:09 THAT IS NEXT ON THE PROGRAM. YOU ARE WATCHING "BLOOMBERG

01:28:11 SURVEILLANCE."

01:28:32 JONATHAN: THE GRIND TIRE CONTINUES ON THE

01:28:35 S&P 500, POSITIVE BY 0.4%. YIELDS ARE LOWER BY .4%.

01:28:46 EURO, 1.08 AGAINST THE DOLLAR. UNDER SURVEILLANCE THIS

01:28:50 MORNING, IT IS THE YEAR OF THE LANDING.

01:28:56 >> A THE MARKET IS PRICING A 40% CHANCE OF A HARD LANDING.

01:29:01 WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DETAILS OF THE DATA, IT IS NOT ALL THAT

01:29:06 ROBUST. THERE IS A CHANCE THINGS SLOW DOWN OR THE FED

01:29:10 DOESN'T CUT FAST ENOUGH OR THEY CONTINUE LONG ENOUGH AND THAT

01:29:12 IS THE CHANCE WHERE SOMETHING COULD GO WRONG. JONATHAN:

01:29:16 LISA ASKED FOR VERY SPECIFIC PERCENTAGES OF HARD LANDING,

01:29:20 SOFT LANDING. THE FED WAITING ANOTHER ROUND

01:29:23 OF READING ON THE ECONOMY WITH THE PCE DEFLATOR NEXT WEEK.

01:29:30 WHAT GETS THEM TO CUT IN MARCH IS THE INFLATION DATA.

01:29:34 EVEN IF YOU CAN'T BE SIDE OF THE ECONOMY IS DOING WELL, IT'S

01:29:36 THE DECELERATION IN INFLATION. AS WE ROLL INTO THE MARCH

01:29:41 MEETING, I THINK THEY GET GRADUALLY MORE CONFIDENT ABOUT

01:29:45 THE TRAJECTORY. LISA: YOU KNOW WHO AGREES WITH HIM,

01:29:50 JIM BULLARD, FORMER MEMBER OF THE FED.

01:29:54 HE EXPECTS THE FED TO LOWER RATES BEFORE WE GET TO THAT 2%

01:29:57 TARGET IN INFLATION AND THAT CUTS COULD COME AS SOON AS

01:30:00 MARCH. HE WROTE INFLATION ON A CORM ON

01:30:03 THE BASIS YOU COULD GET BY 2% BY THE THIRD QUARTER OF THE

01:30:05 YEAR. THIS IS TRICKY BECAUSE THE FED

01:30:07 DOESN'T WANT TO GET INTO THE SECOND HALF OF 2024 AND

01:30:12 INFLATION ALREADY AT 2% AND YOU STILL HAVEN'T MOVE THE POLICY.

01:30:13 THAT WOULD BE TOO LATE. SUDDENLY HE IS A DOVE AFTER

01:30:18 BEING A HAWK. JONATHAN: HIS WAS THE DOT AT THE VERY

01:30:23 BOTTOM. I LOVE HEARING ABOUT OFFICIALS

01:30:27 BECAUSE THEY ARE HONEST ABOUT HOW THEY FEEL AND NOT GUARDED.

01:30:31 LISA: YOU FEEL THEY ARE PAVING A PATH

01:30:34 FOR THE MARCH RATE CUT EVEN THOUGH SOME BELIEVE THAT WILL

01:30:35 RELEASE ANOTHER ROUND. JONATHAN: YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT

01:30:39 CHECKING OUT MARKET EXPECTATIONS.

01:30:43 YOU ARE NOT GOING TO MOVE MARKETS LIKE YOU USE TO. LISA:

01:30:47 NOT GOING TO HEAR ANYTHING FROM YOUR COLLEAGUES. JONATHAN:

01:30:52 KATHY JONES JOINS US NOW. MICHAEL KEATON SAYING RATE CUTS.

01:30:59 HE WAS SAYING RATE CUTS IN MARCH.

01:31:00 YOU THINK THAT'S TOO SOON? KATHY:

01:31:04 IT ISN'T WHAT I THINK THAT THAT OUGHT TO DO, IT IS WHAT I THINK

01:31:05 THE FED WILL DO. ALL THE COMMUNICATION KEEPS

01:31:09 PUSHING US BACK TO MAY BE MADE. WE HAVE PENCILED IN A MAY START

01:31:13 TO THE RATE CUTS.

01:31:15 ONE OF THE RATE CUTS -- THEY STILL NEED TO ADDRESS THE

01:31:20 BALANCE SHEET WHICH WE KNOW IS A TOPIC.

01:31:24 WE HEARD FROM LORI LOGAN ABOUT TAPERING QT.

01:31:26 THAT IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN AT THE MARCH MEETING.

01:31:31 WE HAVE THE EXPIRATION OF THE BANK TERM FUNDING PROGRAM

01:31:32 ALTHOUGH THAT CAN GO ANOTHER YEAR.

01:31:34 THERE ARE A FEW THINGS IN THE WAY.

01:31:37 THEY ALSO KNEW THAT LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE THAT INFLATION WILL

01:31:38 ACTUALLY STAY DOWN. THAT ALL PUSHES US MORE TOWARD

01:31:41 MAY THAN MARCH. LISA: YOU THINK THERE'S A HIGH CHANCE

01:31:46 THEY COULD DO IT IN MARCH EVEN THOUGH THEY SHOULDN'T

01:31:47 NECESSARILY DO IT ACCORDING TO YOU. WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE YOU?

01:31:53 ARE YOU LEANING INTO RISKIER CREDIT BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE

01:31:55 THE FED WILL DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO PRIORITIZE A SOFT

01:31:58 LANDING EVEN OVER PICKING SURE THE BEAST OF INFLATION IS

01:32:02 KILLED? KATHY: NO, WE ARE NOT LEANING INTO

01:32:05 CREDIT. WE ARE LEANING IN THE OTHER

01:32:09 DIRECTION BECAUSE OF VALUATION. YOU CANNOT TRADE ON VALUATION

01:32:15 ALL THE TIME BUT SPREADS ARE SO TIGHT YOU MAY AS WELL BE IN

01:32:18 TREASURIES AT THIS STAGE OF THE GAME WHEN IT COMES TO

01:32:19 INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT. EVEN HIGH YIELD, SPREADS ARE SO

01:32:24 LOW, YOU CAN EARN THE COUPON COME IN DECENT YEAR, BUT

01:32:28 DEFINITELY NOT LEANING IN AT THIS STAGE OF THE GAME. LISA:

01:32:31 WHERE ARE YOU LEANING IN IN TERMS OF TREASURIES?

01:32:35 DOES THIS GIVE YOU CONVICTION THAT WE WILL GET TO A 3.5%

01:32:37 10-YEAR WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS? KATHY:

01:32:43 NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS IS AGGRESSIVE BUT I THINK WE GET

01:32:45 BACK TOWARD A 3.5% FOR THE END OF THE YEAR.

01:32:50 WE THINK THE MAIN THING WILL BE BULL STEEPENING.

01:32:55 AS THE FED STARTS TO CUT, 7, 10 YAYA HANGING IN THERE.

01:32:59 WE ARE PRETTY CLOSE TO IT NOW. PROBABLY GET A RANGE AROUND

01:33:04 THAT LEVEL AROUND 4% FOR A WHILE.

01:33:07 WE THINK THE MAIN TREND WILL BE BULL STEEPENING. JONATHAN:

01:33:10 WHY IT IS STEEPENING IN MY WE ARE CUTTING IS IMPORTANT.

01:33:14 IS IT BECAUSE INFLATION IS COMING IN AND NOT BECAUSE

01:33:16 GROWTH IS NOT COLLAPSING? PRIYA MISRA YESTERDAY TURNING

01:33:23 POSITIVE ON CREDIT BECAUSE SHE THINKS THERE IS THIS WINDOW

01:33:25 RIGHT NOW TO BE CONSTRUCTED ON RISK ASSETS.

01:33:28 ULTIMATELY THE FED CAN CUT BECAUSE INFLATION IS COMING IN

01:33:31 AND WE HAVE NOT SEEN A COLLAPSE IN ECONOMIC GROWTH.

01:33:33 DO YOU SEE THAT WINDOW AS WELL? KATHY:

01:33:40 I THINK THE SCENARIO IS REALISTIC, JUST THAT THE

01:33:41 MARKETS WERE CREDIT HAVE PRICED IT IN. TO LEAN IN NOW IS TO GET

01:33:47 AGGRESSIVE MAYBE A LITTLE BIT LATER THAN YOU MIGHT WANT TO.

01:33:52 ALSO, LOOK AT DEFAULT RATES PICKING UP.

01:33:56 WE ARE NOT LOOKING AT UNDERLYING FUNDAMENTALS FOR

01:33:57 CREDIT GETTING BETTER. THE SPREADS ARE VERY TIGHT, SO

01:34:02 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO, JUST RELY ON THE FED TO CUT RATES?

01:34:05 THAT'S AN INTEREST RATE PLAY, NOT A CREDIT PLAY.

01:34:12 WHEN IT COMES TO CREDIT, I DON'T THINK THAT IS FULLY

01:34:13 PRICED IN. I THINK WE ARE PRICED IN FED

01:34:17 RATE CUTS AND RESCUING THE ECONOMY AND THE CREDIT CYCLE.

01:34:20 I THINK THE JURY IS STILL OUT ON THAT. LISA:

01:34:26 HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU ABOUT A TICK BACK UP IN INFLATION BASED

01:34:28 ON HOW THE MARKETS PRICE THINGS, BASED ON WHAT YOU THINK

01:34:30 THE FED WILL DO, NOT ON WHAT THEY SHOULD DO? KATHY:

01:34:35 MY FEELING IS INFLATION STILL COMES DOWN.

01:34:39 WE ARE IN THE CAMP THAT WE ARE IN THIS DECLINING INFLATION.

01:34:47 THERE IS JUST NOT A LOT OF EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST

01:34:48 THAT IS TAKING PLACE. I HAVE A VERY SOFT GLOBAL

01:34:52 ECONOMY, TOO. WE DO THINK INFLATION WILL COME

01:34:54 DOWN. THE CATALYST FOR THE FED

01:35:00 CUTTING RATES, YOU HAVE REAL RATES NOW HEADING TOWARD LEVELS

01:35:04 THAT ARE REALLY RESTRICTIVE. I THINK THAT THAT WILL BE THE

01:35:07 MOTIVATION. IF THEY GO IN MARCH, THAT WILL

01:35:10 PROBABLY BE THE REASON WHY. I JUST LEAN TOWARD MAY BECAUSE

01:35:14 OF THE MESSAGING WE ARE GETTING. LISA: TOMORROW WE GET THE ECB

01:35:20 MEETING, TALKING ABOUT THE U.S., HAS BEEN THE MAIN GAME IN

01:35:22 TOWN FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. ARE WE STARTING TO SWITCH GEARS?

01:35:27 WE SEE IN EUROPE, ITALIAN YIELDS COMING IN DRAMATICALLY,

01:35:30 INCREDIBLE RUSH TO RISK THERE. ARE YOU FOLLOWING THAT?

01:35:36 KATHY: I THINK THERE ARE SOME ATTRACTIVE PLACE IN EUROPE

01:35:39 BECAUSE OF THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE ECB HAS TO GO SOONER AND

01:35:44 FASTER THAN MAYBE THE U.S.. I THINK THERE IS A PLAY THERE.

01:35:50 WE ACTUALLY LEANED INTO EMERGING MARKETS, AS WELL,

01:35:53 BECAUSE RATE CUTTING CYCLE IN THE U.S. IS OFTEN GOOD FOR EM.

01:35:57 JONATHAN: LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT SELECTIVITY.

01:36:00 CHINA, A BIG CHUNK OF THAT PART OF THE WORLD, BASICALLY TRYING

01:36:05 TO STIMULATE DEMAND FOR ITS OWN EQUITIES BY APPARENTLY,

01:36:11 ACCORDING TO OUR REPORTING, CONSIDERING USING MONEY FROM

01:36:13 STATE OWNED ENTERPRISES OFFSHORE TO BUY INTO THE MARKET

01:36:14 THROUGH HONG KONG. THEY ARE CUTTING THE RRR RATE.

01:36:21 WHAT CAN I DO TO STIMULATE DEMAND IN THAT ECONOMY? KATHY:

01:36:26 I THINK THERE IS SOME FISCAL SPACE THERE.

01:36:32 THEY SEEM TO BE NOT USING THAT DIRECTLY, DOING IT INDIRECTLY

01:36:33 THROUGH THE BANKING SYSTEM. I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHY YOU

01:36:38 WOULD WANT TO WE'LL EVER THE STOCK MARKET RATHER THAN USE

01:36:40 FISCAL POLICY. BUT I WILL TELL YOU, FRANKLY, I

01:36:45 DON'T SPEND A LOT OF TIME WORRYING ABOUT CHINESE BONES.

01:36:48 JONATHAN: CAN YOU BE CONSTRUCTIVE EM

01:36:51 WITHOUT SPENDING MUCH TIME WORRYING ABOUT CHINA? KATHY:

01:36:56 IF CHINA TAKES ANY STEP TOWARD STABILIZING THEIR ECONOMY AND

01:37:02 REDUCING RATES, COUNTRIES SHOULD BENEFIT FROM THAT.

01:37:05 AIPAC, EM. WE ARE SEEING POSITIVE THINGS

01:37:08 HAPPEN IN MEXICO. THERE IS SOME ROOM FOR MOVEMENT.

01:37:14 JONATHAN: WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS A FEW

01:37:17 TIMES ALREADY THIS WEEK, ENGINES FOR GROWTH, THE U.S.

01:37:20 IS OK, EUROPE IS NOT GREAT, CHINA IS STRUGGLING.

01:37:23 THE GLOBAL ECONOMY IS A THREE LEGGED STOOL.

01:37:26 TWO OF THOSE BASES ARE NOT LOOKING GOOD. LISA:

01:37:30 INTERESTING THAT THE U.S. IS TRULY DIVERGING BECAUSE OF

01:37:33 THE TECH STORY AND ALSO BECAUSE MAYBE THERE ARE SMALLER ENGINES

01:37:36 THAT PEOPLE TALK ABOUT, WHETHER IT IS MEXICO, INDIA.

01:37:40 THE IDEA THAT CHINA IS MOVING AWAY FROM CENTER STAGE AS THEY

01:37:44 ISOLATE THEMSELVES HAS REALLY BEEN A NARRATIVE THE PAST 18

01:37:46 MONTHS. JONATHAN: GOOD TO SEE YOU, KATHY JONES,

01:37:51 PUSHING BACK AGAINST THE IDEA OF A RATE CUT IN MARCH.

01:37:55 MICHAEL GAPEN THINGS WE MAY WELL GET ONE IN A FEW MONTHS

01:37:56 TIME. IN THE NEXT HOUR, WE WILL HAVE

01:38:00 CONVERSATION WITH THE FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER KEVIN MCCARTHY,

01:38:05 DAVID RUBENSTEIN, ANDREW HOLLENHORST OF CITI, AND MANDY

01:38:10 XU OF CBOE. THAT WILL BE IN THE NEXT HOUR.

01:38:17 S&P 500, EQUITIES LOOK LIKE THIS. POSITIVE BY 0.4%.

01:38:24 YIELDS LOWER.

01:38:31 A WEEK AWAY FROM A FEDERAL RESERVE DECISION.

01:38:33 THE ECB IS COMING UP TOMORROW. A LOT OF PEOPLE BELIEVE THE ECB

01:38:37 WILL MOVE BEFORE THE FEDERAL RESERVE.

01:38:41 THE THIRD HOUR OF "BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE"

01:38:55 >> WE ARE IN A SOFT LANDING RIGHT NOW, LOOKING AT THE DATA.

01:38:58 THE DATA LOOK STRONG.

01:39:03 >> EVEN IF THE ACTIVITY SIDE OF THE ECONOMY IS DOING WELL, AS

01:39:06 IT IS, IT IS REALLY THE DECELERATION IN INFLATION.

01:39:09 >> IT IS NOT THAT EASY TO GET INFLATION DOWN THAT QUICKLY.

01:39:14 >> AS WE GET INTO THIS YEAR, I THINK STEPPING BACK, WE WILL

01:39:17 SEE WHAT KIND OF ECONOMY WE HAVE.

01:39:21 >> THIS IS "BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE"

01:39:26 WITH JONATHAN FERRO, LISA, AND ANNMARIE HORDERN. JONATHAN:

01:39:29 GOOD MORNING. THIS IS "BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE"

01:39:35 WITH LISA ABRAMOVITZ, AND ANNMARIE HORDERN.

01:39:39 THE S&P 500 POSITIVE AGAIN AFTER FOUR DAYS OF GAINS, THREE

01:39:42 CONSECUTIVE ALL-TIME HIGHS. THE DATA IN THE LAST WEEK HAS

01:39:44 BEEN GOOD. RETAIL SALES HOT.

01:39:46 CONSUMER CONFIDENCE PICKING UP. AND THEN RESTART THE EARNINGS

01:39:51 FOR TECH. NETFLIX KNOCKING IT OUT OF THE

01:39:53 PARK. LISA: THIS IS THE KICKER TO THE

01:40:00 HANDWRINGING OVER IF IT'S A PROBLEM, DOESN'T MAKE THE

01:40:03 MARKET MORE FRAGILE THAT THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN HAS DRIVEN SO

01:40:04 MUCH OF WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN U.S. MARKETS.

01:40:08 TURNS OUT THEY ARE MINTING CASH. THEY ADDED 13.1 MILLION NEW

01:40:13 SUBSCRIBERS, THE MOST SINCE THE HEART OF THE PANDEMIC, AND NOW

01:40:16 PEOPLE HAVE OPTIONS LIKE GOING OUTSIDE. YOU CAN SEE THE SHARES

01:40:19 BOUNCING. JONATHAN: IT ALWAYS FEELS PERSONAL WITH

01:40:21 YOU. THE STOCK IS UP 9.9%.

01:40:27 MORE EARNINGS LATER THIS AFTERNOON, SO THINGS ARE

01:40:28 LOOKING GOOD. CONSUMER CONFIDENCE PICKING UP,

01:40:33 THE DATA SEEMS TO BE OK, UNEMPLOYMENT BELOW 4%.

01:40:38 AMH, YOU WOULD THINK THIS IS GOOD NEWS FOR THE SITTING

01:40:41 PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE IT FEELS LIKE IT'LL BE

01:40:43 AROUND TWO AGAINST DONALD TRUMP. ANNMARIE:

01:40:46 GOOD NEWS ON THE ECONOMIC FRONT, THE TIMELINE IS ON THEIR

01:40:47 SIDE. INFLATION IS COMING DOWN. PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO

01:40:53 POTENTIALLY FEEL THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS THAT THE BIDEN

01:40:55 ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN TELLING THEM THEY SHOULD BE FEELING.

01:40:59 POLLS HAVE BEEN SHOWING THAT MAYBE WE ARE GOING INTO

01:41:02 NOVEMBER, PEOPLE ARE FEELING BETTER. THE CAMPAIGN PUTS OUT A

01:41:07 STATEMENT LAST NIGHT SAYING ALMOST EAGERLY WE ARE CITED TO

01:41:08 TAKE ON TRUMP. BIDEN WAS THE ONLY PERSON WHO

01:41:11 COULD BE TRUMP. TRUMP ONLY FACED OFF IN THE

01:41:16 GENERAL ELECTION AGAINST TWO PEOPLE. JONATHAN: IT IS BIZARRE.

01:41:22 YOU HAVE THE PRESIDENT EAGERLY AWAITING ANOTHER FACE-OFF WITH

01:41:25 THE FORMER PRESIDENT, AT THE SAME TIME NIKKI HALEY IS

01:41:27 HOLDING ON. LISA: THE PRESSURE WILL MOUNT ON HER.

01:41:30 ANNMARIE: IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT SHE SAYS

01:41:33 ABOUT HER HOME STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA, SHE IS BEHIND 40

01:41:34 POINTS. LISA: INTERESTING WHEN WE ASKED GARY

01:41:37 COHN, WHY ARE PEOPLE FEELING THAT IF THE ECONOMIC DATA IS SO

01:41:44 GOOD? IT IS TIME.

01:41:46 PEOPLE NEED TO ADJUST TO A 20% HIGHER GROCERY BILL.

01:41:49 WHEN IS THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ON THIS? JONATHAN:

01:41:53 GARY NAILED IT. CUMULATIVE INFLATION.

01:41:59 IT IS THE PAIN THAT PEOPLE FEEL FROM 2020, IT IS NOT MONTH OVER

01:42:00 MONTH. IT IS ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING

01:42:05 SINCE 2020 AND THE STICKER SHOCK OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS.

01:42:11 LISA: THE KEY QUESTION, WHAT IS THE

01:42:14 MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF TIME THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO LIVE WITH

01:42:16 INFLATION AT A CERTAIN LEVEL BEFORE IT BECOMES NORMAL AND

01:42:21 THEIR WAGE INCREASES IN A MORE MATERIAL WAY? JONATHAN:

01:42:24 S&P FUTURES POSITIVE BY HALF OF 1%. BOND YIELDS LOOK LIKE THIS,

01:42:28 DOWN TWO BASIS POINTS. 4.1051.

01:42:35 THE FED DECISION A WEEK AWAY. ECB DECISION A DAY AWAY.

01:42:42 COMING UP, MANDY XU OF CBOE GLOBAL MARKETS ON THE EQUITY

01:42:43 MARKETS. KEVIN MCCARTHY JOINING US

01:42:47 FOLLOWING TRUMP'S VICTORY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.

01:42:52 ANDREW HOLLENHORST LOOKING TO KEY INFLATION DATA THIS WEEK.

01:42:56 WE BEGIN WITH THE TOP STORY, STOCKS CONTINUING TO CLIMB.

01:43:02 MANDY XU SEEING MORE ROOM TO RUN, WRITING OPTIONS

01:43:04 POSITIONING MARKET IS STILL BIASED TOWARD FURTHER GAINS

01:43:07 DESPITE THE S&P MAKING ALL-TIME HIGHS, WE SEE ELEVATED DEMAND

01:43:10 FOR UPSIDE CALLS AS INVESTORS POSITION FOR FURTHER UPSIDE IN

01:43:11 THE MONTHS AHEAD. MANDY JOINS US ON THE TABLE.

01:43:18 WHY DO YOU BELIEVE THE PATH TO LESS RESISTANCE IS STILL HIGHER?

01:43:22 MANDY: THIS IS WHAT INVESTORS ARE

01:43:25 PUTTING MONEY TOWARD, BUYING THOSE UPSIDE CALLS.

01:43:28 A COUPLE THINGS STAND OUT TO US. LOOKING AT THE DEMAND FOR PUTS

01:43:35 VERSUS CALLS, THAT'S AT A MULTIYEAR LOW ACROSS ALL THE

01:43:37 MAJOR INDICES, PARTICULARLY RUSSELL 2000.

01:43:40 BACK TO THE QUESTION IF THIS IS A RALLY LED BY TECH.

01:43:44 NOW WE ARE STARTING TO SEE, NOVEMBER LAST YEAR, PEOPLE

01:43:48 PLAYING FOR POTENTIAL A OUT OF THAT RALLY.

01:43:53 S&P AT ALL-TIME HIGHS BUT THE RUSSELL IS STILL DOWN 20% FROM

01:43:56 ITS PEAK, STILL IN A BEAR MARKET.

01:43:59 THAT IS WHERE WE ARE SEEING MOST ELEVATED DEMAND. LISA:

01:44:04 HOW CROWDED IS POSITIONING, NOT JUST IN LONG POSITIONS BUT ALSO

01:44:07 IN THIS BROADENING OUT TRADE? MANDY:

01:44:11 TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF HOW EXTREME IT'S GOTTEN AT LEAST IN

01:44:13 THE DERIVATIVES MARKET, IF YOU LOOK AT THE SPREAD AND RUSSELL

01:44:21 VOLATILITY VERSUS OTHER VOLATILITY -- THAT IS USUALLY

01:44:24 DURING TIMES OF DURESS WHEN PEOPLE ARE PRICING IN MORE

01:44:28 RECESSION RISK. THIS TIME THE ENTIRE BID IS

01:44:32 COMING FROM THE UPSIDE. LISA: GIVEN THAT, HOW PRICED TO

01:44:36 PERFECTION IS THIS? THERE IS THIS QUESTION OF HOW

01:44:43 FRAGILE ARE SOME OF THESE POSITIONS TO JUST ONE DATA

01:44:45 POINT THAT COMES OUT THAT IS HIGHLY NEGATIVE? MANDY:

01:44:49 EVERYTHING IS DEPENDENT ON THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK.

01:44:51 THINGS COULD CHANGE PRETTY QUICKLY.

01:44:55 WE SEE IN THE RUSSELL, IT IS THE MOST REACTIVE UNECONOMIC

01:45:00 RELEASE DAYS, CPI, FOMC. THE MACRO NARRATIVE CAN CHANGE,

01:45:06 BUT EVERYWHERE I LOOK, THAT SOFT LANDING STORY IS

01:45:08 DEFINITELY WHAT IS BEING PRICED IN. JONATHAN:

01:45:11 WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING BETWEEN THE RUSSELL

01:45:12 AND THE S&P? S&P HITTING ALL-TIME HIGHS AND

01:45:17 THE RUSSELL CLIMBING OUT OF THE BEAR MARKET. MANDY:

01:45:21 THE REASON IT IS UNDERPERFORMING, MUCH MORE

01:45:23 OVERWEIGHT CYCLICAL SECTORS. GROWTH HAS BEEN SLOWING.

01:45:30 RIGHT NOW IT IS DRIVEN BY LOWER RATES, THE FED PIVOT THERE AND

01:45:32 IT. FOR THAT TO CONTINUE, YOU CAN

01:45:35 GROWTH TO PICK UP. I DON'T THINK A SOFT LANDING IS

01:45:39 ACTUALLY SUFFICIENT TO GET RUSSELL PERFORMANCE, YOU NEED

01:45:42 GROWTH TO ACCELERATE. GIVEN THE OUTLOOK FOR THIS YEAR

01:45:45 THAT MIGHT BE CHALLENGING. JONATHAN:

01:45:48 YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT EARNINGS. HOW RELEVANT ARE THE EARNINGS

01:45:50 THE SEASON? MANDY: EARNINGS ARE RELEVANT.

01:45:56 ONE MEASURE YOU CAN LOOK AT TO GET A GAUGE OF HOW MUCH YOU ARE

01:45:59 PRICING FOR EARNINGS IS DISPERSION.

01:46:04 DSPX TELLS YOU HOW MUCH HAVE BEEN PRICED IN THE NEXT 30 DAYS.

01:46:08 RIGHT NOW WE ARE SEEING IMPLIED DISPERSION IS LOWER THE LAST

01:46:11 EIGHT QUARTERS. IN SOME WAYS PEOPLE ARE PRICING

01:46:16 IN LES MOONVES ON EARNINGS, BUT OVERALL LEVELS ARE STILL

01:46:18 ELEVATED. GIVEN THE RUN-UP IN MARKETS,

01:46:23 EXPECTATIONS HAVE BUILT SUCH THAT THE HURDLE TO GET A

01:46:25 SIGNIFICANT MOVE ON EARNINGS IS HIGHER NOW. LISA:

01:46:28 AS YOU SPEAK, I THINK ABOUT THE RISK REWARD.

01:46:31 SPEAKING TO MICHAEL GAPEN, PRIYA MISRA, SAYING WE HAVE A

01:46:37 65% CHANCE OF A SOFT LANDING, 35% CHANCE OF A HARD LANDING.

01:46:43 I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU COME UP WITH THESE.

01:46:45 BUT IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THE OPTIONS MARKETS ARE

01:46:51 SHOWING, DOES IT AGREE, OR DO YOU SEE A MUCH HIGHER

01:46:53 PROBABILITY OF THAT SOFT LANDING BEING PRICED IN? MANDY:

01:46:57 I WOULD SAY WHAT IS BEING PRICED INTO THE OPTIONS MARKET

01:47:00 IS TILTED TOWARD THE SOFT LANDING.

01:47:02 IF YOU BELIEVE THERE IS A MEANINGFUL CHANCE OF RECESSION,

01:47:05 DEFINITELY VALUE IN LOOKING AT THOSE DOWNSIDE PUTS.

01:47:09 IT IS NOT JUST PUTS VERSUS CALLS. IF YOU LOOK AT IMPLIED

01:47:14 CORRELATION, THE MEASURE THAT I GO TO WHEN LOOKING AT

01:47:18 EXPECTATIONS FOR INFLATION. IN A RECESSION, EVERYTHING

01:47:22 SELLS ALTOGETHER. MEASURES OF IMPLIED

01:47:27 CORRELATION, MULTIYEAR LOWS CURRENTLY.

01:47:31 EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK IN THE EQUITY MARKET, IT IS REALLY

01:47:33 PRICING FOR THAT SOFT LANDING. LISA:

01:47:37 HOW MUCH IS THAT PEOPLE HEDGING FOR THE UPSIDE BECAUSE THAT IS

01:47:40 WHERE THEY GOT BEATEN UP, VERSUS HEDGING THE DOWNSIDE,

01:47:43 AND THEIR OWNERSHIP HAS NOT CHANGED MUCH? MANDY:

01:47:48 THAT IS THE MAIN STORY IN Q4. GOING INTO YEAR END, IT IS

01:47:54 REALLY A POSITIONING STORY, PERFORMANCE CHASE.

01:47:56 BUT WE ARE STARTING THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR AND THAT

01:47:57 IS STILL PERSISTING. PART OF IT COMES DOWN TO

01:47:59 SENTIMENT. JONATHAN: GOOD TO SEE YOU, MANDY XU, CBOE

01:48:04 GLOBAL MARKETS. ELSEWHERE THIS MORNING, LET'S

01:48:09 CATCH UP WITH YAHAIRA JACQUEZ. YAHAIRA:

01:48:12 DONALD TRUMP IS INCHING CLOSER

01:48:18 TO A REMATCH WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN.

01:48:25 AFTER CLAIMING VICTORY OVER FLORIDA GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS

01:48:26 IN THE IOWA CAUCUSES.

01:48:31 >> THIS IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL VICTORY SPEECH, BUT LET'S NOT

01:48:35 HAVE SOMEBODY TAKE A VICTORY WHEN SHE HAD A VERY BAD NIGHT.

01:48:37 SHE HAD A VERY BAD NIGHT. YAHAIRA:

01:48:42 SHARES OF NETFLIX ARE SURGING IN PREMARKET TRADING AFTER THE

01:48:45 FIRM POSTED ITS BEST CUSTOMER GROWTH SINCE ITS PANDEMIC PEAK.

01:48:49 THE STREAMING SERVICE ADDED MORE THAN 13 MILLION

01:48:53 SUBSCRIBERS IN THE LAST QUARTER OF 2023, EXCEEDING STREET

01:48:54 ESTIMATES. NETFLIX RECENTLY GAINED RIGHTS

01:49:01 TO DEBBIE W E'S RAW AS ITS FIRST LIVE CONTENT.

01:49:06 ALASKA AIR SAYS IT FOUND LOOSE BOLTS ON MANY OF THE BOEING 737

01:49:08 MAX 9 AIRCRAFTS. THE CEO SAID IN AN INTERVIEW

01:49:11 WITH NBC. IT COMES AFTER UNITED

01:49:18 AIRDROPPED R DROPPED PLANS WITHOUT

01:49:20 CANCELING AN ORDER. JONATHAN: THAT STORY GETS MORE AND MORE

01:49:23 SHOCKING. MORE ON THAT STORY LATER IN THE

01:49:26 HOUR. TRUMP ON THE CUSP OF A THIRD

01:49:30 GOP NOMINATION.

01:49:35 >> THIS IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL VICTORY SPEECH BUT LET'S NOT

01:49:37 HAVE SOMEBODY TAKE A VICTORY WHEN SHE HAD A VERY BAD NIGHT.

01:49:41 >> THIS RACE IS FAR FROM OVER. THERE ARE DOZENS OF STATES LEFT

01:49:43 TO GO. JONATHAN: THAT IS NEXT ON THE PROGRAM.

01:49:49 AROUND THE CORNER, THE FORMER HOUSE SPEAKER KEVIN MCCARTHY.

01:50:41 JONATHAN: ONE HOUR, 16 MINUTES AWAY FROM

01:50:42 THE OPENING TO. FOUR-DAY WINNING STREAK ON THE

01:50:45 S&P 500. EQUITY FUTURES POSITIVE BY 0.6%.

01:50:52 DOWN TWO BASIS POINTS THE 10-YEAR.

01:50:57 UNDER SURVEILLANCE, TRUMP ON THE CUSP OF A THIRD GOP

01:50:58 NOMINATION.

01:51:02 >> WE WON NEW HAMPSHIRE THREE TIMES NOW.

01:51:04 THIS IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL VICTORY SPEECH BUT LET'S NOT

01:51:08 HAVE SOMEBODY TAKE A VICTORY WHEN SHE HAD A VERY BAD NIGHT.

01:51:12 >> NEW HAMPSHIRE IS FIRST IN THE NATION, IT IS NOT THE LAST

01:51:14 IN THE NATION. THIS RACE IS FAR FROM OVER.

01:51:20 THERE ARE DOZENS OF STATES LEFT AGO. JONATHAN:

01:51:24 THE FORMER PRESIDENT DEFEATING NIKKI HALEY IN THE NEW

01:51:28 HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY. TRUMP CRUISING TO VICTORY BY

01:51:30 OVER 11%.

01:51:37 HALEY TRAILING BY OVER 30% IN HER HOME STATE OF SOUTH

01:51:38 CAROLINA NEXT MONTH. ANNMARIE: LOOKS LIKE SHE HAS A VERY STEEP

01:51:43 BATTLE WITH THE FORMER PRESIDENT UP 30%.

01:51:49 WHAT IT COMES TO INDEPENDENTS, SOME ARE WRITING WHERE THAT

01:51:50 COULD BE A VULNERABLE SPOT FOR TRUMP.

01:51:54 THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT TRUMP HAS AN ADORING BASE OF VOTERS

01:51:57 BUT THAT BASEMENT NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO WIN THE GENERAL

01:51:58 ELECTION. HE ALSO WRITES THERE IS ONE

01:52:04 AREA THAT IS TILTING TOWARD TRUMP, AND THIS IS IMMIGRATION,

01:52:06 BUT WHAT DOES THIS MEAN WHAT IS HAPPENING IN CONGRESS?

01:52:11 ARE DEMOCRATS GOING TO BE ABLE TO INK THIS DEAL BECAUSE THAT

01:52:14 WOULD GIVE A WIN TO BIDEN? JONATHAN:

01:52:18 LET'S START THE CONVERSATION WITH KEVIN MCCARTHY, FORMER

01:52:22 HOUSE SPEAKER. GOOD MORNING.

01:52:24 DO YOU JUST ASSUME NIKKI HALEY WILL LEAVE AND IT WILL BE TRUMP

01:52:26 VERSUS BIDEN ALL OVER AGAIN? KEVIN: YEAH.

01:52:31 ABOUT 30 DAYS BEFORE SOUTH CAROLINA.

01:52:3
