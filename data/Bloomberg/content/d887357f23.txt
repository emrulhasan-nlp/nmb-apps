00:07 Newsmakers and Market movers. This is the pulse with friends who like.

00:14 Well, good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Pulse and Francine Lacqua

00:17 here in London with the conversations that matter.

00:19 And here's what's coming up on today's program.

00:22 iPhone sales plunged 24% in China over the first six weeks of the year as

00:26 Apple's troubles in the country deepened.

00:29 China sets a growth target of around 5% that is described as ambitious.

00:33 As the Premier, Li acknowledges, the challenges facing the world's second

00:37 largest economy, plus the Supreme Court rules that Donald Trump can appear on

00:40 the ballot in November ahead of Super Tuesday.

00:43 We'll bring you the latest in the race for the White House.

00:46 Also, a little bit later this hour, we speak to Hamdi Okoya, the founder and

00:49 chief executive of Chobani, the best selling yogurt brand in the U.S.

00:53 He's spearheading a campaign along with 70 major firms, including Amazon, Bank

00:57 of America and Bloomberg, to connect, recruit and train refugees in the

01:02 workforce. Now, let's take a look at the European

01:04 market map. A lot of the focus, of course, here in

01:07 Europe is also what we'll hear from the testimony of Jay Powell.

01:10 The other thing we watch for is Rafael Bostic, who also on the website and in a

01:15 speech yesterday, let understand that it's in the third quarter that he's

01:18 inspecting cuts, then followed by a pause, and he's worried about the

01:22 exuberance possibly in the business community.

01:25 Now, stocks edging a little bit lower. China's new targets have many, many

01:29 questions from many analysts in terms of how much stimulus and support they'll

01:33 bring together. And of course, it's I guess the market

01:37 is now shifting from China to Jay Powell a little bit later on and then the jobs

01:40 report also later in the week. So Apple's iPhone sales in China

01:43 declined by 24% over the first six weeks of the year, pushing it to fourth

01:49 quarter alone. Smartphone vendors in the country,

01:52 that's according to the latest data from Counterpoint Research.

01:54 Now, the California tech giant lost the title of China's best selling smartphone

01:59 maker to Chinese company Vivo, who appears to have done a better job of

02:03 targeting the budget segment of the market.

02:05 You can see Apple down 1%. To discuss Apple and China.

02:09 Let's get straight to Bloomberg's Oliver Cook in just a moment.

02:12 But first, let's go to Beijing, where China has set its annual growth target

02:15 of 5%, matching last year's figure raising expectations of more stimulus.

02:20 Bloomberg's chief North Asia correspondent, Stephen Engle is

02:23 following the story. So good morning to both of you.

02:25 Stephen, how difficult will the target be to be achieved?

02:31 It will be difficult. And I'm saying that with good confidence

02:34 because the premier, Li Keqiang, said the same thing.

02:37 He said, it's not easy for us to reach these targets.

02:40 We need policy support from all fronts. So there it is.

02:44 But he didn't really lay out any specifics on what kind of stimulus that

02:48 would be coming down the pipe, because there are numerous headwinds, obviously,

02:52 in the Chinese economy, be it property which is ongoing, be it consumer

02:56 confidence. And Oliver is going to talk about that

02:59 and the drop off for Apple. Obviously, big ticket consumer items

03:04 have been falling all across the board on the consumer front, whether it's

03:08 cars, refrigerators, obviously houses. But we'll get to that a little bit

03:13 later. But there's also fiscal debt issues at

03:16 the local government level. There is ongoing entrenched deflation

03:23 across the board. So for Lee Chong, the premier, to set

03:26 the the GDP target as the same target as previously a year ago is quite ambitious

03:34 because of all those headwinds. And we all know that a 2023 was not a

03:38 pretty picture for the Chinese economy. They also set a target for 3% CPI.

03:44 We're in deflation here, so they must be confident that they can reach that 5%

03:49 growth target and 3% CPI. The big question and why the markets

03:54 kind of reacted with a ha and a shrug is where's that stimulus going to come

04:00 from? Right.

04:01 So, Stephen, my question is, how much stimulus are we actually expecting then?

04:08 Well, Xi Jinping, for one, has been steadfast in saying and he said it 128

04:13 times in various speeches last year. He wants high quality development.

04:17 That essentially means they're going to sacrifice some GDP growth for more

04:22 sustainable growth. But we don't know where that's going to

04:26 come from because he is also launching a have been launched in right in the

04:31 middle of a derisking and deleveraging campaign, in particular in property.

04:36 We have not seen huge rescues of property developers.

04:39 We have seen state support, though, and we saw it in the work report today in

04:43 the tune of long term, essentially central government issued bonds to the

04:50 tune of Â¥1 trillion. That will help, you know, you know,

04:55 bridge the fiscal gap, because they also said the ratio from GDP to GDP, the

05:03 budget deficit to GDP at just 3%. So that indicates they're not really

05:08 willing to roll out large fiscal stimulus because they don't want to

05:11 exacerbate those debt burdens at the local government level.

05:14 So they're in a they're in a quandary. And they admitted fully that they is

05:19 going to be a tough task. They need consumer confidence to come

05:22 back. They need exports to rebound a little

05:25 bit. But that's an external situation out of

05:27 their control. But they don't want to exacerbate the

05:30 debt problems. Stephen, thank you so much for Stephen

05:33 Engle there, of course, following this party conference very closely.

05:36 Let's also talk Apple iPhone sales in China declined by 24% over the first six

05:41 weeks of the year, pushing it to the fourth among smartphone vendors in the

05:45 country. That's according to the latest data from

05:47 Counterpoint Research. Let's get straight to Ali Crook.

05:50 Ali, is this an Apple story or a China story?

05:54 Yeah, well, invariably it's going to be a bit of both, like so many companies on

05:57 the planet. I mean, where I usually sit in Berlin,

05:59 we talk about this with all the executives that sell massively into

06:02 China, whether it's carmakers or chips or all that sort of thing.

06:05 It's everyone's been talking about a rebound in the back half of the year for

06:08 two years. It just has not come.

06:10 And you see that weakness now. You see it in China and you see it in

06:12 the sales. I mean, down 24% for an iPhone.

06:15 Sales in just the first six week of the year is absolutely mammoth.

06:18 This is the biggest smart smartphone market in the world.

06:22 So, yes, there is this that question. And of course, Apple is selling a

06:25 premium product when you have a lot of competitors that have a much better

06:28 price point. I mean, Apple has been eroding, eroding

06:31 market share. They're down now to about 60% of the

06:33 market share in China. They were at 19% last year, and they're

06:36 losing more ground steadily. But overall, you know, the overall

06:39 market for smartphones was down also 7%. So there is definite weakness that is

06:43 coming across across the market. So why did rivals in China?

06:48 What did they do differently that actually did better than Apple?

06:53 Well, one of the main issues is going to be exactly that question of the premium.

06:56 There are cheaper phones, but they're also very good phones.

06:59 And there's also a huge amount of effort and energy in China to really get that

07:03 tech independence and to sort of raise up its own producers of phones.

07:08 So, for example, you know, there's this question of patriotic buying, right?

07:11 Huawei came out with this new phone that the state media was really touting,

07:14 saying that this is really a great response to us sort of tech and chip

07:18 supremacy and Huawei in those six weeks, while everybody was down there, sales

07:22 were up 64%, which is absolutely mammoth.

07:25 And we should also say that this is sort of eclipsed the story.

07:27 But for Apple, they have a problem in China.

07:29 They've got a problem here in Brussels, too, with this huge fine that's coming

07:32 down the pipeline. So these are all things to watch as

07:35 Apple will face problems in China and more regulatory scrutiny here in

07:38 Brussels. Oh, thank you so much.

07:42 Oliver Crook there in Brussels. Now, later today, Oliver also speaks to

07:46 the EU commission's competition chief following that big news of Apple being

07:50 fined and said to have hit a U.S. government roadblock.

07:54 Meanwhile, while attempting to sell an A.I.

07:56 chip tailored for the Chinese market, it's part of Washington's crackdown on

08:00 the export of advanced technologies to the country.

08:02 Bloomberg has learned AMD had hoped to gain a green light from the Commerce

08:06 Department to sell the AI processor to Chinese customers.

08:10 The chip is said to have a lower performance than what AMD sells outside

08:14 of China and was designed to meet U.S. exports restrictions.

08:16 Not to talk about all of this. We're also joined by Arnav Das, global

08:19 market strategist at Invesco Asset Management.

08:22 Thank you so much for joining us. A lot of the focus, of course, is on

08:24 China, on how a lot of the big conglomerates, you know, actually sell

08:28 to China, but also what the China consumer's looking at.

08:31 How do you view China going forward? Well, look, I think they've had a very

08:34 different experience of the pandemic than the rest of the world, particularly

08:38 the West, right here in the west. We had big fiscal transfers.

08:42 China had a much more responsible approach to fiscal policy.

08:45 And so ordinary people had to bear the burden of the lockdown.

08:48 Right. So they didn't have the kind of income

08:50 effect that we all got from fiscal transfers.

08:54 They had to bear a fall in the equity market, a fall in the real estate

08:58 market. We had the opposite here, right?

09:00 So you had positive income effect, positive wealth effect.

09:03 We made out like bandits, right? During during the pandemic, they had the

09:06 opposite. So I think a large part of what's going

09:09 on at the moment is kind of macro, right, is that consumers, households are

09:14 still repairing their balance sheets and nursing their wounds from the pandemic

09:17 and from the real estate market. What does that mean for policies?

09:21 Will policymakers really step in? I mean, we've been waiting for some kind

09:23 of extra stimulus. I mean, there's a fragile real estate

09:26 market. There's, as you say, also they're

09:28 suffering from geopolitics between the US and China.

09:31 Right. And I think a lot of these things will

09:33 continue. They're sort of structural, like the

09:36 geopolitical rivalry. There's also the demographic transition

09:39 that China is already going through has been exacerbated right by the pandemic.

09:43 So, look, I think there is some stimulus and they are doing, you know, some

09:48 measures to accelerate growth. But I think they're they're taking a

09:51 kind of responsible approach in a way. Right.

09:53 They don't want to have another debt binge and other kind of fiscally pushed

09:56 credit binge that drives the real estate market or drives infrastructure right

10:01 through the roof. I mean, so, you know, one of your

10:03 colleagues was saying how Xi Jinping wants higher quality, more sustainable

10:08 growth. Right.

10:10 I think that's right. If they get 5%.

10:12 What do they need to do to actually achieve 5%?

10:15 Well, I think that's going to have to come.

10:16 You know, if they're going to hit 5%, it's an ambitious target that's

10:19 aspirational. If they get close to it, it'll be

10:22 because productivity is rising rather than because of demographics or big

10:27 increases in capital that associated with debt.

10:29 Right. So I think the question that we have to

10:31 ask ourselves is where is that productivity boom going to come from?

10:36 And I think, you know, they have in mind I they have in mind the EVs.

10:39 They have in mind. You know, high tech of various kinds,

10:41 green technology. And that can help.

10:43 The question is whether it's big enough to move the needle, enough to substitute

10:48 for real estate and infrastructure. And I would say, you know, probably come

10:51 in somewhere south of five. Interesting.

10:54 Ana, thanks so much. Ana stays with us and we'll have plenty

10:56 more, of course, on China. And we'll talk a Fed as well.

10:59 Much more to come. We have a full roundup of markets.

11:02 This is.

11:20 Well, Raphael Bostic, the Atlanta Fed president, says he expects the Federal

11:23 Reserve to cut interest rates once in the third quarter before pausing.

11:26 His comments also come ahead of a testimony from the Fed chair, Jay

11:29 Powell, who's set to appear at Congress tomorrow.

11:32 We're now joined by Noor Al Ali from our Markets live team.

11:35 And we continue the conversation with Arnab Das, global market strategist

11:38 Invesco Asset Management. So thank you both for sticking around or

11:43 coming on. When you look at the Fed, I mean,

11:45 there's been last year the markets, frankly, were all over the place where

11:48 it's been a soft landing, no landing. And they were kind of like zigzagging.

11:52 Do you feel more confident that we have a clearer path that was committed in,

11:56 you know, communicate in what kind of inflation will get and what that means

11:59 for the Fed? Look, I think we're pretty much done

12:03 with the tightening process. I guess they put the idea, some of them,

12:06 some of the family members and Larry Summers, of course, put the idea of

12:10 another hike back on the table. We think that's quite unlikely.

12:13 We're probably done. The real question is how fast is

12:16 inflation going to come down? And in order to let the Fed start

12:21 cutting rates, in order to maintain the real rate where it is and not have this

12:25 kind of passive tightening. Right.

12:27 So I would say I think we're looking at that in the second half of the year.

12:30 Maybe it feels a bit like Waiting for Godot.

12:32 Right? Because we've been talking about

12:34 talking about this for a long time. But, you know, the flipside of that is

12:37 that the that growth resilience, right. The labor market is, as you note, Right.

12:41 Very strong economy, strong the consumer strong.

12:45 The economy overall is strong. There are pockets of weaknesses.

12:47 And people talk about this kind of rolling recession.

12:50 You know, we're in the kind of camp that says, you know, everybody tries to come

12:53 up with a cliche, right? Ours is bumpy landing.

12:55 Not a soft landing. Not a hard landing.

12:57 Not even what blinder Alan Blinder called a soft landing, but one that,

13:01 like you said, has a lot of volatility, a lot of zig zagging, because, you know,

13:05 the longer financial conditions remain easy and the longer the labor market

13:10 remains tight, the higher, longer and higher for longer will prevail.

13:14 And some stuff is going to start to come under pressure as that happens.

13:18 And that I mean, what do you see as coming under pressure?

13:22 I know there's there's a lot of chatter about, you know, productivity, which

13:25 could also change under some policies. We have a big election.

13:29 Bitcoin was one of the things that people point at certain Mark.

13:33 Jp morgan is saying, well, this is a sign of frothiness in the market, 100%.

13:36 Right. And you've seen, you know, those those

13:39 risky assets come off the highs, you know, European futures into the morning

13:43 and as they've opened in U.S. stock futures as well, Bitcoin as well,

13:46 all have really kind of you know, I don't want to say, you know, there's

13:50 sort of a temporary pullback that you've seen and dare I say it, could it be, you

13:54 know, on the back of that somewhat disappointing or lukewarm reception that

13:59 investors had out of China, but also, you know, preparations for a potentially

14:03 more hawkish than expected? POWELL Later.

14:06 And I think that's sort of feeding into the overall theme that perhaps, you

14:10 know, that risk asset rally is going to take a breather.

14:14 Now, momentum is very much there. You know, there aren't a lot of reasons

14:17 that are stopping these stocks from rallying, even though we've had, you

14:21 know, as you said, Waiting for Godot is a very good kind of way to describe the

14:25 idea that there's not much that's going to pull stocks lower because all the

14:29 momentum points to the fact that, you know, we're pretty much in the rally.

14:33 We've had the Fed push back. Now, whether or not Powell kind of sets

14:37 it up for a more hawkish set up could be quite interesting as well.

14:42 And that's what we're seeing in the markets today.

14:44 What's the good news that's left in the economy?

14:46 Arnab And I guess this is the only question that markets should really ask

14:49 themselves. Well, I think you said it productivity,

14:52 right? I mean, we've had a resilient economy,

14:54 we've had growth holding up labour market, holding up inflation falling.

14:58 Right. So the residual clearly is that

15:00 productivity is rising. Some people are even talking about a

15:03 productivity boom. That may be overstating it, but it does

15:06 seem that there's something structural changing in the US economy and maybe in

15:10 the world as a whole. Right.

15:12 Partly as a result of the pandemic, partly as a result of the geopolitics,

15:15 partly as a result of industrial policy. These are not things that are easy to

15:20 get right. Right.

15:21 And it's actually probably much easier to get them wrong if history is any

15:24 guide. But I think the US has done something

15:27 here which is which is working right. It may not be winning the election for

15:31 Sleepy Joe. Right.

15:32 But it is it does seem to be working for the economy and for labour.

15:37 Do you worry that actually the economy overheats?

15:39 And if there is a mismatch between, I guess, what President Biden has put in

15:43 place, why are Americans not feeling it? Well, I think there is a risk, but I

15:47 think it's just a tail risk. I think the big picture here is that

15:50 inflation is coming down. Labour market is tight, but wages are

15:54 not taking off. Right.

15:55 So I think it's working generally very well.

15:58 Why is it not working politically? Well, I think that, you know, sort of

16:01 levels versus rates of change. Right.

16:04 We're all talking about how inflation is coming down.

16:06 Right. The rate of growth of prices is coming

16:08 down. What people have been hit by is a big a

16:11 big shock to real incomes and real wealth.

16:14 Right. They're feeling the level as being much

16:17 higher of prices. And other kinds of pressures that

16:20 ordinary people feel. And of course, for ordinary people in

16:23 the US, the margins are not very big. Right?

16:26 So I think you can sort of understand where the average Joe is coming from.

16:31 Right. Yeah.

16:32 And I don't know how this feeds into the markets, but of course, we look at kind

16:36 of the repercussions across the board 100%.

16:38 And to your point about the US consumer, you know, that resilience of the US

16:42 consumer has been something that's awfully noted, you know, especially in

16:46 the tax season. That's why a lot of people say, well,

16:48 you know, you see that risk sentiment really pouring into those, you know,

16:51 riskier assets than normal. That's what's been driving, you know,

16:55 the tech gains. Of course, there's also that momentum of

16:58 it. Right.

16:59 You know, AIG and its impact on the consumer and job habits and patterns

17:04 have really changed the dynamics of the consumer today.

17:08 And I think, you know, we've had a lot of pessimism coming out of 2023 now, and

17:12 there's so much of it that's been misplaced that I think the rally can

17:16 continue into stocks. You know, I'm I'm the resident pessimist

17:20 in my team, and I'm always the one that's looking for the contrarian view.

17:23 But it's really hard for me to look at the data out there today and say, oh,

17:27 that's going to be the thing that's going to drive us out there.

17:29 But unless you get a steady stream of data that really points to that pain

17:34 that you're talking about, there is no point for markets to stop rallying.

17:37 At least that's what traders see. That's what traders see until they're

17:40 wrong. Thank you both for joining us.

17:42 Noor Ali from our market live team and Art Das, global market strategist at

17:46 INVESCO Asset Management. Coming up, the most important day so far

17:49 in the race for the White House has arrived.

17:52 Yes, we're talking Super Tuesday. That's next.

17:55 And this is Bloomberg.

18:11 Now the US Supreme Court says Donald Trump can appear on presidential ballots

18:15 this November. The unanimous decision overturned a

18:17 Colorado Supreme Court ruling barring him from running again due to his

18:21 efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss.

18:24 Now it comes as Colorado and 14 other states hold primaries today on Super

18:28 Tuesday, the biggest day so far in the 2024 race for the White House.

18:33 Now let's bring in Bloomberg's critic Gupta.

18:35 Good morning. So was the Supreme Court decision a

18:38 shock? Good morning, friend.

18:39 It wasn't a shock in terms of the actual result.

18:42 There is an expectation. There's so much momentum here for

18:44 President Trump. It would have been a real shock if he

18:46 had had been allowed to run. The shock comes in the fact that this

18:49 was a unanimous decision. At the end of the day, both liberal and

18:52 conservative justices both ultimately agreeing that this actually doesn't hold

18:56 in court, but for different reasons. Fran, the liberal suggesting here that's

18:59 actually a question of whether or not states even have the right to enforce

19:03 the Constitution when at the end of the day it is a federal declaration and that

19:08 is a power that only Congress can do. Conservatives, on the other hand, are

19:11 saying that that's actually more of a story of whether or not Trump is

19:15 actually criminally indicted at the end of the day.

19:17 So, again, two different takes on what if at the end a unanimous ruling in that

19:21 President Trump can actually run on the ballots and if he does indeed need to be

19:25 taken off the ballot, that's only something that Congress can enact.

19:29 And pretty frankly, Donald Trump is expected to win big today.

19:32 So what happens to his only challenger, Nikki Haley?

19:35 Well, that's going to be the question, right?

19:36 Does she end up dropping out? Does she run as a third party candidate?

19:39 The issue with Nikki Haley is she has so much donor backing, far more donor

19:43 backing than President Trump has and given the legal fees that have really

19:46 amounted to him. He needs that donor backing.

19:49 So it's not just about the 64 point margin of victory, by the way, that he

19:53 has in the polls right now against Nikki Haley on a national basis.

19:56 It's also about the fact that if Nikki Haley drops out after Super Tuesday, is

20:01 he able to kind of scoop up some of the donors that she had?

20:04 And does she actually endorse President Trump for the general election at a time

20:08 when she's been very outspoken about really being the anti-Trump candidate,

20:12 being the fiscal conservative candidate? On the other hand, you've got President

20:15 Biden, for example, also trying to see if he has the backing of Democrats.

20:20 Remember, in the Michigan primary, it was a great example of the fact that

20:23 several people came out and said they were uncommitted simply as a protest of

20:27 a foreign policy stance. Both could be longer term trends in the

20:30 general election. Fran.

20:32 Great. Thanks so much, Kirti Gupta there with

20:33 the very latest, of course, on the U.S. election.

20:36 It's a big day. Super Tuesday, stay what?

20:38 Stay with us for special coverage of Super Tuesday.

20:41 That starts at 9 p.m.. New york times.

20:44 It's middle of the night. I would still get up and watch it on

20:47 Bloomberg TV. Coming up, we'll look at the launch of

20:49 Tent U.K., a partnership where leading companies committed to actively

20:53 supporting refugees and their workforces.

21:09 Now iPhone sales plunged 24% in China over the first six weeks of this year.

21:13 As Apple's troubles in the country deepened, China sets a growth target of

21:17 around 5% that it describes as ambitious.

21:20 As Premier, Li acknowledges the challenges facing the world's second

21:24 largest economy, plus the Supreme Court rules that Donald Trump can appear on

21:28 the ballot in November ahead of Super Tuesday.

21:30 We'll bring you the latest in the race for the White House.

21:33 Well, good morning, everyone, and welcome to The Pulse.

21:35 I'm Francine Lacqua here in London. Now, this week is also the launch of the

21:39 UK coalition, where leading companies commit to actively supporting refugees

21:43 in their workforces. 70 firms are backing the initiative to

21:47 connect, recruit and train refugees, including Amazon, Bank of America and

21:53 Bloomberg. The Global Ten Partnership is made up of

21:56 more than 400 companies worldwide across different industries.

22:00 Spearheading the campaign is Hamdy Olukoya, the founder and chief executive

22:04 of Chobani. Now, after moving to the United States,

22:07 Hamdi launched Chobani in 2007, which became $1,000,000,000 brand and is today

22:12 the best selling yogurt in the US. Mohammed Ulukaya joins us now.

22:15 Thank you so much for joining us. This is an exciting day because it's

22:18 also the launch of 10th UK. How did the initiative actually start?

22:23 I mean, this is trying to give refugees a chance, but also economically to be

22:27 financially independent. Have companies been forthcoming?

22:31 I mean, I have to say when the light launched that it was in the back of

22:35 Chobani success, which I tried to dig in and find out what happened here.

22:40 And in my journey, I realized that when we start Chobani from this old factory

22:44 in upstate New York with few people, and as we grew and hired more, one of the

22:48 most remarkable thing that we've done after hiring everybody local is letting

22:52 refugees was settled legally nearby towns to come in and be part of Chobani.

22:58 And the question was then, and same as what it is today, what are the what are

23:02 the obstacles for a refugee to be part of a job?

23:05 It is language, it's transportation, simple as it is not having a driver's

23:10 license or cars or not having the perfect right training for the job that

23:14 is available and the unknown. Who are these people, where they come

23:18 from, what's going to happen? And I think job answers all of that

23:21 stuff and what happens the minute they get a job, that's the minute they stop

23:25 being a refugee and companies benefit from it, as Chobani did.

23:28 And I, I, i credit most of the success of Chobani has been diversified

23:33 workforce, but everyone can come in and put their best to it.

23:37 But how important is it, for example, to do so?

23:39 I know you've had initiatives around the world.

23:41 You started in the U.S., you had one France and now in the UK.

23:44 I mean, the UK is a small open economy with an extremely tight labor market,

23:49 right? How much of a difference could this

23:51 make? Well, here we are.

23:54 This is the last the biggest lunch that we had.

23:57 We had Mexico, 50 of them. We had other countries, we had 11

24:01 countries, 400, as you said, 400 multinational, large companies.

24:04 This is the biggest coalition we lunch to the day, which is 70 companies.

24:11 Some of them are British iconic brands like BP and and and and some of them

24:16 are, you know, international Marriott and Bloomberg.

24:20 We have we have data that 20% of the companies, ten, ten or more employee

24:28 companies are having a shortage of labour.

24:30 Can't fill it. And some numbers, over a million.

24:33 We have 500,000 refugees here in UK. Half of them are Ukrainian.

24:37 Some of them are from Hong Kong, some of them from other countries legally

24:41 saddled, ready to work and having a hard time to find jobs.

24:44 So what it does is connect them together and share experiences globally, and we

24:49 connect with each other partners of the companies and work tirelessly through

24:53 the years. And our office here in UK, in the

24:56 service of companies to make sure that it's a success.

24:59 Why do you think chief executives want to do this?

25:01 Is this because they want to do good because it's the right thing to do?

25:03 Or is it really to fill a vacuum in the workforce?

25:05 I think we call this win win, win, win win, and it never ends.

25:09 It continues to win. I mean, is good for the refugees.

25:12 It is the minute they have their back to their life.

25:15 Second, companies benefit from this dramatically, dramatically.

25:19 Culture, productivity, innovation, you know, commitment for long term.

25:24 Massive, massive effect. But what you see is you get rewarded by

25:27 the population. We did a study in UK.

25:30 Most of the population rewards companies who are higher in refugees and young

25:35 talent want to join the companies who are high refugees and be part of this

25:39 humanitarian crisis. So we have this global humanitarian

25:42 crisis, but yet companies are leaning forward, is really creating an

25:46 environment for everyone to join and be part of the solution.

25:50 In the end, you have a companies who are leaning forward now and doing that for

25:55 business to right for humanity and community are the ones who are going to

25:58 be relevant in the future.

26:01 And long time. We speak to a lot of chief executives

26:04 that say, look, it's actually harder, much harder to push a social agenda, to

26:08 push a, you know, climate change agenda. Right.

26:11 Because of politics right now. Would you agree with that, that it's

26:13 actually harder to be a chief executive that does good?

26:17 Yes, this is a big question, and I think no one questions this tomorrow's

26:23 question are going to raise companies. They are pure purpose of to make money

26:30 for their shareholders. That idea is an old idea.

26:32 Everybody knows it. Now, when you are for common humanity

26:37 and community and environment, these are not against the business or success of

26:42 business. The only question is you have to look at

26:46 all dimension of the business to implement, to truly not just check the

26:49 box and you have to commit for a long time.

26:52 And that is basically come down to the shareholders of these companies need to

26:56 ask the CEOs to commit to these values for a long time.

27:00 And everybody I would say we broke all the records.

27:03 I will tie it back into commitment to humanity.

27:06 Do you do worry? I mean, it's very difficult to not to

27:08 look at, you know, American television without talking about the US-Mexico

27:13 border, about, I guess, anger or even hate in certain cases, also in certain

27:18 parts of Europe against immigrants. How does this end?

27:23 Well, the saddest part and I am I'm a Kurd from Turkey, and I moved when I was

27:27 21 years old from Turkey to New York. And I didn't want to move.

27:32 And I had to move. I had to move.

27:34 And I got a new life for myself. And I hope that I created some better

27:38 world surrounding me. Migration is a reality, is going to be

27:43 here and be here for better. If it's not conflict, it's going to be,

27:48 you know, famine, it's going to be environment.

27:51 And it has been throughout the history, throughout the year.

27:54 And every single study shows and I'm talking about orderly

28:00 migration shows that the communities and companies and the cities and towns who

28:06 welcome and create an environment for everyone to be proud of, they get the

28:11 benefit in the end. Innovation happens.

28:13 I mean, look at this country. This country is on the backs of

28:16 migrations and it creates so much throughout the world and there's always

28:20 leading. And and that's a reality.

28:22 Unfortunately, politics is politics. And you look at the reality in the US

28:28 right after the last election and after politics, all the cities and, you know,

28:33 the states that they know how the refugees and and and illegal immigration

28:38 does in their communities. They want them in their towns and

28:40 villages because always something new comes up and it's the reality.

28:44 Politics is going to happen. But we have to do what's right for the

28:48 long term for people and for communities.

28:51 And I also wanted to talk to a little bit about Chovanec.

28:53 So people look at you as really, you know, the poster child of a clever

28:57 businessman that's made it in not that many years.

29:00 You've also recently done an acquisition.

29:02 So now you have coffee. A coffee is an Italian.

29:04 It really speaks to me. But how are you expecting that market to

29:07 grow and how do you expect the two to play, you know, yogurt and and coffee?

29:11 Yeah, I think in the US and I had an attempt in the UK people don't know I

29:15 was talking to the my drivers were coming here I tried to enter in this

29:19 market and the market in Australia we had number one in Australia and one day

29:24 I might have my cup. I love this country.

29:27 Food is an exciting place. Back to natural back to good grades,

29:33 especially the post-pandemic reality. And, you know, ingredients, of course,

29:40 accessibility, these are major, major things.

29:42 So we built Chobani with a very simple idea.

29:46 Good food is filled with good ingredients and accessible price and

29:52 available for all. And that idea worked.

29:54 And now we're expanding. So we added oat milk.

29:57 We added coffee creamers, which is food and design in in Italy, in Florence.

30:04 My friends, they designed the packaging and now we're adding coffee.

30:09 I think the food and beverage is having the second spring, in my opinion.

30:14 But is it changing? I mean, we speak a lot, you know, also

30:16 to Novo Nordisk because of Cmpc and some of these, you know, weight loss drugs.

30:21 What's the relationship going to be? I think I think post-pandemic people

30:25 understood the food is extremely important, how they consume, what they

30:27 consume. I think

30:30 it's hard to break it true, because these companies are major, big

30:34 companies. They've been around for a long, long

30:35 time. For a startup to stay independent and

30:38 break through it and disrupt a category like coffee.

30:41 I mean, you're talking about ready to drink coffee.

30:43 In the US, the major brand is got 43 grams of sugar that's 30 sugar cubes in

30:49 a bottle of cup. And that's just that's just wrong.

30:53 Real innovation, good innovation. That's what people bring with lack along

30:57 is coffee that people drink cold. Now, just like in Italy, you know, you

31:02 have your expresso, but there's this new trend.

31:05 75% of the people they consume their coffee called even in the wintertime,

31:08 even in New York. But can this can it be wholesome

31:11 ingredients, very little sugar, Not not too much.

31:14 And it can be a daily habit because 90% of population, adult population drinks

31:19 coffee almost every day. This is benefits that more and more

31:22 coming out by giving something that's a little bit more, I guess, fitness

31:26 conscious. You know, you'll get through.

31:28 This is the way the trend is going. Exactly.

31:30 And, you know, we're all busy during the day.

31:34 You know, we're busy moms, busy dad, busy workers.

31:37 You know what is feeling you naturally I think it's it's food, it's well-being.

31:44 And it's surrounded, you know, with friends and family.

31:46 These are all important. But stuff like food, we can make it

31:50 better. It's be proved that Chobani it's simple

31:54 without preservatives, something that we can name and pronounce the ingredients.

31:58 Even myself, who I learn English later, it's extremely important.

32:02 I think it comes down to one simple things is maybe coffee doesn't apply to

32:06 that, but any food, as I see we make, if we don't serve to our children, our

32:10 family, we shouldn't be serving anybody else.

32:12 Good benchmark. How big do you want to grow?

32:14 And actually, I know there was talk about a possible IPO.

32:16 Yes. Is this something that's still on the

32:18 cards? Still in the cards?

32:20 We have not made that decision. Companies in a very healthy place.

32:25 We grow double digit volume and and and dollar gained shares.

32:30 And it's pretty amazing what's happening at Chobani.

32:33 I contribute to all the people that that passionately work at the place.

32:37 We have no pressure our employees are 10% owner of company and I want them to

32:44 get an access to the wealth that we have generated and that would be a reason I

32:49 would do it. And second is to grow this company

32:51 further. I personally believe I'm not big into,

32:55 you know, making what, 3 to 6 billion. But as you grow, your impact get grows

33:00 and you get to do more things and it gives me a little smile.

33:04 So we'll see. I mean, we have quite a bit of options.

33:08 One of them would be that. And what do you attribute your success

33:11 to? People

33:13 are really, of course, America, upstate New York, Idaho.

33:17 I mean, America is a magical place, but the people people I work with every

33:22 day, refugees, immigrants, people come from what backs of background and do the

33:26 right thing. Everybody wants to do the right thing.

33:28 And the business is a great environment for everyone to come and join and focus

33:33 on the common goal, make good food, build life around it, and make the world

33:38 a better place. That's not war.

33:40 It's just having fun. And I could talk to you for another

33:43 hour, but we do. I thank you.

33:45 Look at you are the founder and chief executive of Chobani now coming up.

33:50 But we talk geopolitics and Gaza ceasefire talks stall as Israel delay

33:54 sending negotiators until Hamas answers queries.

33:57 We'll have the latest on the war next. And this is Bloomberg.

34:17 Well, hopes for a cease fire in Gaza have been dampened as Israel delay

34:21 sending a negotiator to Cairo for talks with Hamas.

34:24 Now Israel says it will not do so until Hamas provides a list of the Israeli

34:28 hostages it intends to free in return for a pause in the fighting.

34:31 Bloomberg's EMEA news director, Roslyn Matheson, is here.

34:34 So where are we with the cease fire talks?

34:38 Well, the ceasefire talks as much as they are a very much bogged down in

34:42 Cairo. Israel has not, as you said, decided to

34:44 send a delegation for now. There is a Hamas presence there.

34:48 There are conversations going on, but it's very difficult to get any traction

34:52 with that Israel present, as you say. The major sticking point seems to be

34:56 that Israel wants an update on the status of all its hostages inside Gaza,

35:01 who they are, where they are, their health and so on, before it agrees to

35:04 have the proper conversation around a ceasefire.

35:06 Hamas says that's too difficult at this point in time.

35:10 And so we can't even get to the point where we've got people properly around

35:12 the table having that conversation. We knew the talks had been bogged down

35:16 for days. The question is, is there any kind of

35:18 way through in the next few days? Is there a path forward before we get

35:22 into Ramadan, into the into the Islamic holy month, a holy period when Israel

35:28 has indicated it might be prepared to go forward with its offensive inside Gaza?

35:32 The real impetus is to get this cease fire done before we get into Ramadan

35:36 itself. We're also the U.S.

35:37 says the situation in Gaza is simply intolerable.

35:40 Israel denies that people are starving. How is that possible?

35:43 Well, what we've seen is a lot of photographic evidence that people are in

35:46 quite desperate states inside Gaza. Of course, when you've got a war and

35:50 you've got a lot of people moving around quickly, you've got people fighting,

35:54 you've got aerial bombardment, there's a lot of disruption.

35:57 And that just means that people's daily lives are affected no matter what their

36:00 ability to access food, water, medicine, shelter and so on, regardless of

36:05 anything else. Israel's point is they say there is

36:07 actually a decent food supply, water supply and so on inside Gaza.

36:11 They accuse Hamas of deliberately disrupting those supplies and not

36:15 allowing people to be properly fed. International aid agencies, those who

36:19 have some kind of look inside what's happening inside Gaza say the situation

36:23 is, in fact, very, very dire. Some aid is getting in, but it's not

36:27 getting distributed well. Of course, we know they're now resorting

36:30 to air drops as well. You know, it's very clear that there is

36:33 a significant humanitarian problem going on inside Gaza, regardless of where the

36:38 supplies are going at the moment. More developments also in the Red Sea.

36:41 What can you tell us about that? Well, we know the Houthis say they've

36:44 hit another ship in the Red Sea. Of course, they sank one, their first

36:48 ship that sank recently after drifting for several weeks.

36:52 We know the Houthis are keeping up that campaign of targeting shipping in the

36:56 Red Sea. It does seem to type it a bit, but it's

36:58 enough that most ships are still opting to take the long way round.

37:02 So they're achieving that goal, really, which is just to force shipping to make

37:06 those major diversions. We also have reports that some undersea

37:09 cables may have been damaged in the Red Sea.

37:12 It's very unclear if that's due to Houthi action or perhaps the ship just

37:16 dragging its anchor. But either way, again, how on earth you

37:18 repair undersea cables at the moment in the Red Sea is a very difficult

37:23 question. So, again, further disruption for supply

37:26 chains, possibly for the Internet and so on because of what's been happening in

37:30 the Red Sea. Well, thank you so much, Ross Mathison

37:32 there, head of our news room here in EMEA.

37:35 Now, coming up, evidence that investment is returning to the UK.

37:39 As chief executives tell us they're more optimistic than a year ago.

37:42 Be looking at the bullish case for Britain.

37:44 That's next. And this is Bloomberg.

38:12 Now, the UK's reputation as a global investment destination hit a low last

38:16 April, when Microsoft president Brad Smith said the European Union was a more

38:20 attractive place to start a business. Yet ten months later, 4100 chief

38:24 executives tell us confidence is recovering for all the talk of British

38:28 decline. Official figures actually suggest the UK

38:31 remains the world's top investment destination after the US trumping even

38:35 China or Bloomberg Radio anchor Caroline Habiger has been talking to Britain's

38:39 business elite over the past few months and she joins us now.

38:42 Caroline, there's been some great reporting.

38:43 You've been speaking basically to anyone who's anyone see.

38:47 So what's changed is is sensible Britain back?

38:50 Well, perhaps last year, if you remember, it was pretty dismal for the

38:54 UK. I think we did hit rock bottom in terms

38:57 of sentiment. It wasn't just Brad Smith.

38:59 Lots of other businesses were very critical of the business landscape in

39:02 the UK, from Dyson to AstraZeneca. Listed in the US, if you recall.

39:07 By the end of the year though, the data and sentiment did seem to shift.

39:11 And so Philip Baldrick and I did another sort of deep dive.

39:14 Berenberg Deutsche Bank economists were looking at the silver linings for the UK

39:19 economy and asking whether there's actually a more bullish case to be made

39:23 for the UK. So the WPP chief executive Mark Reid

39:27 saying that actually this year could be one of those years where we feel a

39:30 little bit better as the year progresses.

39:33 We also had a lot of positivity from other CEOs, for example, the CEO of

39:38 British Land, the Legal and General Investment Management CEO Michelle

39:42 Scrimshaw, and also the Lloyd's of London CEO John Neal.

39:46 He was saying that actually the insurance business is looking really

39:50 positive. He was looking to the US where most of

39:52 their growth is saying that there is a big business, that what we do here in

39:57 London is really unique in terms of insurers.

39:59 He was a bit more worried about financial services overall, but even he

40:03 was saying that he does feel much more positive now.

40:06 Have a listen to what he said. Now we've seen a wealth of de-listing on

40:11 the footsie. We've seen real challenges around

40:13 investment funding in the UK. We need to get that back on track.

40:17 You know, part of the livelihood and well-being of UK PLC is as a global

40:22 financial services centre. So that was John Neal, the CEO of

40:28 Lloyd's of London, speaking to me. He was saying that the backdrop is

40:32 better. He was more positive because of the

40:36 government's Mansion House reforms, the Windsor framework when it comes to the

40:39 UK's relationship with the EU. He does also, and this is quite

40:44 important want to see a two term government.

40:46 So there is very much a realisation at the heart of business in the UK that we

40:50 need policy making for the long term. And as Michelle Scrimshaw said,

40:55 something that transcends government in terms of policy making.

40:59 So I wonder whether when you speak to chief executives, whether they think,

41:02 look, actually the UK is a good house in a bad neighborhood because of everything

41:05 that's going around the world or whether they really think there's real progress.

41:09 Yeah, I think that's a big question, isn't it?

41:11 I do think the positives are inflation is coming down.

41:15 There could be an interest rate cut. Wages have been improving for the past

41:19 six months. We've seen wages gain.

41:20 The Marks and Spencers chairman, Archie Norman, who spoke to me last year when

41:24 we did the reporting about Britain being adrift and on investible, came back to

41:28 speak to us at the start of this year and he was saying, look, people are

41:32 genuinely better off. That's better for the customer.

41:36 But also that does signal that actually there may well be recovery.

41:40 Business investment also went up last year and longer term, there is more

41:44 positivity about artificial intelligence.

41:47 Maybe that could deliver big productivity gains for the UK.

41:50 WPP CEO Mark Reid was saying they were already implementing it and it's

41:54 creating 20 to 25% greater productivity for some of their employees.

41:59 Here's what he said about A.I.. I think it's a massive opportunity for

42:04 us. I mean, at one level you could say,

42:06 well, we're large language models, they're all being created in America.

42:09 But actually what you can do with AI is get access to these models extremely

42:15 cheaply because we're a service based economy.

42:18 It could make our service structure much, much more productive, much, much

42:21 more efficient. And I just think we have to lean into it

42:24 and embrace it. So that was the WPP CEO, Mark Reid.

42:31 Look, there is a bit of a disconnect between business people and investors.

42:35 We didn't live pulse survey on investors.

42:37 Almost half of them think that the UK's living standards are going to go down in

42:42 the next five years. Only 17% were positive.

42:45 So there is still a bit of a disconnect, but some more optimism ahead of the

42:49 budget. Caroline, thanks so much.

42:50 Caroline head there from Bloomberg Radio.

42:52 Up next to bloomberg brief Dani Burger and Manus Cranny in new york.

42:56 We have a lot of news. It comes to bitcoin super tuesday, so us
