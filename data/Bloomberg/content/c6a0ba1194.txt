Former Thailand Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra said Pheu Thai, the party he supported in Sunday’s election, won’t back any action that could harm the monarchy after it agreed to participate in a coalition with top opposition group Move Forward.

Speaking in public for the first time since the vote, he heralded the result as a rejection of the military’s “excessive power” despite a second place finish for Pheu Thai following two decades of electoral dominance for Thaksin-backed groups. Still, he distanced his family from Move Forward’s plans to ease rules outlawing criticism of the royal family.
