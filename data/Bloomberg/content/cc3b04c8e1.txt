The US Supreme Court let Idaho enforce a ban on providing gender-transition care for minors, as the justices stepped into a brewing culture-war battle over transgender rights.

Over three dissents, the justices largely put on hold a federal district court ruling that had blocked Idaho from enforcing the law statewide. For now, the ruling will apply only to the two teenage girls who sued to challenge the ban, letting them continue receiving treatment.
