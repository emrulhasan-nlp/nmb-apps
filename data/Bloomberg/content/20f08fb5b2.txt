00:13 >> THE QUESTION OF WHEN WILL IT BECOME APPROPRIATE TO BEGIN

00:16 DIALING BACK IS CLEARLY A DISCUSSED TOPIC.

00:20 >> THE FED SHOWED ITS CARDS HERE.

00:22 THEY ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE FACT INFLATION HAS COME DOWN.

00:28 >> THAT'S BASICALLY AS GOOD AS IT CAN GET.

00:33 >> THIS IS A GREEN LIGHT FOR INVESTORS.

00:39 >> THE MARKET IS TAKING THIS TO THE BRINK AND I WOULD BE

00:41 INCLINED TO GO THE OTHER WAY.

00:46 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE WITH TOM KEENE,

00:49 JONATHAN FERRO AND LISA ABRAMOWICZ. JONATHAN:

00:53 GOOD MORNING, GOOD MORNING FOR OUR AUDIENCE WORLDWIDE THIS IS

00:56 BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE ON TV AND RADIO.

01:00 YOUR EQUITY MARKET POSITIVE AGAIN. THE BOND MARKET IS STILL

01:03 RALLYING.

01:10 WE CLOSED NORTH OF 4700. THAT'S THE YEAR END PRICE

01:14 TARGETED GOLDMAN SACHS FOR NEXT YEAR, NOT THIS YEAR. TOM:

01:19 ON DOW, 37,000. DO WE GET 38,000.

01:25 YESTERDAY THE ARSENAL PLACARD BEHIND GREG PETER'S DESK HAS TO

01:32 STOP. IT WAS TOO EMOTIONAL.

01:36 WHAT I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN IS HOW WE WHAT DO MONEY MARKET

01:41 FUNDS DUE OVER THE COMING DAYS AND WEEKS.

01:43 WHERE DOES THE CASH GO. THE OTHER WAS THE MASSIVE

01:48 OBVIOUS MARGIN CALLS. HOW MANY PEOPLE GOT RUN OVER

01:52 YESTERDAY. THE STORY FOR END OF THE YEAR.

01:59 JONATHAN: ABSOLUTELY STEAMROLLED.

02:01 HERE ARE THE CHANGES. WE NOW FORECAST OF THREE

02:09 CONSECUTIVE 25 BASIS POINT CUTS CONTINUING IN MAY UNTIL JUNE.

02:13 THERE WERE BIG QUESTIONS ABOUT CHAIRMAN POWELL AND WHETHER HE

02:18 WOULD MOVE THE PUNCH BOWL. HE SPIKED IT AND TURNED UP THE

02:19 MUSIC. LISA: IF ANYONE WAS EXPECTING

02:25 PUSHBACK WHAT THEY GOT WAS A DECLARATION OF VICTORY BECAUSE

02:30 WHAT HE SAID WAS NOTHING IN TERMS OF PUSHBACK TO THE

02:33 QUESTION ABOUT FINANCIAL CONDITIONS EASING.

02:37 HE DID NOT SEEM TO ADDRESS IT AT ALL.

02:42 HE DID NOT SEEM WORRIED ABOUT INFLATION ANYMORE AND THE

02:44 RESULT IS THE CHANCES OF A MARCH RATE HIKE WENT FROM LESS

02:49 THAN 40% TO ABOUT 85% LIKE THAT. JONATHAN:

02:52 WHAT CHANGED IN LESS THAN TWO WEEKS.

02:56 HERE'S THE LINE DECEMBER 1, IT WOULD BE PREMATURE TO SPECULATE

02:59 ON WHEN POLICY MIGHT EASE. TWO WEEKS LATER, THE QUESTION

03:05 OF WHEN IT WILL BE APPROPRIATE TO DIAL BACK THE AMOUNT OF

03:07 POLICY RESTRAINT COULD LEAD TO A DISCUSSION AND A DISCUSSION

03:11 FOR US AT OUR MEETING TODAY. LISA: I WILL LET OTHER PEOPLE DO

03:15 CONSPIRACY THEORIES. WHAT I THINK HAPPENED WAS THE

03:20 DATA CAME IN AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE SIX-MONTH TRAILING LEVEL

03:25 INFLATION COMES BELOW THE FED'S TARGET AND AT THE TIME HE

03:28 DOESN'T HAVE THE HEART TO TRY AND HURT THIS ECONOMY IN AN

03:33 EFFORT FOR SOME SORT OF DECLINE IN INFLATION WE ARE ALREADY

03:38 GETTING.

03:40 TOM: TALKING TO A BLOOMBERG WASHINGTON FEDERAL REPORTER

03:44 PRAYED THEY HAVE THREE MEETINGS MAYBE THEY THOUGHT THERE WOULD

03:45 BE TWO MEETINGS. YOU MENTIONED THE PARTY SPIKING

03:49 THE PUNCH BOWL. CHAIRMAN POWELL IS A MASSIVE

03:56 DEBT HEAD -- DEADHEAD AND WAS SINGING TOUCH OF GRAY.

04:01 I'M NOT SAYING I AGREE WITH THAT, BUT I AM SAYING WHAT HE

04:06 DID YESTERDAY FOR VICE CHAIR BIDEN WAS A GIFT. JONATHAN:

04:10 AND YOU START TO CONSIDER THE POLITICAL CALENDAR. TOM:

04:14 WE WILL LET ANNE-MARIE DO THAT. JONATHAN:

04:20 INSTEAD HE'S GOING TO STICK AROUND TO TRY AND ANSWER IT.

04:23 FUTURES ON THE S&P JUST ABOUT POSITIVE.

04:26 YIELDS ARE LOWER BY SEVEN BASIS POINTS.

04:33 YOUR 10 YEAR IS NOW 3.95. THE TWO-YEAR IS DOWN 10 BASIS

04:38 POINTS AGAIN TODAY. THE TWO-YEAR AT ITS PEAK

04:42 OCTOBER 19. WE HAVE DROPPED ALMOST 100

04:47 BASIS POINTS. LISA: CAN WE SIT ON THIS FOR A HALF

04:52 SECOND. THE FACT THAT WE SAW MORE THAN

04:56 A WILL ONE PERCENTAGE POINT DECLINE IN LESS THAN A MONTH,

04:59 SHOULD THAT RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF THE

05:03 MARKET THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE DEEPEST BENCHMARK RATE FOR

05:04 ALL OTHER ASSET CLASSES? JONATHAN:

05:09 WHAT DOES CHAIRMAN POWELL THAT WE DON'T -- WHAT DOES CHAIRMAN

05:12 POWELL KNOW THAT WE DON'T? DO WE HAVE AN ABOUT TURN LIKE

05:17 THE ONE WE SAW, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO ASK WHAT WAS THAT

05:22 ABOUT. WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT.

05:24 LISA: CHRISTINE LAGARDE IS UP NEXT

05:25 AND WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW THAT UP. FOLLOWED BY THAT PRESS

05:30 CONFERENCE WITH CHRISTINE LAGARDE.

05:35 DOES SHE ECHO WHAT WE HEARD FROM FED CHAIR POWELL.

05:39 IT'S BECOME APPARENT WITH THE ECONOMIC DATA THE DISINFLATION

05:40 IS FULLY UNDERWAY.

05:42 LET'S WATCH THIS AND I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THE EURO AND ITS

05:52 RESPONSE.

05:53 NOVEMBER RETAIL SALES WILL BE IMPORTANT.

05:57 TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT WHAT THE FED KNOWS THAT WE DON'T.

06:04 FED CHAIR POWELL DID NOT REALLY ENGAGE IN MUCH POTENTIAL

06:06 PUSHBACK TO ANYTHING HE WAS PUTTING OUT THERE.

06:11 IF WE START TO SEE A REAL DETERIORATION IN RETAIL SALES

06:13 DOES THAT POINT TO SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

06:16 WOULD YOU LIKE TO CONTINUE? TOM: A NOMINAL STATISTIC, DAVID

06:24 ROSENBERG IN THE LAST HOUR TWEETED OUT ABOUT THE FOCUS ON

06:26 NOMINAL GDP. DID HE KNOW THOSE NUMBERS

06:28 YESTERDAY? I DO NOT KNOW. LISA:

06:34 I THINK THE EARNINGS OF A LOT OF COMPANIES ARE INTERESTING.

06:38 WE TALK ABOUT MAGNIFICENT SEVEN BUT COSTCO SHARES HER UP.

06:44 LENNAR UP AS WELL. JONATHAN:

06:51 JOINING US IS THE INTERNATIONAL CIO WITHIN THE GLOBAL FIXED

06:54 INCOME CURRENCY COMMITTEE GROUP AT J.P. MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT.

06:59 WHAT CHANGED FOR THE FED CHAIR IN TWO WEEKS?

07:00 WHAT CHANGED FOR YOU?

07:05 >> I THINK JEROME POWELL IS FIXATED ON DELIVERING THE SOFT

07:09 LANDING AND WHAT'S CHANGED IS THE INFLATION DATA IS COMING

07:15 DOWN. WE ARE SEEING GOOD EVIDENCE

07:18 THAT JOB IS DONE AND THEY ARE WORRIED THEY ARE IN RESTRICTIVE

07:19 TERRITORY. WHAT HE WAS PROBABLY DOING WAS

07:24 MAKING SURE THAT THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE WOULD BE ON BOARD

07:30 WITH WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO YESTERDAY WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY DO

07:33 THE PIVOT AND GET THE MARKETS EXCITED ABOUT THAT.

07:36 WE HAVE DEFINITELY SHIFTED FROM WHERE WE WERE EARLY IN THE YEAR

07:41 WHERE PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT GROWTH SLOWING AND

07:43 INFLATION BEING TOO HIGH. CENTRAL BANKS CAN NOW BE

07:48 PROACTIVE AND TRIED TO DELIVER THIS SOFT LANDING. JONATHAN:

07:53 THINKING ABOUT RATE CUTS, WHEN

07:59 DO YOU THINK WE CUT FIRST. IAIN: I STILL THINK IT WILL BE

08:01 DEPENDENT ON THE DATA AND THEY WILL BE LOOKING TO KEEP RATES

08:07 HIGHER UNTIL THEY ARE FULLY COMMITTED TO HAVING INFLATION

08:12 COMING DOWN BUT IF THE DATA CONTINUES TO WEAKEN AND WE SEE

08:14 THOSE GOING DOWN THERE'S NO REASON TO BE CUTTING.

08:20 IF YOU THINK ABOUT HISTORICAL CYCLES FROM FINAL HIKE TO FIRST

08:26 CUT, IT IS NOT TYPICALLY -- THE FINAL HIKE WAS IN JULY THAN

08:28 ACTUALLY MARCH DOESN'T SEEM UNREASONABLE. TOM:

08:35 THE WEEKLY PROSPECTS WE WILL GET FRIDAY ARE WIDELY

08:36 ANTICIPATED. 4.32% AND 11 BASIS POINTS.

08:46 I GOT THE REAL YIELD DOWN TO A 1.76 ON THE 10 YEAR REAL YIELD.

08:53 WHAT HAPPENS IN YOUR WORLD WHEN THE MONEY MARKET FUND COMES

08:55 DOWN. I'VE GOT A QUOTE FROM BLACK

08:57 ROCK. 5.42%.

09:04 WHAT HAPPENS IN A 4.50 MONEY MARKET FUND.

09:07 WHERE IS THAT ALLOCATED ACROSS THE JP MORGAN WORLD? IAIN:

09:10 THE BOND MARKET. WHAT WE HAD YESTERDAY WAS

09:15 PROBABLY THE GREEN LIGHT. I'VE BEEN SPEAKING TO INVESTORS

09:18 OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS AND THEY HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED BONDS

09:22 LOOK ATTRACTIVE, A GROWTH HAS SLOWED BUT WHAT THEY WANTED TO

09:25 SEE WAS THE PIVOT FROM THE FED. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

09:29 FRUSTRATED FOR THE FIRST PART OF THIS YEAR AND THEY WERE

09:34 STILL CONCERNED THEY HAD A TIGHTENING BIAS.

09:36 THAT IS GONE AND THE NEXT MOVE IS CUTS.

09:43 >> DOES IT KEEP GOING FROM HERE? OR FROM WHAT WE HEARD FROM GREG

09:49 PETERS YESTERDAY, MAKING IT REAL CLEAR HE DOES NOT BY THIS

09:51 HE IS LOOKING FOR A PULLBACK. TO STEP IN.

09:58 THAT'S THE CONUNDRUM THIS WEEKEND FOR FIXED INCOME. LISA:

10:03 WHICH IS THE REASON IT'S INTERESTING YOU SEEM TO HAVE

10:04 MORE THE CONVICTION IT WILL GO INTO BONDS.

10:08 ARE YOU SAYING THE LONG END IS DUTCH GIVEN THE PIVOT FROM THE

10:09 FED.

10:14 >> FIRSTLY THE PULLBACK WOULD BE GREAT.

10:16 EVERYONE WAS LOOKING FOR THAT THIS WEEK.

10:20 WE WERE APPARENTLY GOING TO HAVE A FED THAT WOULD PUSHBACK

10:23 ON THE EASING OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS.

10:27 ARE WE CAN GET THAT PULLBACK OR DO YOU JUST NEED TO LOOK AT THE

10:30 BOND MARKET TODAY AND SAY THAT'S NOT TOO BAD.

10:33 MOST PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BOUGHT THAT AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS

10:35 YEAR AND THE DATA IS SLOWING.

10:42 WHERE ON THE CURVE, THE SUPPLY THAT'S COMING.

10:47 MORE INTERMEDIATE BONDS FROM A RISK REWARD STANDPOINT.

10:50 WE ARE IN AN ENVIRONMENT WE SHOULD BE PRETTY GOOD FOR THE

10:55 BOND MARKET.

10:56 >> EVERYBODY WAS SET UP WITH THE ECB MAKING THE FIRST RATE

10:59 CUT AND THE FED FOLLOWING BECAUSE THE U.S.

11:00 ECONOMY WAS IN A BETTER POSITION.

11:03 WE ARE SEEING THAT IN CURRENCY MARKETS WITH THE EURO.

11:08 I'M WONDERING IF THIS IS THE MOST OUT OF CONSENSUS TRADE YOU

11:10 CAN LEAN INTO. THAT THE DOLLAR WILL WEAKEN AND

11:16 THE EURO WILL STRENGTHEN WITH THE FED BEING MUCH MORE

11:21 AGGRESSIVE ON THIS OR PERHAPS JUST POWELL AND THE FED CHAIR.

11:23 I'M JUST CRUSHING IT. IAIN: IT'S GOING TO BE FASCINATING

11:28 HOW LAGARDE FOLLOWS THIS.

11:34 IF YOU JUST LOOKED AT BOTH OF THOSE MARKETS AND YOU LOOK AT

11:37 THE EURO ZONE WHERE GROWTH IS ZERO.

11:42 WE HAVE HAD THIS DISINFLATION ENVIRONMENT IN EUROPE WHICH IS

11:44 BECOMING QUITE CONCERNING. IT'S THE ECB THAT SHOULD BE

11:49 DOING THIS SORT OF PIVOT, NOT THE FED.

11:53 I WILL BE FASCINATED TO SEE WHAT LAGARDE HAS TO SAY.

11:59 JONATHAN: YOUR TURN, YOU ARE NEXT.

12:03 >> THE ECB TYPICALLY TAKES MORE TIME TO MOVE TO MAINTAIN THAT

12:07 CONSENSUS BUT IT COULD ALSO BE THERE FOR THE ECB SO I'LL BE

12:10 INTERESTED TO SEE IF THEY FOLLOW POWELL.

12:13 AND IF THEY DO THE MARKET WILL BE OFF TO THE RACES. TOM:

12:18 THE MONEY YOU MENTIONED EARLIER GOING TO FIXED INCOME, DOES IT

12:21 ALSO GO TO EQUITY AND IS THE MARKET GETTING OUT FRONT OF THE

12:26 WALL OF MONEY IN MAY, JUNE OR JULY.

12:30 >> IF THE MARKET CAN GET CONVINCED THEY WILL DELIVER THE

12:31 SOFT LANDING.

12:33 >> WITH AMPLE GDP. DO YOU SEE IN THE GDP FORECAST

12:38 YESTERDAY.

12:45 >> YOU ARE SEEING TREND LIKE GDP , IT IS COMING DOWN BUT

12:48 IT'S NOT DISASTROUS AND IF THEY GENERATE THE SOFT LANDING AND

12:53 WE START TO MOVE BACK UP AGAIN, THAT WILL SUPPORT ALL ASSET

12:56 CLASSES.

12:57 >> JUST HOW DATA DEPENDENT IS THIS RATE CUT.

13:01 I WONDER HOW DATA DEPENDENT IT IS BASED ON COMMUNICATION WE

13:02 SAW YESTERDAY. WHAT WOULD NEED TO HAPPEN TO

13:06 MAKE THIS GO THROUGH? IAIN: CONTINUED EVIDENCE THAT

13:10 INFLATION IS SLOWING. THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE OF

13:14 THE SAME AND I DO THINK YOU WANT TO SEE A LITTLE BIT IN THE

13:19 JOB MARKET BUT WE ALSO HEARD OF THOSE INSURANCE COMPANIES --

13:26 INSURANCE CUTS IT MIGHT BE INFLATION DEPENDENT.

13:28 THEY DO BELIEVE THEY ARE IN VERY RESTRICTIVE TERRITORY AT

13:34 THE MOMENT.

13:36 JONATHAN: DOWN ANOTHER SEVEN BASIS POINTS.

13:40 THE FED BEHIND US, THE ECB STILL HAD FOR THE EUROPEAN

13:46 CENTRAL BANK IS THE DOOR WIDE OPEN FOR LAGARDE TO DO EXACTLY

13:47 WHAT CHAIRMAN POWELL DID YESTERDAY.

13:49 >> I THINK SHE HAS A WHOLE DIFFERENT SET OF PEOPLE AROUND

13:55 THE TABLE. I CAN'T BELIEVE ANYBODY COULD

13:58 DO THAT. YESTERDAY HE COULD DO IT

14:04 BECAUSE HE HAS A VIBRANT DYNAMIC TECHNOLOGY DRIVEN

14:08 ECONOMY AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, EUROPE AND JAPAN DON'T HAVE

14:11 THAT. LISA: THEY HAVE MORE REASON TO GO

14:19 FIRST. >> THEY ARE NOT GOING TO CUT RATES TODAY. JONATHAN:

14:23 THE ECB LATER, THE BANK OF ENGLAND AS WELL.

14:28 TALKING TO A MAN WHO HAS NAILED IT OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS.

14:45 >> A HUGE ABOUT TURN FROM CHAIRMAN POWELL YESTERDAY

14:49 SPARKING A BIG CONTINUATION IN THIS RALLY.

14:56 FUTURES POSITIVE BY .3% ON THE S&P 500.

15:00 THE RALLY CONTINUES IN THE BOND MARKET.

15:04 WE'VE DROPPED AND BROKEN 4%.

15:10 >> TERRIFIC ANALYSIS, THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENTS YESTERDAY.

15:17 WE SLEEP HERE, WE DON'T GO TO A HOTEL OR ANYTHING.

15:21 JUST GREAT COMMENTS THROUGH THE EVENING AS WE MADE A CAMPFIRE.

15:25 JONATHAN: CARRY ON. LISA: IT'S AN AMERICAN THING.

15:30 JONATHAN: I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE RELEVANCE OF IT. TOM:

15:35 HERE IS THE RELEVANCE RIGHT NOW FROM NEW YORK WALL STREET.

15:39 A NUMBER OF ANALYSTS HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB ON THIS.

15:44 MICROSOFT IS A MAGNIFICENT SEVEN CHARGES TODAY.

15:50 HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY AFTERNOON AS A LOT OF PEOPLE

15:53 GOT RUN OVER BY JEROME POWELL ON THE TRADE.

16:00 COMING OUT WITH A BIG BIOCIDE CALL. HERE ON TELEVISION.

16:08 THROUGH THE DAY, POWELL SPOKE IN THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN

16:15 CRATERED.

16:16 THEY CRATERED BECAUSE WHEN YOU ARE IN STRESS AND HAVE MARGIN

16:22 CALLS YOU SELL THE BEST QUALITY THING. IT HAPPENS EVERY TIME.

16:27 WOULD WE SAW YESTERDAY WITH THE REBOUND AFTER THE CALLS CAME IN

16:30 I THINK IS PROFOUNDLY IMPORTANT. FASCINATING TO SEE WHAT THEY DO

16:32 TODAY.

16:37 >> I THINK WHAT'S MORE CURIOUS OVER THE LAST MONTH IS THAT

16:39 BRENT HAS IMPROVED. WHAT WE SAW WAS A CONTINUATION

16:43 OF THE BOND MARKET RALLY.

16:49 THE REGIONALS UP BY MORE THAN FIVE.

16:52 THAT'S WHERE THE ENTHUSIASM IS OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS.

16:58 MUCH MORE OPTIMISTIC CONSTRUCTIVE ABOUT THE

16:59 PROSPECTS FOR GROWTH.

17:03 >> THE RUSSELL 2000 UP YESTERDAY.

17:07 LOOKING AT IS THIS THE WAY PEOPLE ARE SELLING WHAT THEY

17:11 CAN TO BUY THINGS THAT HAVE UPSIDE POTENTIAL. JONATHAN:

17:18 -- TOM: ANNMARIE HORDERN WITH US THIS

17:21 MORNING. I HAVE A LOT OF POLITICAL

17:28 QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FED. A BLOOMBERG POLL THIS MORNING.

17:33 WHAT IS NEW ABOUT THE POLLS IN JANUARY. ANNMARIE:

17:39 THE FIRST TIME TRUMP HAS A LEAD AHEAD OF BIDEN IN CHICAGO -- IN

17:40 MICHIGAN. HE NOW HAS THE SEVEN SWING

17:45 STATES THAT WE HAVE BEEN POLLING PRAYED IN OCTOBER BIDEN

17:49 STILL HAD MICHIGAN AND NOW THAT GOES TO TRUMP TRADE IT'S STILL

17:54 WITHIN THE MARGIN OF ERROR BUT BIDEN IS LOSING SUPPORT FROM

17:55 THESE GROUPS HE HAS TO WIN. TALKING ABOUT BLACK AMERICANS,

17:59 YOUNG AMERICANS AND WOMEN VOTERS. WHAT YOU WILL SEE IS

18:04 POTENTIALLY THE FACT BIDEN COULD BUILD ON THIS.

18:07 IT'S ABOUT BRINGING BACK IN THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR HIM IN

18:10 2020. IT LOOKS GOOD FOR THE FORMER

18:12 PRESIDENT. ON THE ECONOMY, PEOPLE TRUST

18:20 TRUMP WHEN IT COMES TO EVERYTHING, AND NOT JUST

18:21 KITCHEN TABLE ISSUES THAT INTEREST RATES.

18:24 THEY TRUST THE FORMER PRESIDENT. THERE WAS ONE PIECE OF DATA I

18:28 THINK IS VERY GOOD FOR THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN AND THAT IS THE

18:32 FACT THAT WHILE MOST SWING STATE VOTERS DON'T THINK THE

18:37 ECONOMY HAS MOVED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION , THEY HAVE BETTER

18:40 MORE OPTIMISTIC PROGRESS ABOUT HOW THEIR OWN ECONOMIC

18:41 CONDITIONS ARE. WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THEIR TOWN

18:45 OR COUNTY AND THAT IS SOMETHING THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN COULD BUILD

18:50 ON.

18:51 >> A SERIES OF BAD POLLS FOR THIS PRESIDENT.

18:54 THIS WHITE HOUSE CLAIMS THEY DON'T REALLY LISTEN TO THE

18:55 POLLS OR FOLLOW THEM. WHAT I'M CAPTURING IS A SHIFT

19:01 FROM THIS ADMINISTRATION. THE SECRETARY OF TREASURY DOING

19:08 THE SAME THING EARLIER THIS WEEK , A SHIFT WHEN IT COMES TO

19:11 VIEWS ON ISRAEL AND THE DIVISION THAT'S HAPPENING

19:12 PRIVATELY. THEY MIGHT CLAIM THESE POLLS

19:18 DON'T MATTER BUT ARE THESE CHANGING POLICY? ANNMARIE:

19:23 POLITICO SAYING THE VICE PRESIDENT IS URGING THE

19:26 ADMINISTRATION EVEN HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH PRESIDENT

19:30 BIDEN ABOUT THE MESSAGING AND CONVERSATION THAT NEEDS TO BE

19:34 HAPPENING WITH THE PRIME MINISTER ABOUT DAY TWO.

19:38 WHAT HAPPENS NEXT AFTER THE ISRAELI INVASION OF GAZA.

19:43 THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE HUMANITARIAN SO WE HAVE SEEN A

19:46 SHIFT WHEN IT COMES TO HOW THIS ADMINISTRATION IS TALKING ABOUT

19:51 ISRAEL BUT ALSO TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMY, BIDEN'S COAT ON

19:54 FRIDAY WAS THIS, SOLID STEADY JOB GROWTH.

19:58 A SWEET SPOT NEEDED FOR STABLE GROWTH AND LOW INFLATION.

20:02 NOT ENCOURAGING THE FED TO RAISE INTEREST RATES.

20:05 THIS WAS A VERY RARE FOR THE PRESIDENT TO DO THIS.

20:13 WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW IN 1992 WHEN GEORGE BUSH LOST

20:15 REELECTION HE SQUARELY BLAMED ALAN GREENSPAN FOR THAT.

20:16 HE SAID PEOPLE WEREN'T FEELING THE RECOVERY BECAUSE HE WAS TOO

20:19 LATE. HE SAID I APPOINTED HIM AND HE

20:22 DISAPPOINTED ME. LISA: DOES ANYONE BELIEVE THE FED

20:29 CHAIR WOULD SOMEHOW MANIPULATE HER CONVINCED TO SHIFT HIS

20:32 APPROACH BECAUSE OF THE ADMINISTRATION?

20:36 >> I'M NOT GOING TO SPEAK FOR WHAT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT WHAT I

20:40 WILL SAY IS A TRIFECTA OF EVERYONE SINGING FROM THE SAME

20:44 TUNE STARTING ON FRIDAY WITH THE PRESIDENT TALKING ABOUT HOW

20:48 WE ARE IN A SWEET SPOT. THIS ADMINISTRATION LOVES TO

20:53 TELL THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS BEEN UNDER 4% FOR SOME 22

20:59 MONTHS. THE SECRETARY SAYING SHE THINKS

21:02 THE FED IS ON THE RIGHT PATH AND IT FELT LIKE FROM JAY

21:06 POWELL YESTERDAY A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TONE HE TOOK THAN TWO

21:08 WEEKS PRIOR. THAT IS FOR CUTS NEXT YEAR.

21:15 SO THE TIMELINE FOR THE BIDEN CAMP AT THIS MOMENT WHEN IT

21:17 COMES TO THE ECONOMY IS VERY STRONG.

21:21 THAT REMAINS THE ISSUE HE IS DRAGGING IN THE POLLS BUT THEY

21:23 HAVE 11 MONTHS. LISA:

21:25 THERE ALSO HAS BEEN SOME NEW DATA THAT'S BEEN PARTICULARLY

21:32 DISINFLATIONARY. I'M CURIOUS ABOUT PRESIDENT

21:36 BIDEN'S SUPPORT ON THE LEFT NOT ONLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE

21:40 ISRAEL HAMAS WAR BUT ALSO WITH UKRAINE GIVEN THE FACT THERE

21:44 SEEMS TO BE A GREATER WILLINGNESS TO GIVE INTO

21:46 CERTAIN REPUBLICAN DEMANDS FOR BORDER CONTROL POLICY.

21:48 THIS IS ANGERING A LOT OF PEOPLE.

21:52 HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK YOU WILL GO THROUGH WITH THAT EVEN IF IT

21:53 ALIENATES MEMBERS OF THE PARTY?

21:55 >> THERE WILL HAVE TO BE A BORDER DEAL IF THEY WANT AID

22:01 FOR UKRAINE. EVEN THE MOST CRITICAL DEFENSE

22:04 HAWKS LIKE LINDSEY GRAHAM SAYING IN ORDER TO GET UKRAINE

22:06 THAT MONEY THERE HAS TO BE A BORDER DEAL.

22:09 I'M NOT SURE BIDEN DOESN'T WANT TO BORDER DEAL.

22:13 HE HAS TO MAKE SURE HE'S LISTENING TO THE PROGRESSIVES

22:16 BUT AT THE SAME TIME IMMIGRATION CONCERNS OF THE

22:20 BORDER ALSO RANK HIGH IN THEIR POLLING OF WHAT SWING STATE

22:25 VOTERS CARE ABOUT.

22:27 >> YOU MENTIONED THE POLITICO STORY ON THE VICE PRESIDENT

22:29 URGING THE WHITE HOUSE TO BE MORE SYMPATHETIC TO

22:34 PALESTINIANS. WHERE IS THAT COMING FROM?

22:38 WHO -- IN WHOSE INTEREST IS THAT STORY TO COME OUT?

22:40 ANNMARIE: PARTLY IN KAMALA HARRIS'S

22:45 INTEREST. SHE'S POTENTIALLY WAVING THE FLAG WITHIN THE

22:51 ADMINISTRATION ALSO LAST NIGHT SOME MEMBERS OF THE STAFF,

22:56 WHETHER THIS IS THE EXECUTIVE OFFICE BUILDING, BUT STAFFERS

23:00 TO THIS ADMINISTRATION WERE OUTSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE

23:03 PROTESTING PRESIDENT BIDEN'S POLICY WHEN IT COMES TO ISRAEL.

23:07 PEOPLE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION, PROGRESSIVES ON THE LEFT THINK

23:12 THEY HAVE GONE TOO FAR WHEN YOU SEE THE PALESTINIAN DEATH TOLL

23:13 NORTH OF 17,000 PEOPLE.

23:18 >> WE HAVE A SENSE THERE WAS DIVISION PRIVATELY.

23:23 NOW STARTING TO SEE THAT PUBLICLY IN A MORE MATERIAL WAY.

23:28 TOM: THE POLITICAL REALITY OF THE

23:33 FED BABBLE OF YESTERDAY, THE SHOCK OF IT IN THE LATEST

23:35 SHOWING. WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE ELITES

23:40 AND PEOPLE WITH ASSETS WHICH IS A SMALLER PART OF AMERICA.

23:44 THE ANSWER IS ON THE OTHERS IF IT TO GET ELECTED IS THE AGONY

23:46 OF INFLATION. THE NEW INFLATION TO COME.

23:52 THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT.

23:59 IT IS A DOZEN EGGS POPPING BACK TO FIVE DOLLARS.

24:03 >> THANK YOU YOU. THROUGHOUT THE MORNING ON

24:07 BLOOMBERG TV AND ON RADIO.

24:13 RENAISSANCE MACRO AND WHY HE'S BEEN SO RIGHT ALL YEAR.

24:15 NEIL WILL JOIN US IN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES TIME.

24:20 COME TELL US WHY YOU'VE BEEN SO RIGHT.

24:22 HE WILL TELL US IN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES TIME. GOOD MORNING.

24:26 EQUITY FUTURES POSITIVE AGAIN. THE RALLY CONTINUES.

24:28 THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

24:47 JONATHAN: POURING FUEL ON THE FIRE.

24:50 FOLLOWING THAT FED DECISION AT THE CHAIR POWELL NEWS

24:54 CONFERENCE. EQUITY FUTURES OF THE S&P 500

24:58 POSITIVE BY .25%. HIGHER ON THE S&P 500.

25:05 YEAR-TO-DATE THE GAINS MORE THAN 20% ON THE S&P.

25:09 YEAR-TO-DATE THE GAINS OF 40% ON THE NASDAQ.

25:12 >> HOW MUCH MORE FUEL IS THERE TO BURN TO PUSH THESE TO NEW

25:17 HEIGHTS. ALREADY BEFORE NEXT YEAR

25:18 HAPPENS.

25:19 THEY SAY WE HAVE ALREADY HIT THOSE TARGETS WE SEE NO REASON

25:26 FOR THEM TO GO DOWN. THIS WAS A MASSIVE SHIFT THAT

25:31 IS SCREAMING ACROSS MARKETS AND CHANGES SOME OF THE EQUATION

25:35 GOING FORWARD.

25:36 >> LET'S GO THROUGH THE BOND MARKET TOGETHER.

25:38 TO YEAR AND 10 YEAR.

25:46 THE TWO YEAR ON OCTOBER 19 WAS 5.25" 71.

25:54 ON THE 10 YEAR FOR OCTOBER 23, WE ARE DOWN TO 3.9469 AND DOWN

25:57 ANOTHER SEVEN BASIS POINTS.

26:02 >> YESTERDAY WAS THE BIGGEST RALLY OF THE BOND MARKET SINCE

26:04 PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT A BANKING SYSTEM COLLAPSED.

26:08 THERE IS A QUESTION OF WHETHER THEY HAVE GONE TOO FAR OR NOT

26:11 FAR ENOUGH AND WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN FED FUNDS FUTURES IS

26:15 150 BASIS POINTS OF RATE CUTS PRICED INTO THE MARKET FOR NEXT

26:16 YEAR. THAT'S SIX RATE CUTS.

26:22 THEY SAY THREE AND THE MARKET SAYS WE WILL SEE THAT AN AA.

26:27 JAY POWELL DID NOTHING BUT TO UNDERSCORE THAT WAS A

26:30 PROBABILITY AND SAYING HERE WE ARE WE DID THAT.

26:34 >> LET'S PUSH THIS THROUGH THE FX MARKET.

26:38 THE EURO BEGETS THE DOLLAR. THE ECB COMING UP LATER.

26:44 THE TOP STORY, THE FEDERAL RESERVE GETTING READY TO

26:47 REVERSE THE STEEPEST RATE HIKES IN A GENERATION FOR A SERIES OF

26:50 CUTS NEXT YEAR.

26:55 >> THE QUESTION OF WHEN WILL THIS BECOME APPROPRIATE TO

26:57 BEGIN DIALING BACK THE POLICY RESTRAINT IN PLACE.

27:00 THAT BEGINS TO COME INTO VIEW AND IS CLEARLY A TOPIC OF

27:05 DISCUSSION. ALSO FOR US AT OUR MEETING

27:07 TODAY.

27:10 >> PREMATURE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION.

27:14 TWO WEEKS LATER THERE WAS A TOPIC OF DISCUSSION.

27:18 >> THEY HAVE SEEN THE DATA AND I WILL SAY IT AGAIN A FIRST

27:23 LOOK AT RETAIL SALES THIS MORNING AND IT COMES IN A

27:25 LITTLE BIT LIGHT THAT GETS IN THE COVER HE NEEDS TO DO IN

27:29 DECEMBER WHAT POSSIBLY HE WAS GOING TO DO IN MARCH. JONATHAN:

27:34 TK WITH SOME CONSPIRACY THEORIES.

27:37 >> I GREW UP IN A HOUSE WHERE THIS WAS FRONT AND CENTER.

27:41 SPENT ALL DAY WORRIED ABOUT CONSPIRACY THEORIES.

27:44 IT'S OUT THERE, PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT.

27:46 WE DON'T HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT. SOME PEOPLE THINK THERE IS VICE

27:49 BIDEN.

27:54 >> A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IDEOLOGICAL FEDERAL RESERVE

27:58 CHAIR AND ONE THAT IS MUCH MORE PRACTICAL AND A PRAGMATIST WHO

28:02 DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH OF AN ACADEMIC BACKGROUND AND THERE

28:05 IS A FEELING HE HASN'T HAD A DRIVING THEORY.

28:07 SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS THAT HE IS FOLLOWING.

28:10 LET ME GUESS, YOU AGREE.

28:12 >> I DO NOT. HE HAD A PURPLE TIE ON.

28:16 WEARING A PURPLE TIE YESTERDAY. HE IS IN THE MIDDLE.

28:20 >> WAVING IN THE WIND. IF THAT HELPS.

28:28 >> DOES GOVERNOR BAILEY PLAY TO THE TORIES AND LABOR.

28:32 >> TRIES NOT TO. THEY ARE MEANT TO BE

28:34 INDEPENDENT.

28:43 LET'S GET TO THE TOP STORY DOWN IN WASHINGTON DC.

28:44 HOUSE REPUBLICANS VOTING TO AUTHORIZE AN IMPEACHMENT

28:45 INQUIRY INTO PRESIDENT BIDEN.

28:47 IT DOES NOT SET A DEADLINE OR LAYOUT ANY SPECIFIC IMPEACHABLE

28:54 OFFENSES. IT SET UP A HIGH PROFILE CLASH

28:57 BETWEEN CONGRESS AND THE WHITE HOUSE AS THE 2024 ELECTION

29:02 APPROACHES. LISA: THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS

29:05 OVER HOW MUCH COHESIVENESS AND CONVICTION BY REPUBLICANS

29:10 AGAINST PRESIDENT BIDEN TO ACTUALLY IMPEACH HIM BECAUSE

29:13 YOU HAVE REPUBLICANS FROM SWING STATE SAYING WE DON'T WANT TO

29:16 PUSH BACK AGAINST YOU BUT IT LOOKS BAD FOR US TO GET BEHIND

29:17 SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE MUCH EVIDENCE.

29:21 HOW MUCH OF A STUNT IS THIS AND HOW MUCH CAN YOU GET SOME

29:23 COALESCING BEHIND THIS.

29:29 >> LITTLE REED CALL IMPEACHMENT. IT'S A TOUR DE FORCE, DOESN'T

29:37 MATTER REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT, THE PASTEURIZATION OF THIS

29:38 PROCESS IS A TRAVESTY. JONATHAN: DON'T HOLD BACK THIS MORNING.

29:48 TOM: IT DOESN'T MATTER IF REPUBLICAN

29:51 OR DEMOCRAT, CLEARS THE AIR. JONATHAN:

29:56 UBS STEPPING UP EFFORTS TO CLAW BACK HUNDREDS OF CASH BONUSES

29:59 FROM CREDIT SUISSE DEALMAKERS BEFORE THE BANKS COLLAPSE.

30:03 THE WAS LENDER CONTACTING HUNDREDS OF LENDERS TRYING TO

30:07 RECOUP A CHUNK OF THE CASH REWARDS ACCORDING TO PEOPLE

30:11 FAMILIAR WITH THE MATTER.

30:13 CAN YOU IMAGINE RIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS THEY ASK FOR THE

30:17 BONUS PACK. WHAT ON EARTH.

30:19 >> I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY. IT'S JUST TOO ME THE ODDEST

30:23 THING. AUTHORITIES IN SWITZERLAND

30:27 SAYING YOU ARE RIGHT, GO GET IT. LISA:

30:30 THERE ARE CLAWBACK PROVISIONS FOR PEOPLE WHO LEAVE, IT'S JUST

30:35 NEVER BEEN EXECUTED ON A MASS SCALE PARTICULARLY WITH AT A

30:41 TIME WHEN UBS SHARES ARE UP SINCE THE ACQUISITION.

30:48 POISED FOR THE BIGGEST GAIN IN UBS ANNUAL STOCK RETURN HISTORY

30:51 BACK TO 1997. JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF

30:52 WHERE THEY ARE AT. THEY WILL EAT OUT EVERY LAST

30:57 DOLLAR.

31:02 >> A GREAT GUEST COMING UP BUT WE TALK ABOUT MERGERS,

31:05 ACQUISITIONS AND CULTURE CLASHES , THE CULTURE CLASH

31:06 HERE IS POISON. SOME OF THE STORIES COMING OUT.

31:11 >> MUCH MORE WITH A LOT OF REPORTING FROM MANUS CRANNY AS

31:17 WELL. I THINK THERE'S A MAJOR CULTURE

31:21 CLASH AND A DOMESTIC FEAR MAYBE WE DON'T SEE IN OUR PRESS.

31:25 YESTERDAY HUMILITY FOR EVERYONE. LISA: EXCEPT.

31:33 >> TODAY A RECALIBRATION OF WHERE WE GO IN OUR OPTIMISM OF

31:35 THE AMERICAN EXPERIMENT.

31:41 HEAD OF ECONOMICS AT RENAISSANCE MACRO OVER THE LAST

31:45 18 MONTHS AND ABSOLUTE TOUR DE FORCE THAT AMERICA ECONOMIC

31:50 MIGHT WILL PREVAIL. DAVID ROSENBERG WRITES OF A

31:53 TEPID NOMINAL GDP. AT THE SAME TIME DAN IVES AND

31:59 JOEL FISHBEIN AT THE TRUEST GO BACK TO AND THREE YEARS ON

32:02 TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE. CAN OUR TECHNOLOGY LEAD

32:08 CONTINUE THE OPTIMISM ON THE AMERICAN ECONOMY?

32:10 >> THAT'S A TOUGH QUESTION. I HOPE SO.

32:15 PRODUCTIVITY IS NOTORIOUSLY DIFFICULT TO PROCESS.

32:23 IT RAISES THE CAPACITY FOR THE ECONOMY TO GROW WITHOUT STOKING

32:26 INFLATION WHICH TAKES A LOT OF PRESSURE OFF THE FED.

32:29 >> THE LAST FEW MONTHS YOU HAVE BEEN LOCKED IN.

32:33 SOME OTHER PEOPLE ARE LACKING. WHAT'S THE FRAMEWORK YOU ARE

32:36 USED TO SEEING THINGS A BIT MORE CLEARLY OVER THE LAST FEW

32:37 MONTHS.

32:38 >> YOU MENTIONED EARLIER POWELL SOUNDED DIFFERENT A COUPLE

32:44 WEEKS AGO. TO ME THE DIE HAS BEEN CAST FOR

32:49 THIS FOR A LITTLE BIT OF TIME NOW. THAT'S BECAUSE INFLATION IS

32:53 SLOWING MORE RAPIDLY THAN EXPECTED.

32:58 I THINK THE FED IS FOLLOWING A RULES-BASED FRAMEWORK WHERE

33:03 THEY ARE TAKING CHANGES IN INFLATION AND TRANSLATING THAT

33:06 TO EXPECTATIONS AROUND THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE.

33:09 THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING AND WHAT THEY DID

33:14 YESTERDAY. SO CORE INFLATION IN NOVEMBER

33:16 IS LIKELY TO COME IN BARELY 1/10 OF 1% MONTH OVER MONTH AND

33:24 THAT MEANS THE MOMENTUM GOING INTO 2024 IS QUITE WEAK.

33:29 SO IF THEY ARE REVISING DOWN INFLATION IN DECEMBER WHICH

33:32 THEY DID AND THEN A FEW MONTHS LATER THEY WILL BE REVISING

33:35 DOWN INFLATION IN MARCH. I -- WHAT DO YOU EXPECT THEM TO

33:37 DO. WHAT I WOULD PUSH BACK IS THE

33:42 NOTION THAT THIS IS -- YOU SEE THIS ALREADY.

33:45 THE 10-YEAR IS BELOW 4%. THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

33:52 THIS IS ABOUT INFLATION COMING IN BETTER AND THE FED ADJUSTING

33:56 AS A RESULT AND THAT'S ULTIMATELY A GOOD THING.

34:01 I THINK IT'S GOING TO GIVE THE ECONOMY A CHANCE TO CONTINUE

34:06 GROWING AND I THINK THAT'S LIKELY.

34:09 >> POLICYMAKERS LIKE TO USE THE WORD IF JUST TO HEDGE

34:14 THEMSELVES. YOU DON'T THINK -- YOU THINK

34:17 THIS IS ALREADY -- THE RATE CUTS ARE COMING.

34:24 >> TO ME, SIX FEELS LIKE IF THERE'S A RECESSION SIX

34:25 WOULDN'T BE ENOUGH BUT IF THE ECONOMY IS GOING SIX FEELS LIKE

34:27 TOO MANY. I DON'T THINK IT'S MUCH OF AN F

34:32 ABOUT INFLATION. POWELL TALKED EARLIER ABOUT A

34:35 DISINFLATIONARY PROCESS AND I THINK THAT WAS PREMATURE TO

34:37 TALK ABOUT. NOW IT DOES FEEL LIKE A

34:42 MEANINGFUL DISINFLATIONARY PROCESS IS UNDERWAY AND WE HAVE

34:46 CONTINUED MODERATION AND HOUSING RENTAL INFLATION.

34:52 THE TERMINAL HAS AN ARTICLE TODAY GOING DOWN YEAR-OVER-YEAR.

34:55 THEY WILL CONTINUE TO DEFLATE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS

35:00 AND THAT POPPED IN NOVEMBER. BETWEEN THAT AND CORE GOODS

35:05 EXCLUDING THERE'S CONTINUE DOWNSIDE THERE AS WELL SO --

35:10 AND THE LABOR MARKETS ARE BASICALLY NORMALIZED.

35:12 THEY ARE BACK UP TO BALANCE.

35:18 YOU GO DOWN THE LINE AND TO ME IT SUGGESTS WE WILL SEE

35:23 CONTINUED DISINFLATION OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL QUARTERS.

35:27 >> JAY POWELL DID NOT WANT TO DIG INTO THE QUESTION AROUND

35:30 FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND THE EASING OF WHICH WE HAVE SEEN

35:32 OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS, BUT I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO

35:34 WEIGH IN. YOU HAVE CONCERNS THE EASING

35:37 AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS WILL PUSH INFLATION THE OTHER

35:39 DIRECTION.

35:44 >> THAT'S A REASON TO EXPECT ON HOW MUCH THEY CAN END UP DOING.

35:48 I DON'T THINK THEY WILL END UP ON THE EASING OF FINANCIAL

35:49 CONDITIONS IN AND OF THEMSELVES. LABOR MARKETS, INFLATION AND

35:54 THEN FINANCIAL CONDITIONS. IF LABOR MARKETS ARE IN BALANCE

36:02 AND INFLATION IS SLOWING THE MARKETS ARE THEN REASSESSING

36:05 THE FEDS INTEREST RATE PATH SO WHY WOULD THEY BE UPSET ABOUT

36:08 THAT?

36:08 >> YOU HAVE BEEN GOOD ABOUT TRACKING HOMEBUILDERS.

36:12 IF YOU SUDDENLY START TO SEE A RE-ACCELERATION IN THE HOME

36:16 SPACE, YOU SEE PEOPLE RE-ENGAGING WITH SELLING HOMES

36:18 AND BEING ABLE TO PRICE UP SOME OF THESE HOMES BECAUSE MORTGAGE

36:23 RATES ARE LOWER, THESE ARE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS PEOPLE HAVE.

36:25 OF STILL ROBUST GROWTH.

36:28 >> TALKING ABOUT THE SEESAW THING.

36:33 WHERE WE GO FROM ONE STORY BACK TO SOFT LANDING.

36:38 I JUST FEEL LIKE WE NEED TO GET THROUGH THIS DISINFLATION FIRST

36:39 BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.

36:46 COULD I MAKE A CASE FOR THINGS MAY BE RE-ACCELERATING AND

36:49 IGNITE INFLATION IN THE FED WILL HAVE TO COME BACK AND UNDO

36:52 THE CUTS. THAT'S A POSSIBLE SCENARIO.

36:57 THAT COULD REIGNITE INFLATION BECAUSE THERE WON'T BE ENOUGH

37:03 HOUSING SUPPLY. THE FED HAS TO DEAL WITH ISSUES

37:08 IN FRONT OF THEM AND RIGHT NOW THE OVERWHELMING ISSUE IS

37:13 INFLATION IS RAPIDLY SLOWING.

37:16 THEY ARE GOING TO BE MORE COGNIZANT TO THE RISK THEY OVER

37:25 TIGHTENED.

37:26 IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT MY REACTION FUNCTION IS. TOM:

37:39 THE OPTIMISM, ON THE EQUITY CALL, THE SPX 6000.

37:45 HE TALKS ABOUT THE WARRING 2020'S.

37:49 THERE WAS A ROARING 20'S 100 SOME YEARS AGO AND IT DID NOT

37:51 END WELL. HOW IS YOUR OPTIMISM DIFFERENT

37:57 THAN THE EFFERVESCENT EXUBERANCE OF THE UNSTABLE

37:59 ROARING 20'S? NEIL:

38:06 IF WE HAVE A ROARING PERIOD OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IT DOES HELP

38:09 WE HAD A FINANCIAL CRISIS IN 2008.

38:12 WE ALREADY HAD THE BIG ONE AND -- TOM: WE HAVE GUARDRAILS UP.

38:16 NEIL: AND THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT.

38:19 GOING THROUGH ON THE FIRST TIME. SO I THINK THAT'S HELPFUL.

38:25 >> CONGRATULATIONS ON A GREAT CALL. THANK YOU SIR.

38:30 HAPPY CHRISTMAS.

38:33 >> MERRY CHRISTMAS, HAPPY HOLIDAYS. TOM:

38:36 THE ONLY EQUIVALENT I KNOW IS THE 2018 CALL ON THE BULL

38:43 MARKET.

38:44 >> JUST LOCKED IN ON THE DIRECTIONAL TRAVEL.

38:47 EQUITY FUTURES POSITIVE BY A QUARTER OF 1%.

38:52 SHARES CONSTRUCTIVE ON THIS EQUITY MARKET ON RISK ASSETS.

38:57 PETER TCHIR UP NEXT. ♪

39:19 JONATHAN: LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY THIS

39:20 MORNING, GOOD MORNING. EQUITY FUTURES LOOKING

39:28 SOMETHING LIKE THIS ON THE S&P POSITIVE BY 0.2%.

39:31 YIELDS LOWER BY SEVEN BASIS POINTS.

39:35 WHAT A TURNAROUND IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS.

39:38 >> THE INFLATION-ADJUSTED YIELD. ABOVE 2% AND DOWN WE GO.

39:50 THE FIRST PRINT TODAY IS 1.75, MAKE IT 1.76 IS THAT YIELD.

39:57 SLAMMING MARCH, JUNE INTO THE THIRD WEEK OF DECEMBER.

40:05 LISA: EVERYONE SCRAMBLING TO FIGURE

40:06 OUT WHAT THE NEW OUTLOOK IS. HAVING TO REVISE THE OUTLOOK

40:10 FOR NEXT YEAR.

40:17 THEY ARE NOW SCRAMBLING TO OVERHAUL THEM BECAUSE THIS IS A

40:18 DIFFERENT FED THAN THEY THOUGHT. NOW WE ARE LOOKING AT A FED AND

40:24 WE WILL CUT RATES.

40:30 TOM: EIGHT TO 10 PEOPLE, THE TEAM AT

40:33 MORGAN STANLEY. I THINK IT WAS A LITTLE WINDOW.

40:42 IT'S GOING TO BE -- JONATHAN: THE CONSENSUS YESTERDAY IT FELT

40:43 LIKE A VICTORY LAP AT MORGAN STANLEY. LISA:

40:47 JUST IN CASE YOU WERE WONDERING. TOM:

40:55 JOHN YOU TALKED YESTERDAY, HE HAS TO COMPLETELY REFRAME HIS

40:59 VIEW. IT ALL HAPPENED IN ONE DAY.

41:07 >> GOLDMAN SACHS PUT OUT THERE OUTLOOK A MONTH AGO.

41:11 A WEEK OR SO BEFORE CHRISTMAS NOW SAYING OK. WE WILL GO AGAIN.

41:16 TOM: WE WILL GET 4800 FUTURES HERE.

41:20 >> YEAR-END PRICE TARGETS FOR NEXT YEAR.

41:24 WE HAVE 10% OUTSIDE FOR NEXT YEAR.

41:29 DOUBLE-DIGIT PERCENTAGE POINTS GAINS.

41:35 >> PETER, THANK YOU FOR COMING BY

41:38 THIS MORNING.

41:45 WHAT I SEE ON THE SELL SIDE IS PEOPLE LOOKING AT ONE YEARS,

41:48 TWO YEARS, THREE YEARS.

41:56 ALL OF A SUDDEN IT SEEMS POST-COVID, PRE-PANDEMIC.

41:59 WAS THAT THE CELEBRATION WE SAW YESTERDAY.

42:02 THIS IS WHERE WE'VE MOVED ON FROM THE PANDEMIC? PETER:

42:07 I THOUGHT IT WAS CLEAR WE COULD

42:13 GET DOWN TO 420 ON THE 10 YEAR AND YESTERDAY TOOK ME BY

42:15 SURPRISE OF HOW COMFORTABLE POWELL WAS WITH CUTTING RATES.

42:19 I WAS GETTING NERVOUS ABOUT RISK ASSETS BECAUSE I THOUGHT

42:23 THE ONLY WAY WE GET TO 4% IS FOR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS TO TURN

42:27 MUCH WORSE. THEY DID NOT TURN MUCH WORSE

42:29 AND WE ARE AT 4% BECAUSE OF THE FED.

42:32 WE HAVE ROOM FOR US TO RALLY. WE HAVE BEEN A BIG FAN OF THE

42:38 LAGGARDS, THE RUSSELL 2000 WAS UP.

42:42 I RARELY LOOK AT THEIR FUTURES BUT THEY WERE UP.

42:49 THE RUSSELL IS UP MORE THAN THE NASDAQ 100. TOM:

42:55 WHAT ARE THE RAMIFICATIONS IF YIELDS COME DOWN, WHAT TO $6

43:00 TRILLION DO?

43:06 PETER: IT RALLIES. I THOUGHT WE WOULD HAVE THIS

43:07 GREAT RUN BUT AS I LOOK AT WHAT THE FED DID YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT

43:10 THESE POSITIONS. IN THE LAGGARDS YOU LOOK AT

43:14 DISRUPTIVE TECH. YEAR-OVER-YEAR THEY WERE

43:20 ROUGHLY PERFORMING IN LINE WITH THE NASDAQ.

43:22 IT SHOULD BE HIGH DEBATE COMPARED TO THAT.

43:26 YOU GET EXCITED ABOUT THE IPO MARKET COMING BACK.

43:29 A BETTER PLACE FOR RISK ON. HAVING SAID THAT YOU WANT TO BE

43:34 CAUTIOUS ON THINGS THAT MOST PEOPLE WILL LOOK ELSEWHERE.

43:38 SMALL CAPS, THE BANKS, A COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE

43:40 BREATHING NEW LIFE INTO THAT.

43:46 JONATHAN: ONE IS TO LIKE ABOUT THEM RIGHT

43:49 NOW OTHER THAN THE BOND MARKETS RALLYING. PETER:

43:53 PEOPLE GOT FAR TOO DEPRESSED FAR TOO QUICKLY.

43:57 THEY UNDERSOLD THEM. LIKE A LOT OF THINGS, IT TAKES

44:01 A LOT OF TIME EVEN IF THERE ARE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE VOLUMES

44:04 FOR THIS TO WORK ITS WAY THROUGH THE SYSTEM.

44:06 YOU'VE GOT SIX OR SEVEN YEARS. WHAT WAS COMPLETE DOOM AND

44:15 GLOOM IN APRIL, WE WILL RESTRUCTURE, YOU WERE GETTING

44:17 THOSE RETURNS. ALL PEOPLE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT

44:21 WAS HOW BIG TREASURY ISSUANCE WOULD BE.

44:26 THAT HASN'T CHANGED MUCH WITH A FEW RATE CUTS BUT THAT STORY

44:27 WAS OVERPLAYED. HAVING TO ISSUE TRILLIONS IT'S

44:32 GOING OVER YEARS. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WILL

44:37 START TO WEIGH IN ON MARKETS AS WE DIGEST LOOKING AT THE FED’'S

44:40 OFFER BACK WE STILL HAVE THIS DEFICIT TO WORRY ABOUT.

44:43 YIELDS AT 4% ARE ABOUT AS LOW AS THEY GO.

44:50 RISK ASSETS DO OK BUT IT WILL BE THIS TRANSFER INTO THE

44:52 LAGGARDS.

44:55 >> RELATIVE TO WHAT'S ALREADY EXPECTED.

45:01 PETER: ONE THING I WAS STILL LOOKING

45:07 FOR THIS YEAR, SOMETHING OUT OF CHINA WHERE WE GIVE CHINA A

45:12 PATHWAY, WE DO SOMETHING NICE WITH CHINA, WE HAVE NOT SEEN

45:16 THAT YET AND I EXPECT WE WILL SEE THAT INTO JANUARY.

45:19 ANOTHER REASON FOR THIS TO CONTINUE.

45:22 I WAS GETTING VERY NERVOUS ABOUT THESE POSITIONS.

45:24 POWELL REALLY SURPRISED ME. IT'S LIKE OK, THREE CUTS BUT

45:29 IT'S NOT THAT BAD. ONLY BACK TO WHERE WE WERE IN

45:32 JUNE.

45:40 THE FACT HE JUST LET IT GO ON DURING THE PRESS CONFERENCE AND

45:43 DID NOT PUSH BACK ON THE WORK, THAT TELLS ME THEY ARE SERIOUS

45:47 THEY WILL LET THIS GO AND IT IS AN ELECTION YEAR SO THE

45:51 WILLINGNESS TO CREATE A RECESSION IN 2023 WAS MUCH

45:53 HIGHER THAN THE WILLINGNESS INTO AN ELECTION YEAR.

45:56 >> WHICH WE CAN DEVELOP IN A BIT. DO YOU BELIEVE THIS IS

46:00 POLITICALLY INFLUENCED? PETER:

46:06 THEY WANT TO BE CAREFUL TO BE A POLITICAL.

46:09 IT WOULD PROBABLY BE VERY BAD FOR THE ECONOMY.

46:16 IF YOU GO BOOK TO GEORGE BUSH SENIOR, WENT INTO A RECESSION

46:17 AND DID NOT GET REELECTED. THEY ARE WELL AWARE CREATING A

46:22 RECESSION IN ELECTION YEAR IS NOT GOOD FOR PEOPLE IN CHARGE.

46:26 I THINK THEY ARE ALSO NOT PURPOSELY WANTED TO INFLUENCE

46:27 THIS.

46:31 >> WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING BULLISH ON RISK

46:35 AND GOING FURTHER INTO RISKY ASSETS AND BEING ALL IN ON

46:36 GAMESTOP? WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

46:40 BEING CONSTRUCTIVE AND BEING IN A BUBBLE? PETER:

46:44 THE THINGS THAT AREN'T IN TRADING AT 50 MULTIPLES.

46:49 PEOPLE KIND OF THROWING IN THE TOWEL SAYING RECESSION.

46:51 YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON IN CREDIT.

46:57 THE INDEX AT A DERIVATIVE INDEX IT BACK BELOW 60.

47:00 I THINK THERE'S ROOM FOR THAT TO CONTINUE TO TIGHTEN AS

47:03 PEOPLE REALIZE U.S. COMPANIES DID A GOOD JOB

47:05 MANAGING THEIR EXPOSURE. THEY BOUGHT LONG AT LOW YIELDS

47:11 AND IF WE ARE GOING TO AVOID A RECESSION WHICH I THINK THEY

47:13 ARE STILL AT RISK FOR RIGHT NOW IF WE COULD PRICE THAT OUT WE

47:16 HAVE YIELDS LOWER, SPREADS LOWER.

47:17 THAT WILL FUNCTION VERY WELL.

47:27 HIGH YIELD BOND FUND MARKET IS WHEN FORD GOT UPGRADED YOU TOOK

47:28 THAT OUT OF THE MARKET. THAT'S BEEN THIS HUGE

47:34 OPPORTUNITY FOR A LOT OF DOUBLE B AND SINGLE B ISSUERS.

47:36 YOU WILL SEE A LOT OF REFINANCING.

47:39 ONE OF THE PROBLEM AREAS YOU WILL SEE RATE CUTS, I THINK

47:43 THIS FEEDS NICELY INTO STRENGTH. THAT'S NOT WHERE I THOUGHT I

47:45 WOULD BE. JONATHAN: I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE

47:48 POLITICS. DOESN'T THE POLITICAL CALENDAR

47:53 MAKE IT LIKELY THEY GO EARLIER THAN LATER?

47:59 >> I THINK THEY DO NOT WANT TO BE CUTTING IN THE MONTHS RIGHT

48:02 INTO THE ELECTION SO I COULD SEE THIS EASILY.

48:07 THEY LEAVE IT ALONE FOR A WHILE TO SEE HOW THE ECONOMY DOES.

48:11 >> DEUTSCHE BANK HAS AN INTERESTING CALL.

48:14 I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S CHANGED IN THE LAST 24 HOURS.

48:18 I FIND THAT DIFFICULT TO GET MY HEAD AROUND GIVEN WHAT YOU'VE

48:22 JUST SAID.

48:22 >> I CAN SEE 25 AND 50.

48:24 >> WHAT'S THE CUT OFF TODAY FOR YOU?

48:28 WHAT IS THE CUT OFF TATE WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS NOT

48:29 ACCUSED OF BEING PLAYING POLITICS.

48:32 >> MAYBE YOU CAN GET A CUT TILL THE END OF THE SUMMER.

48:38 I THINK THEY WANT TO AVOID THAT. YOU'VE WATCH WHAT'S GOING ON IN

48:39 D.C.. I THINK THE FED IS TRYING TO

48:43 AVOID LISTENING TO THEM.

48:50 WE WERE TRANSITORY UNTIL THE PRESIDENT AND SOME MEMBERS OF

48:53 CONGRESS WERE ALL OVER INFLATION.

48:57 THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN IT WASN'T TRANSITORY AND YOU'VE SEEN A

48:59 DIFFERENT TONE IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS OUT OF D.C.

49:02 AS THEY WANT TO PREPARE FOR A STRONG ECONOMY.

49:08 >> SOUNDS LIKE TRANSITORY -- TOM:

49:10 JUST THE RETURN OF TRANSITORY LATER. JONATHAN:

49:13 GOT TO GO, GOOD TO SEE YOU. 2024 ON THIS RIPROARING RALLY.

49:21 COMING UP VERY SHORTLY WE HAVE ANOTHER CENTRAL-BANK DECISION.

49:24 AFTER THAT IT'S THE ECB.

49:42 >> THE QUESTION OF WHEN IT WILL BE APPROVED HAD TO BE IN BACK

49:47 THE AMOUNT OF POLICY RESTRAINT IS A TOPIC OF DISCUSSION.

49:52 >> THEY ARE VERY EXCITED BY THE FACT THAT INFLATION HAS COME

49:53 DOWN.

49:56 >> INFLATION HAS COME DOWN A LOT.

50:04 >> THE BULLISH SENTIMENT COULD GO ON FOR A WHILE.

50:11 >> I WOULD BE INCLINED TO GO THE OTHER WAY.

50:20 JONATHAN: MORE THAN 20% ON THE NASDAQ.

50:23 THE RALLY CONTINUES. GOOD MORNING.

50:26 PER OUR AUDIENCE WORLDWIDE, I AM ALONGSIDE TOM KEENE AND LISA

50:33 ABRAMOWICZ. MARKET IS HIGHER AGAIN AFTER A

50:37 PIVOT FROM POWELL. TOM: I THINK IT WAS UNANIMOUS.

50:45 THERE WAS NO DISSENT. I LOVE THE BANK OF ENGLAND WITH

50:50 THE DISSENT. JONATHAN: THAT'S GET TO THE DECISION NOW.

50:55 GOOD MORNING, LIZZIE.

51:01 >> THEY SAY THERE IS STILL SOME WAY TO GO.

51:05 THIS IS WHAT WE WERE EXPECTING THE BANK OF ENGLAND TO DO, NOT

51:09 FOLLOWING JAY POWELL INTO THE PIVOT PARTY BUT HOLDING FIRM IN

51:16 SAYING THE INFLATION FIGHT IN THE U.K.

51:17 IS NOT OVER AND IT IS A LITTLE BIT UNIQUE. TOM:

51:23 IT IS EVEN MORE INTERESTING WHAT WE WILL SEE FROM THE ECB

51:26 THIS MORNING. ABSOLUTELY EXTRAORDINARY.

51:31 JONATHAN: HOW MUCH WEAKER IS THE BRITISH

51:39 ECONOMY?

51:40 >> SOFTER THAN EXPECTED GROWTH DATA.

51:42 YOU WOULD THINK THAT WOULD HELP TO MAKE DOVISH ARGUMENT, BUT

51:46 OTHERS WOULD ARGUE IT IS A BLIP IN THE DATA.

51:53 THE FINE LINE BETWEEN STAGNATION AND RECESSION IS NOT

51:54 A GREAT ONE. ANYWAYS A BLEAK PICTURE FOR THE

51:59 U.K. ECONOMY. LISA:

52:07 WHAT WE HEARD YESTERDAY WAS PERHAPS PAVING THE WAY FOR RATE

52:11 CUTS IN THE U.S., BUT A DIFFERENT FEELING IN LONDON.

52:20 YOU CAN SEE YIELDS RISING. HOW MUCH DOES THIS CREATE A

52:28 MORE STAGFLATION OR BACKDROP, UNDERSTANDING THAT IT IS A

52:32 LITTLE MORE ENTRENCHED IN THE U.K. THAN IN THE U.S.

52:33 OR THE REST OF THE REGION?

52:39 >> YOU HAD THE VARIETIES AND RATE CUTS ALREADY, SO NOW THEY

52:47 ARE PRICING IN FIVE QUARTER-POINT CUTS.

52:50 IT HAPPENED WITHOUT ANDREW BAILEY SAYING ANYTHING OR ANY

52:54 EXTRA DATA COMING OUT OF THE U.K.

52:57 IT HAPPENED OFF OF THE BACK OF THE FED DECISION.

53:01 IT SHOWS YOU HOW LITTLE THEY HAD BEEN LISTENING.

53:07 TOM: LISA, WHAT YOU MENTIONED IS IMPORTANT.

53:12 I HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS. THE SEPARATION OF DIVIDE

53:18 BETWEEN THE SHOCK THAT WE SAW YESTERDAY VERSUS NOW.

53:23 WHAT DOES LAGARDE DO TODAY? I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE DIVIDE

53:28 BETWEEN THESE TWO BANKS, EVER. LISA:

53:37 JUST HOW MUCH IS A LOAN RIGHT NOW WHEN THEY ARE LOOKING AT

53:43 THEIR ECONOMY AND BACK DROP VERSUS THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL

53:45 BANK AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE?

53:58 >> IT IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH HITTING THAT 2% TARGET.

54:05 WE HAD THIS AUTUMN STATEMENT WITH PUTTING ONE BILLION POUNDS

54:09 OF FISCAL STIMULUS, PERSONAL AND BUSINESS TAXES, SO IT MAKES

54:14 THE DISINFLATION JOURNEY EVEN HARDER IN THE U.K.

54:18 AND THAT IS THE ARGUMENT THAT ANDREW BAILEY IS MAKING THROUGH

54:22 THIS DECISION, THROUGH THE GUIDANCE.

54:28 WE DO NOT HAVE A FORECAST TODAY EITHER.

54:34 THERE IS A NOTE ON THE GROWTH POINT THAT THEY ARE STILL FLAT

54:35 ON THE GDP. IT IS ACTUALLY WORSE.

54:42 PERHAPS THEY HAVE BEEN INFLUENCED THEN SOFTER THAN

54:46 EXPECTED INFLATION REPORT, BUT IT IS A BLEAK PICTURE IN THE

54:47 U.K. JONATHAN:

54:54 I THINK IF THEY HAD A PLOT, THERE WOULD BE SOME OFFICIALS

54:57 SHOWING THAT THEY WANTED MORE RATE HIKES.

55:02 CABLE AT THE MOMENT IS POSITIVE. THE RALLY IN THE U.K.

55:10 GOVERNMENT BOND MARKET IS FADING JUST A TOUCH.

55:13 DOWN BY SIX BASIS POINTS. YOU REFLECT ON WHAT HAPPENED

55:17 YESTERDAY. CHAIRMAN POWELL WITH A HUGE

55:21 PIVOT. YOU DO NOT GET IT, WHICH

55:27 EXPLAINS TO SOME EXTENT THE LITTLE TURNAROUND. LISA:

55:32 IF PEOPLE WERE LISTENING TO ANDREW BAILEY, THEY WOULD HAVE

55:35 GOTTEN IT RIGHT BECAUSE HE WAS GUIDING IN THIS WAY.

55:41 THIS RAISES THE QUESTION OF, IS IT A MATTER OF THE BANK OF

55:47 ENGLAND LOSING IT EARLIER OR IS IT SUCH A DIFFERENT KIND OF

55:51 ECONOMIC BACKDROP THAT IT REQUIRES A DIFFERENT

55:54 PRESCRIPTION? TOM: THE ECB IS UP NEXT, BUT

55:57 JONATHAN, YOU HAVE DIRECT EXPERIENCE WITH THIS.

55:59 WHAT IS THE CHARACTER OF DISSENT TO RAISE RATES IN

56:02 ENGLAND? THAT IS A POLARITY THAT I HAVE

56:06 NEVER SEEN.

56:15 JONATHAN: THERE IS CLEARLY A WILLINGNESS

56:18 TO DISSENT THAT DOES NOT EXIST AT THE FEDERAL RESERVE RIGHT

56:23 NOW. THERE IS THIS IDEA OF DOING THE

56:26 SAME THING. TOM:

56:36 THESE ARE ABSOLUTELY -- THE DIVIDE BETWEEN THE CENTRAL

56:38 BANKS, I BELIEVE I HAVE NEVER SEEN A. DO YOU PERCEIVE THAT?

56:44 HOW LOAN IS JAY POWELL VERSUS GOVERNOR BAILEY OR WHAT WE WILL

56:46 SEE FROM CHRISTINE LAGARDE?

56:50 >> WHAT THIS REALLY HIGHLIGHTS IS THE DIFFERENCES IN THE

56:56 ECONOMIES THAT EACH OF THE CENTRAL BANKERS IS FACING.

57:02 THERE WAS A BIT OF A PIVOT. THAT HAS SPILLED INTO RATES

57:04 MARKET ACROSS THE REGIONS. THE BANK OF ENGLAND FACES A

57:08 DIFFERENT CHALLENGE. INFLATION IS LESS OF AN OUTLIER.

57:17 THEY STILL HAVE SOME CHALLENGES, IF YOU LOOK AT THE

57:19 CORE INFLATION AND SERVICE AND RATION.

57:27 THAT IS STILL A PROBLEM FOR THE BANK OF ENGLAND, TRYING TO

57:34 MANAGE WEAKER GDP GROWTH AND A STICKY INFLATION PICTURE

57:39 COMPARED TO OTHER REGIONS. THERE IS NO CHANGE IN GUIDANCE

57:44 OR STATEMENT, AND WE STILL HAVE A VOTE SPLIT.

57:47 THAT IS A KEY COMMUNICATION POINT RIGHT THERE, THE FACT

57:50 THAT WE HAVE THAT SPLIT. LISA: LET'S CREATE OUR OWN.

57:58 IF THEY PUT OUT WHETHER THEY THOUGHT THE ECONOMIC GROWTH

58:01 WOULD BE BETTER OR WORSE, WHAT DIRECTION DO YOU THINK IT WOULD

58:02 GO?

58:08 >> WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE RECENT DATA, IT WAS A

58:09 DISAPPOINTMENT THERE.

58:17 IF WE LOOK AT THE MOVING AVERAGES AND PUT IT THROUGH

58:19 THAT CONTRACTION THAT WE SAW MONTH ON MONTH, THAT WAS ACROSS

58:28 THE BOARD BY IF WE SMOOTHED THAT OUT, WE ARE LOOKING AT A

58:33 FLAT THREE-MONTH, BUT THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF A RECESSION.

58:46 IT IS A DIFFICULT BALANCING ACT, BUT WE THINK THEY ARE MORE

58:52 LIKELY TO HOLD ON WITH THIS AND STAY THERE FOR A FEW MORE

58:53 MONTHS YET. TIMING IS QUITE FLUID AND WILL

59:02 DEPEND ON HOW FAST IT DECELERATES, BUT IT MIGHT BE

59:04 ONE OF THE LATER BANKS TO CUT.

59:10 LISA: HOW MUCH DOES THAT BENEFIT BEEN?

59:17 THIS COULD ACTUALLY BE DISINFLATION AREA, IF THEY

59:18 DIVERGE FROM THE OTHER CENTRAL BANKS.

59:25 >> I THINK IT HELPS ON THE IMPACT, BUT REALLY, IT COMES

59:30 DOWN TO THIS WAGE INFLATION THAT IS REALLY GOING TO BE KEY.

59:36 REAL WAGES ARE A LITTLE STRONGER BECAUSE INFLATION HAS

59:37 COME DOWN A LITTLE BIT. THAT SHOULD HELP TO SOME

59:46 EXTENT, BUT THE IMBALANCES IN THE K LABOR MARKET ARE STILL

59:48 THERE. THEY HAVE IMPROVED, BUT THEY

59:51 ARE STILL THERE.

59:58 TOM: WE HAVE A NOMINAL GDP OF 4%.

01:00:04 WHAT IS UA ESTIMATE OF NOMINAL GDP FOR THE BANK OF ENGLAND AND

01:00:05 THE ECB? WHAT ARE THOSE DIFFERENT

01:00:08 NUMBERS THIS MORNING?

01:00:14 >> WE ARE GOING TO SEE A SLOWDOWN IN TERMS OF GDP

01:00:19 GROWTH, PARTICULARLY FOR THE EURO AREA, THE CHALLENGE IS

01:00:24 THAT WE ARE SEEING A MUCH WEAKER INFLATION OUTLOOK THAN

01:00:28 THEY HAVE ACTUALLY PROJECTED, AND WHAT WE ARE PROJECTING

01:00:33 VERSUS WHAT IS HAPPENING, I THINK THAT CHALLENGE IS WHAT WE

01:00:36 ARE REALLY GOING TO SEE LATER ON TODAY FROM THE ECB, WHETHER

01:00:40 -- HOW THEY ADDRESS THE FACT THAT ACTUAL DATA HAS BEEN

01:00:46 WEAKER, INFLATION AND GROWTH -- GROWTH OUTLOOK IS WEAKENING.

01:00:50 THAT COULD BE QUITE IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY SAY OF

01:00:52 THE SHIFT IN TIMING. THE MARKETS HAVE PULLED FORWARD

01:00:58 THE TIMING OF THE FIRST CUTS FROM THE ECB.

01:01:05 NOW WE ARE LOOKING FOR MARCH AND APRIL, MORE LIKELY APRIL.

01:01:10 I THINK THIS IS THE KIND OF SIGNALING THAT WE NEED TO BE

01:01:15 FOCUSING ON, AND TERMS OF WHAT MESSAGES ARE COMING OUT OF THE

01:01:16 ECB LATER TODAY. GOING FORWARD FOR THE U.K.

01:01:22 AS WELL, IT WILL BE THAT RELATIVE SHIFT IN DATA THAT THE

01:01:25 U.K. WILL BE FOCUSING ON IN THE COMING MEETINGS.

01:01:31 JONATHAN: THE LATEST ON THE BANK OF

01:01:35 ENGLAND. IF YOU WERE HOPING FROM A

01:01:42 SYNCHRONIZED PIVOT, YOU DID NOT GET IT FROM THE BANK OF ENGLAND.

01:01:49 LISA: DOES THE ECB GO WITH THE PIVOT

01:01:52 OR DO THEY SIDE WITH WHAT WE SAW FROM THE BANK OF ENGLAND

01:01:55 AND GO THEIR OWN WAY AND REEMPHASIZE THAT THERE COULD BE

01:01:58 MORE TO DO? TOM: THE BANK OF ENGLAND WITHOUT THE

01:02:00 VISIBLE DISSENT.

01:02:07 WE HAVE A 20 BASIS POINT MOVE AND A FOUR TO FIVE BASIS POINT

01:02:08 MOVE. I HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS COME

01:02:11 EVER. JONATHAN:

01:02:18 POSITIVE HERE BY 0.3%. YIELDS ARE A LITTLE BIT LOWER,

01:02:27 DOWN SIX BASIS POINTS, DOWN. FOLLOWING THAT BANK OF ENGLAND

01:02:28 DECISION. LISA: PEOPLE ARE WONDERING WHAT IS

01:02:33 THEIR LEVEL OF CONVICTION? IS THE LEVEL OF INFLATION

01:02:39 DIFFERENT IN THE U.S. VERSUS THE U.K., VERSUS THE

01:02:41 EURO AREA? IS THERE SOMETHING SEPARATE

01:02:46 THAT MAKES SOME OF THEM LONGER-LASTING THAN THE OTHERS?

01:02:49 JONATHAN: LET'S COMPARE. I THINK THAT IS JUST THE

01:02:54 REALITY IN THE MARKETS. IF YOU BELIEVE THE ECB WAS

01:03:01 GOING TO GO FIRST -- THAT WAS CONSENSUS FOR YOU YESTERDAY.

01:03:05 WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR? WHAT ARE THE EXPECTATIONS A

01:03:07 LITTLE BIT LATER ON? LISA:

01:03:14 A LOT OF PEOPLE, INCLUDING SOME OF OUR GUESTS HAVE SAID THAT

01:03:17 THEY THINK THEY SHOULD PROBABLY JUST CUT TODAY BECAUSE THEY ARE

01:03:20 LOOKING AT A POSSIBLE RECESSION. TOM:

01:03:28 I WOULD SUGGEST ONE IS THE REAL ECONOMY.

01:03:32 THE OTHER IS THE FISCAL DEBT BUILDUP IN THE U.S.

01:03:37 AND THEY REALLY DO NOT HAVE THAT PAYOFF THAT POWELL HAD

01:03:38 JUST YESTERDAY. JONATHAN:

01:03:44 WE WILL CATCH UP WITH THEM IN THE NEXT HOUR.

01:03:49 RIP ROARING RALLY OVER THE LAST MONTH AND IT CONTINUES FROM NEW

01:03:59 YORK CITY.

01:04:06 >> IT WOULD BE PREMATURE TO CONCLUDE WITH CONFIDENCE THAT

01:04:09 WE HAVE A RESTRICTIVE STANCE OR TO SPECULATE ON WHEN POLICY

01:04:10 MIGHT BE EASING.

01:04:20 QUEST IT BEGINS TO COME INTO VIEW AND IT IS A TOPIC OF

01:04:21 DISCUSSION. JONATHAN: THOSE QUOTES NOT EVEN TWO WEEKS

01:04:26 APART. LIGHTING THE FUSE UNDER THIS

01:04:31 MARKET. EQUITY IS ON THE S&P 500 LIKE

01:04:36 THIS. FUTURES ARE POSITIVE.

01:04:44 GAINS OF MORE THAN 1%. LIKEWISE ON THE NASDAQ.

01:04:50 ABSOLUTELY FLYING AND THE BANKS ARE LOVING THIS MOVE IN THE

01:04:51 BOND MARKET. LISA: MORE THAN 5% IN ONE DAY.

01:04:57 THIS IS THE QUESTION. CAN THAT WIDENING OUT CONTINUE?

01:05:07 YOU'RE GETTING THE SENSE THAT THE RATES ARE LOWER. JONATHAN:

01:05:11 DOES IT COMPLICATE THE TIMING? TOM:

01:05:18 I DO NOT THINK WE HAVE REALLY BEEN AS CONSPIRACY THEORIES.

01:05:22 I LOVE WHAT YOU DID YESTERDAY WITH THEM WEIGHING IN.

01:05:27 THE UNUSUALNESS OF THIS IN THE MARKET.

01:05:34 LET'S BE HONEST. YOU JUST WONDER WITHIN THE DIVIDE OF THE

01:05:38 NATION, THE NUMBER OF OUR GUESTS YESTERDAY.

01:05:41 I THOUGHT JEFF WAS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT ABOUT THE DIVIDE IN

01:05:44 AMERICA AND HOW IT FOLDS OVER.

01:05:50 JONATHAN: IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR WHAT

01:05:52 MIGHT HAPPEN IN THE ELECTION. THE MORNING CONSOLE POLL

01:05:59 SHOWING THAT FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP IS PULLING AHEAD IN MUST

01:06:02 WIN MICHIGAN.

01:06:08 CANNOT CHANGE BETWEEN NOW AND THEN? TOM:

01:06:15 THAT NUMBER OF INFLATION. A DOZEN EGGS THIS MORNING,

01:06:18 MAYBE THAT WILL HELP THE PAIN AT THE GROCERY STORE.

01:06:26 HE KNOWS THE POLLS AND RICK DAVIS IS JOINING US.

01:06:29 HE IS A PARTNER. POLITICS FOR THE LATE SENATOR.

01:06:38 I WANT TO GO DOWN. THIS IS OFF OF THE WASHINGTON

01:06:44 POST ARTICLE SUNDAY OR SATURDAY THAT ONLY 18% OF AMERICA WILL

01:06:47 DECIDE WHO THE PRESIDENT WILL BE.

01:06:53 IT IS NOT NARROW WITH THE SWING STATES AND ALL OF THAT.

01:06:59 WHAT DID THEY SAY ABOUT THOSE ROUGHLY 18% OF AMERICANS?

01:07:04 >> THIS IS THE THIRD POLE IN A SERIES.

01:07:07 BLOOMBERG HAS BEEN TESTING SEVEN BATTLEGROUND STATES SINCE

01:07:11 EARLY OCTOBER AND WHAT IT IS TELLING US IS THAT DONALD TRUMP

01:07:17 CONTINUES TO SHOW STRENGTH ACROSS THOSE STATES, THAT JOE

01:07:25 BIDEN SHOWS WEAKNESS ACROSS THE STATES AND HAS GOTTEN A LITTLE

01:07:29 BIT WEAKER, ESPECIALLY IN THE CRITICAL STATE OF MICHIGAN.

01:07:35 MICHIGAN IS A CLASSIC STUDY OF A SWING STATE THAT MEANS

01:07:36 EVERYTHING TO JOE BIDEN. HE DOES NOT WIN WITHOUT

01:07:43 MICHIGAN, YET MICHIGAN WAS TIED IN THE PREVIOUS TVO POLLS AND

01:07:48 IS NOW BEHIND TRUMP FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIS SERIES IN

01:07:49 MICHIGAN. LOOK AT MICHIGAN.

01:08:01 WE HAD UAW STRIKES, A LOT OF

01:08:09 FOCUS AS IT RELATES TO ISRAEL

01:08:15 CONFLICT AND JOE BIDEN IS SLIPPING AWAY. TOM:

01:08:20 CAN YOU GAUGE TURNOUT NOW? IF NOT, WHEN CAN YOU GAUGE WHAT

01:08:24 THE TURNOUT WILL BE?

01:08:29 >> IT IS HARD TO GAUGE TURNOUT. YOU ARE REALLY TALKING ABOUT

01:08:31 THE INTENSITY. NEITHER TRUMP NOR BIDEN EXCITE

01:08:36 VOTERS RIGHT NOW.

01:08:42 THEY WISH THEY HAD A DIFFERENT OPTION, SO IF IT COMES DOWN TO

01:08:47 IT, THESE ARE THE CANDIDATES AVAILABLE A FROM NOW.

01:08:53 IT WILL BE HARD TO IMAGINE THAT YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE RECORD

01:08:56 TURNOUT THAT YOU DID IN 2020. THAT BEING SAID, THE STAKES OF

01:08:59 THE ELECTION HAVE NOT BEEN WELL DEFINED.

01:09:05 JOE BIDEN REALLY HAS NOT CAMPAIGNED THAT MUCH.

01:09:08 I THINK THIS IS A POORLY FORMED CAMPAIGN.

01:09:11 WE WILL SEE IF THEY CAN LIGHTED UP LATER ON.

01:09:17 LISA: A LOT OF PEOPLE DISCOUNT THESE

01:09:22 POLLS AS EARLY WITHOUT REALLY THINKING ABOUT THE OPPONENT.

01:09:25 DO YOU BUY INTO ANY OF THOSE ARGUMENTS?

01:09:31 >> THERE IS A LOT GOING ON IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY RIGHT NOW.

01:09:35 THIS IS A CONSISTENT POLE WITH WHAT WE HAVE SEEN NATIONALLY.

01:09:41 THEY HAVE THIS BASE WEAKNESS WITH JOE BIDEN SINCE OCTOBER.

01:09:46 BIDEN'S PROBLEM IS NOT SWAYING VOTERS, IT IS WITH HIS BASE.

01:09:51 ONE IN FIVE SAY THEY SUPPORT THE IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY.

01:09:55 CAN YOU IMAGINE DEMOCRATS SUPPORTING AN IMPEACHMENT OF

01:09:58 THEIR OWN PRESIDENT? IT IS OUTRAGEOUS.

01:10:04 THE DEMOCRATS SAY, THIS IS THEIR EXCUSE.

01:10:06 THE BASE IS ALWAYS GOING TO COME BACK.

01:10:10 WHEN THE CHOICE IS JOE BIDEN OR ELECTING DONALD TRUMP, THEY ARE

01:10:11 ALWAYS GOING TO SUPPORT JOE BIDEN.

01:10:14 ARE THEY GOING TO BE EXCITED ABOUT TURNING OUT OR STAYING

01:10:16 HOME? LISA:

01:10:23 FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN PRETTY QUIET, NOT NECESSARILY

01:10:26 WHEN IT COMES TO RHETORIC, BUT HE HAS NOT BEEN SHOWING UP TO

01:10:30 THE DEBATES. HOW MUCH DO YOU EXPECT THE

01:10:33 GROUNDSWELL OF SUPPORT FOR TRUMP TO MATERIALIZE IN THE

01:10:36 HEADING INTO THIS ELECTION VERSUS NOT SO MUCH AS SOME OF

01:10:41 THE OTHER CANDIDATES START TO GAIN SOME CRITICAL MASS?

01:10:49 >> HE IS NOT MOVING AROUND VERY MUCH.

01:11:00 THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT TRUMP'S LACK OF CAMPAIGNING.

01:11:02 HE IS SITTING IN HIS BASEMENT, NOT GOING ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.

01:11:10 NOW HE IS DOING FOUR TO FIVE EVENTS A MONTH.

01:11:12 HE SPENDS MORE TIME IN A COURTROOM THAT HE DOES IN IOWA,

01:11:16 TRYING TO WIN THE CAUCUSES. IF HE HAS ANY KIND OF PICKUP,

01:11:24 IF NIKKI HALEY CHALLENGES HIM OR BEATS HIM IN NEW HAMPSHIRE,

01:11:28 IT COULD REDEFINE THE ENTIRE ELECTION AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,

01:11:31 HE DOES NOT LOOK AS STRONG AS VOTERS THINK THAT HE IS.

01:11:36 JONATHAN: IT IS JUST A LACK OF UNION

01:11:40 SUPPORT. THE PRESIDENT AND MICHIGAN

01:11:42 JOINING THE PICKET LINE AND CANNOT GET A PICK UP AND

01:11:44 SUPPORT. WHAT IS GOING WRONG?

01:11:48 >> THIS PRESIDENT SINCE THE DAY HE WAS ELECTED HAS BEEN A UNION

01:11:51 MAN. HE HAS DONE MORE FOR UNIONS IN

01:11:56 AMERICA THAN ANY OTHER PRESIDENT, AND THEY HAVE ALL

01:11:59 DECIDED THAT THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS RACE AND

01:12:01 DETERMINE IF IT IS IN THEIR SELF INTERESTS TO SUPPORT

01:12:06 SOMEONE ELSE.

01:12:12 BIDEN'S WEAKNESS IS THAT HE JUST DOES NOT SEEM ABLE TO

01:12:13 MANAGE THE ECONOMY. THE HEADLINES THIS MORNING

01:12:18 SHOULD HELP HIM LONG-TERM. AS THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO

01:12:22 IMPROVE, DOES THAT HAVE AN IMPACT WITH UNION HOUSEHOLDS

01:12:25 AND OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL UNDECIDED?

01:12:32 JONATHAN: IS THE PRESIDENT DOING THE SAME

01:12:33 THING?

01:12:38 >> THE QUESTION IS, IS HE AHEAD OF TIME OR A LAGGARD?

01:12:43 THERE IS AN ARGUMENT TO BE MADE THAT BAD NYMEX IS GOING TO

01:12:48 ULTIMATELY SUCCEED AND THAT PEOPLE WILL START REALIZING

01:12:51 THAT THE ECONOMY IS ACTUALLY HEALTHIER THAN THEY HAVE FELT

01:12:55 IT BEING OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS, THAT THE MISTS ON

01:12:57 INFLATION IS IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR AT THAT POINT AND THEN

01:13:04 THEY START GIVING BIDEN CREDIT FOR

01:13:05 MANAGING THE ECONOMY. HEADLINES ARE IMPORTANT TO

01:13:14 VOTERS.

01:13:15 WE WILL SEE THAT MOVEMENT. THERE ARE INDICATIONS IN THE

01:13:19 SURVEY THAT PEOPLE HAVE A VERY POSITIVE ATTITUDE TOWARDS THEIR

01:13:23 LOCAL ECONOMY. THAT IS AN INDICATION TO THE

01:13:27 BIDEN PEOPLE THAT THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT

01:13:30 THEIR LOCAL ECONOMY IS DOING BETTER AND THE NATIONAL ECONOMY

01:13:31 IS ON THE MEND AS WELL. JONATHAN: THANK YOU.

01:13:38 SHOCKING TO SEE THAT UNION SUPPORT. IT IS NOT THERE. TOM:

01:13:44 HE HAD NO MONEY AND HE WON AND DELAWARE.

01:13:47 HE IS LIVING AND ANOTHER TIME AND PLACE. JONATHAN:

01:14:08 JONATHAN: THE RALLY CONTINUES. WE HARDLY TALKED ABOUT IT, BUT

01:14:11 RETAIL SALES COMING OUT FROM THAT DATA POINT.

01:14:13 EQUITY LOOKS LIKE THIS, ELEVATED BY 3%.

01:14:17 LET'S NOT GLOSS OVER IT. UP ANOTHER 1.4% THIS MORNING.

01:14:24 LISA: THEY HAVE BEEN CONSISTENTLY

01:14:26 EATING THE OTHER INDEX IS.

01:14:33 IS THIS BEGINNING OF A BROADENING OUT OR HAS IT BEEN A

01:14:34 HEAD FAKE? HERE WE ARE.

01:14:40 JONATHAN: LIVES ARE LIKE 100 BASIS POINTS.

01:14:45 TWO YEAR RIGHT NOW. 10-YEAR, 394.

01:14:55 394.69. A LITTLE BIT -- 3.9469.

01:15:01 IT IS INTERESTING FRAMING.

01:15:07 THE BRINGING FORWARD OF RATE CUTS IS AN INDICATION OF

01:15:12 FINE-TUNING POLICY, NOT AN INDICATION THAT IT HAS BEEN

01:15:14 ACHIEVED AS MARKETS ARE PRICING. TOM:

01:15:20 IT SPEAKS TO THE DATA DEPENDENCY AND MAKES IT MORE

01:15:21 INTERESTING. IF YOU SLAM FORWARD INTO WHAT

01:15:26 WE WITNESSED YESTERDAY, EVERYBODY RECALIBRATED.

01:15:31 PETER MENTIONED THIS EARLIER. WE ARE BLATHERING ON ABOUT THE

01:15:42 BANK OF ENGLAND, POINT 3% OF A PERCENTAGE POINT AND IT IS

01:15:43 EXTRAORDINARY. UP ON THE SMALL CAPS OF AMERICA.

01:15:51 JONATHAN: LET'S TURN TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE.

01:15:54 WE SAW THIS PLAY OUT WITH THE FEDERAL RESERVE.

01:15:59 WE HAVE YET TO GET THAT PITTED. WHAT YOU DON'T GET, IT IS

01:16:08 STRONGER WITH POSITIVE BY .8%. BASICALLY, THE BANK OF ENGLAND

01:16:14 HAS PEOPLE VOTING FOR RATE HIKES STILL.

01:16:18 COMPROMISING THE ABILITY TO DO WHAT CHAIRMAN POWELL DID

01:16:22 YESTERDAY. LISA: THERE IS A LOT MORE WORK TO DO

01:16:26 ON THE INFLATION FRONT.

01:16:29 THIS TYPE OF DIVERGENCE HAS AN INTERESTING QUESTION FOR THE

01:16:34 ECB. DO THEY LIKE THAT THEY ARE SEEING A STRONGER EURO

01:16:39 ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE THE LIKES OF JEFFREY TALKING ABOUT

01:16:41 THE POSSIBILITY OF PARITY. THEY COULD ACHIEVE DISINFLATION.

01:16:49 JONATHAN: A TOUGH ACT TO FOLLOW AFTER JAY

01:16:53 POWELL SIGNALED THAT A PIVOT IS COMING. SIX RATE CUTS.

01:17:02 THEY ARE LOOKING FOR ANY PUSHBACK AFTER THE FED SPARKED

01:17:04 A SURGE ACROSS THE GLOBE YESTERDAY.

01:17:08 THIS IS THE QUESTION THAT WE WERE ASKING GOING INTO

01:17:09 YESTERDAY'S POSITION. WE DID NOT GET ANY PUSHBACK,

01:17:14 WHATSOEVER. TOM:

01:17:20 HOW DOES CHRISTINE LAGARDE DEAL? BAILEY HAS TO DEAL WITH

01:17:25 CATHERINE AND THEY WANT HIGHER RATES BUT HOW DOES SHE DEAL

01:17:28 WITH THE BANK HERE? I HAVE NO UNDERSTANDING OF THAT

01:17:30 PROCESS. JONATHAN:

01:17:36 A LOT OF PEOPLE PICKED UP ON IT. MAYBE GETTING SOME SUPPORT FROM

01:17:41 THAT DIRECTION, BUT IT IS A VERY DIVERSE COUNCIL WITH A

01:17:44 RANGE OF OPINIONS. THERE WILL STILL BE PEOPLE

01:17:49 SCARRED BY THEIR EXPERIENCE AND UNWILLING TO ENGAGE IN THE IDEA

01:17:52 THAT RATE CUT I JUST AROUND THE CORNER. LISA:

01:17:57 IN TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL BE LATE TO DEBATE CUTTING

01:18:03 CYCLE, WILL THE ECB TAKE THE SAME TONE? JONATHAN:

01:18:08 RETAIL SALES ARE COMING IN.

01:18:14 DATA INDICATING A SLOWER START TO HOLIDAY SALES.

01:18:18 EXPECTING CONSUMERS TO PULL BACK AFTER SPLURGING IN THE

01:18:21 SUMMER. SOME CASH BACK MAKING PEOPLE

01:18:26 THINK TWICE ABOUT THAT, MAKING YOU THINK TWICE.

01:18:34 EASY TO FORGET HASBRO CUTTING OFF HALF OF THE STAFF A WEEK

01:18:35 AWAY FROM CHRISTMAS. TOM:

01:18:41 IT IS A CRAZY SEASON AND I DO NOT KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN.

01:18:47 HEART OF THE MATTER LOOKING AT THIS RETAIL SALES REPORT ARE

01:18:50 THE GUESSTIMATES FROM MIKE MCKEE AND OTHERS ABOUT NOMINAL

01:18:52 GDP. IF IT IS SOGGY, THAT CHANGES

01:18:55 THE DEBATE. JONATHAN: GOOD NEWS. RENT IN MANHATTAN MAKING THEIR

01:19:05 FIRST YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECLINE IN 27 MONTHS.

01:19:09 MEDIAN PRICES SITTING AT $1000 FOR NOVEMBER.

01:19:13 DOWN NEARLY 5% FROM THE PREVIOUS MONTH.

01:19:18 PRESIDENT OF THE RETAIL FIRM SAYING IT BEYOND SEASONAL.

01:19:21 YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN. THIS IS WHAT IS AMAZING.

01:19:28 WE SET HERE AND WE SAY, NEWS, THE RENT IS NOT GOING UP.

01:19:34 THE FIRST YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECLINE.

01:19:36 AND THEN YOU READ THE PRICE. THAT IS THE REALITY.

01:19:40 MONTH OVER MONTH, YEAR-OVER-YEAR , EVERYONE HAS

01:19:42 TO LIVE THIS. THEY ARE LOOKING AT RENT AT

01:19:46 $4000. TOM: I AM DOING THE MATH HERE.

01:19:53 48,000 AND IF YOU SPEND ONE THIRD OF YOUR INCOME, YOU HAVE

01:19:59 TO HAVE AN INCOME OF $45,000 TO BUY THE MEDIAN RENT.

01:20:02 THAT IS A CHALLENGE. PEOPLE ARE NOT SPENDING A THIRD

01:20:05 OF THEIR INCOME. IS IT UNIQUE TO NEW YORK?

01:20:11 I THINK YOU HAVE BETTER CONTACTS THAN I DO.

01:20:17 FOR A LARGE BODY OF AMERICANS, THERE IS NO OTHER TOPIC. LISA:

01:20:24 THERE ARE SPECIFIC THINGS FOR THE UNITS GOING BACK ON THE

01:20:26 MARKET TO BE RENTED OUT, BUT IT IS CLEAR TO ME THAT WE ARE

01:20:31 TALKING ABOUT A MUCH HIGHER PRICE POINT, WHICH IS THE

01:20:34 REASON WHY PEOPLE ARE WONDERING IF THERE IS GOING TO BE A

01:20:36 CRACKING IN THE CONSUMER CONFIDENCE.

01:20:42 TOM: THE MATH I JUST DID DOES NOT

01:20:44 WORK.

01:20:52 HE IS FROM CANADA AND HE HAS HAD A THRILL IN THE TUMULT.

01:20:59 OF BLACK ROCK AND PRINCETON ECONOMICS.

01:21:04 WE COULD HAVE A THREE HOUR CONVERSATION NOW TO GATHER SOME

01:21:07 OF THE BANK OF ENGLAND ACT TO THE FED.

01:21:09 LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT WE DO ABOUT IT IN THE MARKET.

01:21:15 WHAT IS THE PRESCRIPTION THIS MORNING, GIVEN THE SHOCK THAT

01:21:18 WE SAW YESTERDAY?

01:21:18 >> IT WAS A SHOCKER.

01:21:25 YESTERDAY, TIMMY WHAT IS SHOCKING IS THE FACT THAT WE

01:21:31 THINK THIS IS AN UNCERTAIN ENVIRONMENT AND WE HAVE NEVER

01:21:34 BEEN -- WE ARE NORMALIZING FROM IT.

01:21:39 WE DO NOT QUITE KNOW WHERE WE ARE STARTING FROM.

01:21:41 A WIDE RANGE OF UNCERTAINTY, BUT WE HAVE A SAID THAT IS

01:21:49 NARROWING THE OUTCOME IN A VERY AGGRESSIVE WAY.

01:21:53 TO ME, IT IS NOT SO MUCH BUT THEY ARE PLANNING TO DO NEXT

01:21:57 YEAR. IT IS THE NARRATIVE AROUND IT.

01:21:59 IT IS ALL IN TO THAT STORY AND

01:22:05 I THINK THAT IS THE SHOCKER HERE BECAUSE I THINK THE

01:22:07 REALITY THAT WE ARE FACING A MUCH WIDER RANGE.

01:22:12 OUR JOB IS TO TAKE THEY HAD COME CALLS AND POSITION FOR

01:22:13 THAT.

01:22:21 I FEEL LIKE THE ROLES ARE A LITTLE BIT REVERSED HERE.

01:22:27 THE MARKET IS NOW RUNNING. JONATHAN:

01:22:33 YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT A NEW REGIME, A CHANGE.

01:22:34 YOU QUESTION THAT AFTER WHAT YOU HEARD YESTERDAY?

01:22:42 >> I THINK WE ARE IN A NEW REGIME.

01:22:46 I DO NOT THINK CENTRAL BANKS HAVE A BETTER HANDLE OF WHAT IS

01:22:48 TO COME NEXT. WE ARE ALL TRYING TO LEARN FROM

01:22:51 THIS. IT IS ABOUT LEARNING FROM THE

01:22:53 DATA. THERE IS A SCENARIO WHERE WE

01:23:01 MIGHT GET SOME DISINFLATION AND IT DEPENDS, BUT IT IS NOT THE

01:23:04 ONLY SCENARIO. ALL THESE SCENARIOS ARE TO THE

01:23:09 DOWNSIDE, SO WE STILL BELIEVE IN THE OUTLOOK AND THE TEAM

01:23:14 THAT WE HAVE.

01:23:22 IF YOU DO NOT HAVE CONVICTION, MAYBE ONCE YOU NEUTRALIZE THAT

01:23:25 BUT CENTRAL BANKS ARE MAKING BIG BEDS AND IT DOES NOT REDUCE

01:23:32 THE UNCERTAINTY BUT YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE ENVIRONMENT. LISA:

01:23:36 DOES IT MAKE YOU MORE OPTIMISTIC ON RISK ASSETS?

01:23:41 >> I THINK WE HAVE A GREEN LIGHT FOR NOW.

01:23:44 GIVEN THE POSITION NOW, IT IS THE CASE THAT IT WILL TAKE SOME

01:23:48 DEPLOYMENTS TO CHANGE THE NARRATIVE.

01:23:58 I THINK WE HAVE A CONSTRUCTIVE BACKDROP IN THE NEAR TERM.

01:24:02 I THINK THE QUESTION IS WHEN DOES THAT NARRATIVE FACE A

01:24:07 CHALLENGE?

01:24:08 THE KEY THING TO WATCH WOULD BE THE DEVELOPMENT.

01:24:12 IT IS A STORY ABOUT GOODS INFLATION, NOT ABOUT SERVICES.

01:24:17 I THINK WE NEED TO WAIT FOR THEM TO COME IN, BUT FOR NOW,

01:24:22 THIS IS A GREEN LIGHT FOR RISK ASSET. LISA:

01:24:26 DO YOU BELIEVE IN THE BROADENING OUT STORY COMING

01:24:31 BEFORE AND FINALLY SEEING MONEY? >> I THINK THAT WILL BE THE

01:24:39 MARKET REACTION, TO SEE THIS MACRO BACKDROP.

01:24:46 THE FED IS BASICALLY GIVING A SIGNAL THAT MACRO SHOULD BE

01:24:49 YOUR FRIEND FOR NOW AND I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE TESTED BUT FOR

01:24:54 NOW, THIS IS THE STORY. IF YOU BELIEVE IN THAT STORY --

01:25:01 I THINK WE SEE SOME MOMENTUM. THAT IS VERY NEAR TERM TRADING.

01:25:07 I'M NOT SURE THIS IS LASTING. TOM: I WENT TO A BLACKROCK MONEY

01:25:12 FUND.

01:25:19 WORKING WITH 5.11% FOR A BLENDED MONEY MARKET YIELD.

01:25:24 WHAT DOES ALL OF THAT MONEY DO WHEN THE YIELD COMES DOWN?

01:25:31 >> I THINK THAT HAS BEEN SITTING -- SETTING A HIGH BAR

01:25:32 FOR RISK ASSETS. WE HAVE BEEN COMPETING AND ONCE

01:25:41 YOU TRY TO DEPLOY RISK AND PUT MONEY TO WORK BEYOND CASH AND

01:25:46 SHORT-TERM RATES AND MONEY MARKET, IT IS DIFFICULT TO MAKE

01:25:51 THE CASE. IF THOSE RATES ARE FALLING

01:25:54 FASTER, I THINK YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT PUTTING PEOPLE TO

01:25:55 WORK FASTER. WE STILL THOUGHT 2024 IS WHERE

01:26:01 YOU NEED TO START DOING THAT. IF RATES WERE TO COME DOWN,

01:26:06 THAT WOULD ACCELERATE THAT, TO SOME EXTENT.

01:26:08 I THINK WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL. WE ARE STILL PRETTY CAUTIOUS.

01:26:15 I THINK THE FED HAS MORE DIRECTION.

01:26:22 THAT IS GAP. JONATHAN: THANK YOU.

01:26:27 LISA PICKED UP ON IT AS WELL.

01:26:33 WE ASKED HOW MUCH THAT WOULD BE AND THE ANSWER IS TONS, BUT IT

01:26:39 HAS GONE IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. LISA:

01:26:46 THERE IS JUST AS MUCH DAYLIGHT. THEY GOT THE GREENLIGHT SAYING

01:26:52 THAT THAT BIAS IS TO CUT RATES ABOVE ALL ELSE. TOM:

01:26:57 IT IS AMAZING. IT GOODS US TO 30 TO 32 MINUTES.

01:27:03 WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT INTO THE CENTRAL

01:27:06 BANK GAME? IT FALLS INTO WHAT I AM

01:27:12 WITNESSING, WHICH IS A PERSISTENT BID ON EQUITIES.

01:27:15 NOT ONCE, BUT EVERY SECOND. JONATHAN:

01:27:22 IF YOU ARE JUST JOINING US, HERE ARE THE SCORES.

01:27:23 POSITIVE BY .3%. THE CONVERSATION WILL CONTINUE

01:27:30 WITH STEPHANIE ROTH.

01:27:37 RETAIL SALES ARE STILL TO COME, JUST AROUND THE CORNER, 8:30

01:27:38 EASTERN TIME. TOM: GOING INTO THE WEEKEND, GOING

01:27:43 INTO THE YEAR. JONATHAN: SHUT IT DOWN, LOCK IT IN, WALK

01:27:48 AWAY. TOM: THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE

01:27:53 THAT GOT THIS WRONG. I GOT IT WRONG. JONATHAN:

01:27:58 THEY CANNOT SHUT IT DOWN AND WALK AWAY. MONEY MARKET FUNDS.

01:28:04 TOM: I AM WATCHING. IT HAS NEVER BEEN LIKE IT IS.

01:28:09 IT IS THE STIMULUS AND THE PANDEMIC.

01:28:11 IT IS NEW BEHAVIOR THAT WILL KEEP US OCCUPIED INTO THE NEW

01:28:13 YEAR. JONATHAN: WE WILL TALK ABOUT ONE OF THE

01:28:19 WORST-PERFORMING STOCKS ON THE MARKET, NEXT.

01:28:38 >> I THINK THE FED IS FOLLOWING A RULES-BASED FRAMEWORK.

01:28:44 THEY HAD TRANSLATING THAT INTO EXPECTATIONS AROUND THE FEDERAL

01:28:45 FUNDS RATE. THAT IS BASICALLY WHAT IS

01:28:49 HAPPENING, WHAT THEY DID YESTERDAY.

01:28:53 INFLATION IS COMING IN BETTER.

01:29:02 I THINK IT IS GOING TO GIVE THE ECONOMY THE CHANCE TO CONTINUE

01:29:03 GROWING.

01:29:10 JONATHAN: THE HEAD OF ECONOMICS MACRO.

01:29:11 HE GOT IT RIGHT IN A BIG WAY THE LAST COUPLE OF.

01:29:21 THE BOND MARKETS ARE STILL RALLYING BY SEVEN BASIS POINTS.

01:29:27 THE FX MARKET, 1.0 930. THAT ECB IS THAT EVEN ITS CLAIM.

01:29:40 -- IS 13 MINUTES AWAY. TOM: THE FIRST QUESTION, HOW DOES

01:29:45 SHE RESPOND?

01:29:55 JONATHAN: WE NEED SOME HUMILITY HERE.

01:30:00 A LITTLE BIT MORE SPACE AND ROOM FOR CHRISTINE LAGARDE TO

01:30:03 DO THE SAME THING AFTER WHAT CHAIR POWELL DID YESTERDAY. TOM:

01:30:07 WE WILL CONTINUE WITH AN IMPORTANT DISCUSSION.

01:30:19 IT BALLOONED OUT WELL OVER $400 PER SHARE.

01:30:22 THE COVID PEAK HAS COME DOWN TO $78 A SHARE.

01:30:32 THE BEGINNING, -- THEY GAVE US GREAT LEADERSHIP.

01:30:36 WE KNOW THAT OUT OF THE INCREDIBLE PROGRAM.

01:30:40 I WANT TO GO TO ONE OF THE GREAT PEOPLE THAT WE LOST THIS

01:30:45 YEAR, A SINGER-SONGWRITER, JIMMY BUFFETT.

01:30:47 HE DIED OF SKIN CANCER. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT

01:30:51 SKIN CANCER? EVERY LISTENER, EVERY VIEWER,

01:30:54 IT IS AN UNSPOKEN FEAR.

01:30:57 >> GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME TODAY.

01:31:03 TODAY IS A HUGE DAY OF HOPE FOR CANCER PATIENTS IN GENERAL.

01:31:10 SKIN CANCER IS A SCARY THING. WHAT WE ARE DOING AT MODERNA IS

01:31:15 WE ARE DEVELOPING INDIVIDUALIZED TREATMENT.

01:31:22 WE MAKE A DIFFERENT CHEMICAL DRUG AND IT GETS CUSTOMIZED.

01:31:26 THEY ARE STRIKING.

01:31:44 THE DATA THAT WAS SHARED FROM 34%.

01:31:56 THE BEST DRUG AVAILABLE TODAY.

01:32:02 WE SEE A LOT OF IDEAS MANUFACTURING WISE.

01:32:09 PHASE 3 IS WORKING VERY QUICKLY. AT THE SAME TIME, THE DATA IS

01:32:13 SO STRONG.

01:32:24 WE ARE ALSO WINNING TO SEE THE PATH FOR ACCELERATING APPROVAL.

01:32:30 IT IS VERY SIMILAR. THERE IS A VERY INTERESTING

01:32:35 RISK REWARD OPPORTUNITY HERE. WE WANTED A CHANCE TO MAKE IT.

01:32:45 TOM: I THINK OF BRISTOL-MYERS AND

01:32:49 THEIR COMMITMENT TO CANCER THERAPIES OVER DECADES.

01:32:55 CAN YOU DO THIS BY GOING ALONE OR DO YOU NEED TO MERGE IN

01:32:59 JOINT VENTURE WITH A BIGGER PLATFORM?

01:33:05 >> WE ARE PARTNERED WITH MERCK. WHAT WE ARE SHARING TODAY IS,

01:33:11 WE COMPARED TO TO BE A POPULATIONS.

01:33:14 ONE GETS THE MERCK DRUG AND THE

01:33:20 OTHER GETS THE MERCK DRUG FOR A PRODUCT THAT IS INDIVIDUALIZED

01:33:22 FOR THEM. THAT IS WHERE YOU SEE THE BIG

01:33:25 DIFFERENCE.

01:33:37 COMMERCIALLY, CLINICALLY, SOME STUDIES -- I THINK WE HAVE

01:33:39 LEARNED THE STUDY.

01:33:46 WE BELIEVE THAT TECHNOLOGY WILL HAVE A BIG IMPACT.

01:33:48 WE ARE VERY EXCITED. WE ARE GOING AFTER MORE CANCERS

01:33:53 IN 2024.

01:34:01 MODERNA GOT A HUGE BOOST. IT ROSE TREMENDOUSLY.

01:34:04 IT STRUGGLED LAST YEAR WITH SHARES LOWER BY ALMOST 30%.

01:34:10 HOW IMPORTANT IS IT TO YOU TO GET THE CANCER VACCINE OFF OF

01:34:13 THE GROUND TO OFFSET THE LACK OF SALES AND SOME OF THE

01:34:18 VACCINES THAT WE HAVE SEEN WITH THE LATEST OUT OF PFIZER?

01:34:31 WHAT HAPPENED WITH COVID, WE HAD $18 BILLION SALES, WHICH IS

01:34:34 A LOT COMPARED TO OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES.

01:34:47 IF YOU LOOK AT IT, AS WE SAID IN 24, WE ARE GETTING A MARKET

01:34:49 SHARE. IF YOU LOOK AT IT, 36% MARKET

01:34:54 SHARE. 52 TO 30%.

01:35:09 IF YOU LOOK, IT IS A BIG OPPORTUNITY.

01:35:16 IT IS AROUND -- WE BELIEVE WE ARE GETTING THE BEST PRODUCT ON

01:35:18 THE MARKET.

01:35:26 WE HAVE BASICALLY GOING INTO SERVICE GROWTH.

01:35:27 IT IS VERY EXCITING. IT IS A PLATFORM.

01:35:33 I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GETTING THEIR HEAD AROUND WHAT

01:35:41 IT LOOKS LIKE.

01:35:44 WE HAVE COVERED WALKING.

01:35:50 POSITIVE.

01:35:51 THEY USE THAT GENE. WE ARE USING INFORMATION

01:35:58 TECHNOLOGY. I THINK IT WILL BE GOOD.

01:36:05 JONATHAN: YOU CHIEF OFFICER IS LEAVING.

01:36:07 WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING TO DO DIFFERENTLY?

01:36:18 >> WE HAVE EVOLVED AND WE HAVE -- THE GOLDBERGER NEED THE 24

01:36:20 AND 2025 IS SALES. THE SALES TEAM IS SWEATING WHAT

01:36:25 WE ARE DOING. WE WANT TO GROW THE MARKET AND

01:36:29 GAIN MORE MARKET SHARE. I BELIEVE WE HAVE THE BEST

01:36:34 PRODUCT. THE BIG NEWS TODAY ON THE

01:36:41 MARKET -- IT IS VERY CUMBERSOME FOR PHARMACIES TO PREPARE.

01:36:44 WE WOULD BE THE ONLY PRODUCT ON THE MARKET.

01:36:50 WE HAVE STRIKES BECAUSE IT IS SO HARD FOR THOSE THE PHARMACY.

01:36:56 WE ARE WORKING ON ALL OF THOSE THINGS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:36:58 DRIVE SALES GROWTH. JONATHAN:

01:37:06 YOU'VE RUN QUITE A POLARIZING COMPANY, CELEBRATING TREMENDOUS

01:37:09 ELEVATION, BUT THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A DEGREE OF

01:37:13 RESENTMENT TOWARDS COUNTRIES THAT BENEFITED FROM THE POLICY

01:37:18 THAT PUSHED PEOPLE TO TAKE YOUR PRODUCTS.

01:37:19 IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU NEED TO REPAIR?

01:37:26 >> WE WORKED TIRELESSLY, SEVEN DAYS A WEEK TO GET THE VACCINE

01:37:28 OUT. IT HAS BEEN SHOWN BY SEVERAL

01:37:35 PUBLIC HEALTH ANALYSTS THAT WE SAVED LIVES AROUND THE WORLD.

01:37:39 BUT THE POLICY OFFICIAL DECIDED TO DO AROUND THE WORLD WAS NOT

01:37:42 THE COMPANY'S DECISION BUT GOVERNMENT.

01:37:48 I THINK WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON LIVES.

01:37:53 IT HELPED ALL OF US TO GO BACK INTO THE REAL WORLD WITH KIDS

01:37:59 GOING BACK TO SCHOOL , NOT WORRYING ABOUT PARENTS

01:38:03 ARE FRIENDS WHO HAD DISEASES. WE ARE WORKING ON CANCER.

01:38:04 JONATHAN: WE APPRECIATE YOUR UPDATE AND

01:38:08 LOOKING FORWARD TO MORE TO COME IN THE COMING YEAR.

01:38:13 WE ARE LEAVING THE PANDEMIC BEHIND US IN THE WORLD

01:38:14 CONTINUES TO NORMALIZE. MODERNA, BEFORE TODAY, THIRD

01:38:19 WORST PERFORMER ON THE S&P 500. TOM:

01:38:23 PFIZER WAS THE SAME THING AS WELL.

01:38:25 IT IS FASCINATING, THE STRUGGLE OF HER CANCER.

01:38:30 MRNA WAS A HOPE AND DREAM 20 YEARS AGO. AND IT WORKED.

01:38:35 AND WE WILL DO THE SAME THING WITH CANCER. JONATHAN:

01:38:40 COUNTING DOWN TO THAT ECB DECISION.

01:38:42 THE ECB DECISION IS UP NEXT.

01:38:59 The question of when it will become appropriate to dial back

01:39:03 the policy THIS IS CLEARLY A TOPIC OF DISCUSSION.

01:39:13 WE HAVE HAD DECENT GROWTH, UNEMPLOYMENT IS STABLE AND THAT

01:39:16 IS BASICALLY AS GOOD AS IT CAN GET. THIS IS A GREEN LIGHT FOR

01:39:23 INVESTORS UNTIL WE GET A NEW ROUND OF ECONOMIC DATA.

01:39:27 I WOULD BE INCLINED TO GO THE OTHER WAY.

01:39:32 THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE WITH TOM KEENE, JONATHAN FERRO

01:39:33 AND LISA ABRAMOWICZ. TOM:

01:39:41 THE DAY AFTER THE SAID MEETING MINUTES AFTER A BANK OF ENGLAND

01:39:45 MEETING AND ONTO THE ECB.

01:39:51 HISTORY IS BEING MADE THE

01:39:58 RUSSELL 2000 PRINTING 2000, UP 1.25%, UP 18% SINCE HALLOWEEN.

01:40:00 JONATHAN: EVERY TIMELINE IS AMAZING.

01:40:09 WE ARE TALKING ABOUT EASING IN THE TIMING OF EASING.

01:40:19 A GOOD QUESTION GOING IN TO TODAY, THERE IS A HUGE RALLY IN

01:40:21 THE BOND MARKET AND THE RALLY CONTINUES.

01:40:28 EQUITY FUTURES ARE DOWN, YIELDS ARE LOWER AT 430.

01:40:31 WE HAVE BROKEN 4% ON THE 10 YEAR. AT 4.93.

01:40:37 TOM: THE SHOCK YESTERDAY IT GAVE ME

01:40:43 PAUSE TO SEE A 6-3 VOTE IN ENGLAND AT A DIFFERENT TONE

01:40:48 FROM BANK OF ENGLAND. WHAT IS THIS TELL LAGARDE?

01:40:51 SHOULD THEY RAISE THE RATES TODAY? JONATHAN:

01:40:56 YESTERDAY YOU GET HOME AND LOOK AT THE MOVES IN THINK WE ARE

01:41:02 ABOUT TO GET A CENTRAL BANKING PIVOT, THE FED, ECB AND THEN

01:41:11 THE BOE STILL PUTTING UP THEIR HAND SAYING THEY WANT TO RAISE

01:41:12 THEIR RATES AGAIN.

01:41:23 AND THEY ARE GETTING PUSHBACK FROM CHRISTINE LAGARDE.

01:41:26 WHAT WILL SHE DO? WE SAW FROM CHAIRMAN POWELL

01:41:27 YESTERDAY. HAS SHE BEEN GIVEN THE ROOM TO

01:41:30 DO IT? TOM:

01:41:34 WHAT DOES THE PRICE AND YIELD TELUS FOR THE FIXED INCOME

01:41:49 MARKET?

01:41:50 THE INFLATION ADJUSTED 10 YEAR YIELD REACHED A NEW YEAR LOW.

01:41:54 LISA: AND IT IS SCREAMING VICTORY

01:41:58 WHICH IS THE KEY QUESTION, HOW LONG CAN IT LAST?

01:42:02 I WAS LOOKING AT INVESTMENT-GRADE BOND YIELDS

01:42:06 DROPPING THE MOST YESTERDAY SINCE NOVEMBER 2022.

01:42:11 YOU ARE LOOKING AT A YIELD JUST ABOVE 5% GOING BACK TO A LEVEL

01:42:14 THAT WAS COMPARABLE TO WHERE WE WERE NOT LONG AGO.

01:42:21 THIS RAISES THE QUESTION, DOES THIS MAKE A SOFT LANDING EASIER?

01:42:26 TOM: 12 MINUTES AWAY FROM THIS

01:42:32 DECISION THE CEOS OF THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, WILL THEY

01:42:33 ISSUE MORE PAPER.

01:42:43 JONATHAN: I AM PLEASED THAT YOU BROUGHT

01:42:47 UP THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, MICROSOFT NOT PARTICIPATING IN

01:42:51 THIS RALLY IN YESTERDAY'S SESSION. THIS WAS NOT ABOUT THE

01:42:53 DOMINANCE OF BIG TECH.

01:43:00 WE HAVE STARTED TO SEE BANKS PARTICIPATE AND PEOPLE GET MORE

01:43:02 HOPEFUL FOR THE OUTLOOK FOR GROWTH NEXT YEAR.

01:43:10 IS IT ANYTHING MORE THE BONDS HELPING THE BIG BANKS TAKE

01:43:14 THEIR KNOCKS? TOM: THE VIX IS IT 12.04.

01:43:20 I THINK IT'S A BULL MARKET? JONATHAN:

01:43:25 GOVERNOR BAILEY SAYING IT'S TOO EARLY TO SPECULATE ON RATES.

01:43:30 THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE U.S.

01:43:35 AND THE BANK OF ENGLAND.

01:43:38 1.09 ON THE EURO, YIELDS ARE LOWER BY SEVEN BASIS POINTS AT

01:43:41 3.9432.

01:43:47 WE ARE UP .39 ON THE S&P. TOM:

01:43:54 THIS IS SOMETHING I THOUGHT ABOUT YESTERDAY, IF YOU BELIEVE

01:43:56 IN THE LITMUS PAPER OF THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET, THE

01:44:00 CROSS RATES, THE DIFFERENT CURRENCY PAIRS OUT THERE.

01:44:08 HE IS THE HEAD OF RESEARCH AT STANDARD CHARTERED.

01:44:12 YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT CURRENCY PAIRS, WHICH CURRENCY PAIRS

01:44:17 SHOULD OUR VIEWERS AND LISTENERS FOLLOW TO TRY AND

01:44:18 MAKE SENSE OF THE STOCKS?

01:44:27 STEVEN: IS A VERY BROAD MOOD THEY CAN

01:44:30 GET A GOOD SENSE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING BUT WHAT I'M ALSO

01:44:33 SEEING AS THERE IS A LOT OF INTEREST AGAIN AS THE RATE GAP

01:44:39 NARROWS AND CAPITAL FLOWS MAY BE SHIFTING THEY ARE LOOKING AT

01:44:43 IT DIFFERENTLY THAN THEY WERE EVEN A FEW MONTHS AGO. TOM:

01:44:49 I LOOK AT THE DOLLAR-YEN, I WON'T GO INTO THE DETAILS.

01:44:54 IT'S AN EXCEPTIONALLY ELEGANT CHART. AS THE MARKET TELLING THE

01:45:00 INSTITUTIONS OF JAPAN WHAT TO DO OR WILL THE INSTITUTION

01:45:02 STILL THE MARKET WHAT TO DO? STEVEN:

01:45:08 THE BOJ HAS DONE A GOOD JOB OF WRITING ITS MONETARY POLICY

01:45:12 CONTAINING EXACTLY WHAT IT WANTS TO DO AND WHAT IT WANTS

01:45:15 THE MARKET TO DO. THE FED IS CLEARLY HELPING THE

01:45:18 YEN. IT IS GOING THE YEN'S WAY.

01:45:26 THE JAPANESE ECONOMY LOOKS A LITTLE BETTER IN YOUR SEEING

01:45:29 INTEREST IN THE CAPITAL FLOWS INTO JAPAN THIS WELL.

01:45:34 WHEN EVERYTHING IS GOING YOUR WAY, THINGS MAY GO YOUR WAY IN

01:45:40 A BIG WAY. JONATHAN:

01:45:42 YOU WROTE THE CHAIRMAN POWELL IS GIVING CHRISTINE LAGARDE

01:45:43 SOME ROOM TODAY. HE HAS OPEN THE DOOR, DID SHE

01:45:45 WALK THROUGH IT? STEVEN: THAT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION.

01:45:52 I THINK THE ECB FORECAST IN THE

01:45:58 WAY THEY PREVENT THEMSELVES -- PRESENT THEMSELVES AS STAGE.

01:46:04 THERE IS A RISK AND WE WILL SEE IN A FEW MINUTES, IF THE ECB

01:46:14 DOES NOT ALTER ITS FO RCAST. WE WON'T DO MUCH UNTIL

01:46:19 2025.

01:46:25 I WOULD SUSPECT THEY WOULD

01:46:32 PREFER FOR THE EURO TO RELAX FROM THESE LEVELS.

01:46:43 THE U.S. ECONOMIC DATA HAVE BEEN FLIRTING WITH RECESSION BUT

01:46:47 NEVER WALKED INTO THE DOOR.

01:46:54 THE EUROPEAN DATA ARE IN A RECESSION EXCEPT FOR THE LABOR

01:46:55 MARKET WHICH IS BLACK BUT LAGGING.

01:47:00 EUROPEAN INFLATION NUMBERS HAVE COME DOWN SHARPLY BUT ONLY IN

01:47:04 THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS AND THAT MAY NOT BE ENOUGH.

01:47:09 IF THEY ARE RETICENT AT ALL, I THINK THE MARKETS WILL SEE THAT

01:47:10 AS AN INDICATION AS THEY EMPHASIZE THE DOWN SIDE AND

01:47:17 LEAVE OPEN THE DOOR FOR RATE MOVES SOONER THAN THE INDICATED

01:47:25 EARLIER.

01:47:25 THERE IS NO REASON FOR THE EURO TO UNDERPERFORM, CERTAINLY

01:47:28 OTHER G10 CURRENCIES.

01:47:36 LISA: HOW RETICENT ARE THEY TO THE

01:47:39 IDEA OF FOLLOWING JAY POWELL? STEVEN:

01:47:46 THEY HAVE THEIR OWN CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE INFLATION

01:47:48 WAGE DYNAMIC IS DIFFERENT IN EUROPE THAN IT IS IN THE U.S..

01:47:56 EVEN WITHIN THE ECB I SUSPECT THE DISCUSSION WOULD HAVE BEEN

01:48:03 DO WE WAIT ANOTHER SIX MONTHS BEFORE THIS INFLATION HAS

01:48:05 CONSOLIDATED TO THE DOWNSIDE? SEE MORE SCIENCE THAT THE LABOR

01:48:10 MARKET IS SOFTENING? THEY MAY BE TEMPTED TO MOVE IT

01:48:14 UP A LITTLE BIT.

01:48:17 THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS HAVE BEEN VERY PROMISING, LOWER THAN

01:48:24 THE U.S.. THEY CAN WALK THROUGH THE DOOR

01:48:27 IF THEY WANT TO.

01:48:39 LISA: IF THE ECB DOES NOT FOLLOW THE

01:48:44 FED, PEOPLE GET REALLY WORRIED ABOUT AN EVEN DEEPER RECESSION

01:48:45 AND IT WILL BE NEGATIVE FOR THE EURO? STEVEN:

01:48:50 IT IS POSSIBLE BUT THAT IS GOING TO BE LAGARDE'S JOB IN

01:48:54 THE PRESS CONFERENCE TO MAKE SURE A NO ONE GETS THE WRONG

01:48:59 IMPRESSION.

01:49:06 GIVEN ALL THE INFORMATION THAT THEY HAVE RIGHT NOW.

01:49:09 I WOULD SAY THE LAST INFLATION NUMBERS LOOK VERY HIGH GIVEN

01:49:13 WHAT HAS HAPPENED. THE FIRST THING I WOULD LOOK AT

01:49:17 IS HOW THEY ARE MARKED DOWN. TOM: IS NOT AN EASY CALL.

01:49:24 CHINA IS THE WILDCARD.

01:49:36 WHAT DOES THE ENGLANDER CALL FOR CHINA

01:49:40 IN THE NEXT YEAR? STEVEN:

01:49:49 THERE'S A LOT OF -- TO POLICYMAKERS, THEY

01:49:55 PUSHED THINGS TOO FAR IN THE PAST AND HAVE REGRETTED IT SO

01:49:59 THEY MAY WANT TO GO SLOWER. AS FAR AS CNH, WE HAVE SEEN IT

01:50:03 RELATIVELY STABLE. IT IS NOT GOING TO BE A LEADER

01:50:11 AGAINST THE DOLLAR BUT THEY WILL WELCOME OTHER CURRENCIES

01:50:15 ARE APPRECIATING AGAINST THE DOLLAR.

01:50:21 JONATHAN: ECB, FEDERAL RESERVE, FIRST CUT?

01:50:26 YESTERDAY IT WAS ECB, WHAT'S THE ANSWER NOW? STEVEN:

01:50:32 I THINK IT MAKES MORE SENSE THAT THE ECB CUTS FIRST BECAUSE

01:50:39 THEIR ECONOMICS OR WORS E. WE WILL HAVE TO SEE WHETHER

01:50:41 THEY CHOOSE THAT WAY. THE FED HAS ALWAYS BEEN MORE

01:50:47 AGGRESSIVE IN HIS REACTIONS TO THE ECB. JONATHAN:

01:50:50 STEVE, THANK YOU BUDDY. IT WAS GOOD TO CHECK UP.

01:50:59 STEVE ENGLANDER, THANK YOU. THE FED IS GOING TO HOLD ON AND

01:51:04 START CUTTING IN JUNE. JUST LIKE THAT. LISA:

01:51:10 WHAT'S A CALENDAR FOR THE ECB TO GET AHEAD OF THE FED?

01:51:12 WHEN WOULD THEY HAVE TO CUT? THIS IS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WE

01:51:16 WERE HEARING FROM THE PEOPLE.

01:51:22 THE TIMELINE. TOM: THEY DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY OF

01:51:27 GETTING AHEAD. FORGET ABOUT THE WAR, FINLAND,

01:51:32 ALL THE OTHER POLITICS. THEY DON'T HAVE THE VIBRANCY IN

01:51:39 THE ECONOMY, THEY ARE IN SOME SORT OF RECESSION THERE.

01:51:42 I DON'T THINK THE ANALOG COMPARISON IS THERE. JONATHAN:

01:51:50 LET'S GET A PREV IEW AND CHECKUP WITH MARIA

01:51:52 TADEO. WHAT ARE YOU EXPECTING TODAY?

01:52:00 MARIA: THOSE LIKE ICE HAS CHANGED HERE

01:52:02 IN THE PAST TWO WEEKS, ESPECIALLY YESTERDAY WITH THE

01:52:05 FED AND THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR THE ECB WHEN THEY HAVE A

01:52:09 MONETARY POLICY DECISION THEY KNOW THAT A LOT OF THE COMFORT

01:52:16 -- AND CONVERSATION WILL CHANGE. THEY TALKED ABOUT THIS HIGHER

01:52:24 FOR LONGER NARRATIVE AND THAT HAS CHANGED INTO CUTTING RATES

01:52:27 WHICH IS A QUESTION SHE WILL BE ASKED AND IT'S INTERESTING TO

01:52:31 SEE IF SHE CAN SEE THAT THERE IS A PIVOT THAT THEY'RE TRYING

01:52:37 TO LIVE WITH.

01:52:38 THIS IDEA OF A MARCH CUT IF THE ECONOMY DETERIORATES IS NOT

01:52:43 EVEN A POSSIBILITY.

01:52:44 CAN SHE BE IN A POSITION WHERE THAT IS EVEN CREDIBLE? LISA:

01:52:50 ARE THERE WHISPERS FROM THE BANK ABOUT HOW MUCH PUSHBACK

01:52:57 THERE WOULD B BANK ABOUT BECAUSE?

01:53:04 MARIA: THE DECISION WILL BE MADE AND

01:53:09 NOW IT'S ABOUT FINE-TUNING THE PRESS CONFERENCE.

01:53:11 THERE ARE MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNING COUNCIL BEYOND

01:53:15 GERMANY BUT INCLUDING GERMANY THAT WOULD BE CAUTIOUS AND

01:53:18 WORRIED ABOUT THE IDEA OF EARLY BECAUSE THEY COULD UNDO THE

01:53:21 WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE OVER THE PAST YEAR.

01:53:28 THEY WANT TO GET INFLATION BACK TO 2% WHICH IS WHY THE FORECAST

01:53:31 WILL MATTER BUT IF YOU ASK THE GERMAN CENTRAL BANK IF YOU'RE

01:53:35 IN A POSITION TO CUT THEY WOULD SAY ABSOLUTELY NOT. JONATHAN:

01:53:49 DID THE GERMAN BANKS SEEM ANGRY AS HE WAS WALKING AWAY?

01:53:55 IN THE EQUITY MARKET, EQUITY FUTURES ARE STILL POSITIVE

01:54:00 STATESIDE. FOR THE EURO WE ARE POSITIVE.

01:54:04 WE WILL GET A TON OF HEADLINES BUT RATES ARE UNCHANGED AT 4.5.

01:54:14 THE DEPOSIT RATE IS AT 4%. UNCHANGED WITH A TON OF

01:54:17 HEADLINES TO GET TO. LISA: INFLATION HAS DROPPED IN THE

01:54:21 ECB IS EMPHASIZING THAT GIVES YOU A SENSE OF WHERE THE

01:54:26 NARRATIVE IS. THEY SAY THE RATE SHOULD BE

01:54:29 MAINTAINED FOR A LONG TIME WHICH IS PUSHING BACK AGAINST

01:54:31 WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE FED. THIS IS GOING TO STAND OUT,

01:54:38 INFLATION IS LIKELY TO PICK UP NEAR TERM WHICH IS THE QUESTION

01:54:42 IF YOU SEE THAT HAPPENING, DO THEY HAVE THE SAME LUXURY OF

01:54:48 PULLING A POWELL AND HAVING A PIVOT TOWARDS RATE CUTS?

01:54:52 JONATHAN: THE GOVERNING COUNCIL DECIDED

01:54:55 TO KEEP THE THREE KEY INTEREST RATES UNCHANGED WHILE INFLATION

01:54:59 HAS DROPPED IS LIKELY TO PICK UP AGAIN TEMPORARILY IN THE

01:55:00 NEAR TERM.

01:55:13 ACCORDING TO THE LATEST EXPECTATIONS

01:55:19 , INFLATION IS EXPECTED TO DECLINE AVERAGING 5.4 IN 2023,

01:55:28 2 .7 AND 24, AND FOR 2020 61 .9 COMPARED TO THE STOP

01:55:34 PROJECTIONS THIS IS A DOWNWARD PROVISION FOR 2023 AND 2024.

01:55:39 THE INTEREST RATE INCREASES HAVE BEEN TRANSMITTED

01:55:43 FORCEFULLY TO THE ECONOMY, DAMPENING DEMAND HELPING TO

01:55:44 PUSH DOWN INFLATION. THEY EXPECT ECONOMIC GROWTH

01:55:52 SUBDUED IN THE NEAR FUTURE BUT WILL RECOVER BECAUSE OF RISING

01:55:53 REAL INCOMES. THEY SEEK GROWTH PICKING UP.

01:56:04 HERE IS THE CALL FOR GDP, ONE POINT 5% FOR 25 AND 26.

01:56:09 HERE IS THE COMMITMENT FROM THE GOVERNING COUNCIL TO ENSURE

01:56:10 THAT INFLATION RETURNS TO ITS 2% MEDIAN IN A TIMELY MANNER.

01:56:17 THE GOVERNING COUNCIL CONSIDERS

01:56:23 THE KEY INTEREST RATES MAINTAINED AT THESE LEVELS WILL

01:56:24 MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO THIS GOAL.

01:56:29 FUTURE DECISIONS WILL ENSURE THE POLICY RATES WILL BE SET AT

01:56:31 RESTRICTIVE LEVELS FOR AS LONG AS NECESSARY.

01:56:37 AS I CONTINUE TO READ THIS STATEMENT, I DON'T HEAR

01:56:41 CHAIRMAN POWELL IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE ECB THIS MORNING.

01:56:49 MARIA: IF ANYONE WAS EXPECTING IN THE

01:56:54 ECB THAT WOULD ANCHOR ONTO THE WORDS OF THE FED YESTERDAY.

01:56:55 THAT'S NOT THE CASE. THEY WANT TO BRIDGE THEIR

01:56:59 TARGET BY 2025. THAT'S NEARLY TWO YEARS FROM

01:57:04 NOW. SUFFICIENTLY RESTRICTIVE BUT

01:57:07 THE QUESTION WILL BE WHAT'S RESTRICTIVE?

01:57:12 IF YOU BELIEVE THAT THIS WOULD BE AN ECB THAT WOULD PROVIDE A

01:57:14 PLATFORM TO PIVOT YOU DON'T SEE THAT IN THE STATEMENT.

01:57:22 THE QUESTION NOW IS THE PRESS CONFERENCE AND SHE WILL BE

01:57:25 ASKED MANY TIMES, WHAT ABOUT CUTS?

01:57:26 BUT THERE IS NOTHING THAT WOULD SUGGEST THAT THIS IS AN ECB

01:57:29 THAT WANTS TO FOLLOW THE FED. THEY HAVE ALWAYS SAID THEY'RE

01:57:33 NOT FED DEPENDABLE WILL LOOK AT THE DATA. TOM:

01:57:41 THIS IS A CLEAR STATEMENT OF NOMINAL GDP, DARE I SAY THEY

01:57:44 FRAME IT OUT WITH SOME PROBABILITY, NOMINAL GDP.

01:57:49 WITH ALL OF YOUR WONDERFUL REPORTING FROM BRUSSELS, HAS

01:57:55 EUROPE ESCAPED DOUBLE-DIGIT UNEMPLOYMENT OR A PERCENT

01:58:00 UNEMPLOYMENT? IS IT A BETTER EMPLOYED EUROPE

01:58:04 GIVEN THE LOUSY NOMINAL GDP? OR ARE THEY GOING BACK TO WHAT

01:58:06 THEY KNEW YEARS AGO? MARIA: YOU SEE AN ECONOMY THAT HAS

01:58:12 GONE THROUGH SO MANY CHALLENGES BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

01:58:15 UNEMPLOYMENT DATA YOU SEE THAT IT CONTINUES TO DO WELL.

01:58:19 WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS MANY TIMES.

01:58:26 BUT GOING BACK TO THE QUESTION OF GDP, THE ECB HAS BEEN

01:58:30 CRITICIZED FOR BEING TOO OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE RESILIENCE

01:58:34 OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMY AND LOOKING IN INFLATION IN A WAY

01:58:39 WHERE THEY DON'T BELIEVE IT SLOW AND FAST ENOUGH.

01:58:47 WHEN IT COMES TO GDP AND GROWTH THE ECB IS TOO OPTIMISTIC.

01:58:51 IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF THEY SEE THAT MANIFESTING IN

01:58:54 THE NEXT FEW YEARS BUT THE CRITICISM, THE LOGIC FOR EARLY

01:58:58 CUT IS THAT THE ECONOMY IS DOING WORSE THAN WHAT THE ECB

01:59:01 BELIEVES IT'S DOING. JONATHAN: WE WILL CATCH UP WITH YOU

01:59:05 FOLLOWING THE PRESS CONFERENCE. THAT NEWS CONFERENCE IN 25

01:59:15 MINUTES WITH ECB PRESIDENT, CHRISTINE LAGARDE.

01:59:19 GUILDS ARE STILL LOWER ON THE SESSION BY 12 BASIS POINTS, THE

01:59:24 EURO IS STILL STRONGER AGAINST THE DOLLAR AT 4.5.

01:59:29 WHEN YOU READ THROUGH THE GOVERNOR'S LANGUAGE WHAT I HEAR

01:59:32 IS HOLD. I DON'T HEAR THE CONVERSATION

01:59:36 ABOUT CUTTING THAT WE HEARD FROM CHAIRMAN POWELL.

01:59:40 THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY SO LET'S NOT PREJUDGE THE NEWS

01:59:42 CONFERENCE BUT BASED ON WHAT WE HAVE READ.

01:59:46 IT'S NOT A REPEAT OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE. LISA:

01:59:53 HIGHER FOR LONGER WAS NOT THE LANGUAGE THE FED WAS USING.

02:00:00 TO ME, WILL THE PRESS CONFERENCE HAVE A DIFFERENT

02:00:02 TONE AS THEY RACED TO ADAPT TO A MARKET THAT HAS CHANGED? TOM:

02:00:06 LET'S SUMMARIZE THIS TOGETHER. THERE WAS A BOOK YEARS AGO,

02:00:11 FLYING ON ONE ENGINE.

02:00:17 IT WAS A GLOBAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIST AND SHE GAVE US A

02:00:22 WONDERFUL IMAGE SUMMING UP THE FED, ECB, BANK OF ENGLAND AND

02:00:25 14 OTHER CENTRAL BANKS ABOUT INVESTMENT STRATEGY INTO 2024.

02:00:30 SOMEBODY HAS TO LAND THE PLANE.

02:00:36 AFTER WE SAW THE TURBULENCE AT 2:00, OR THIS MORNING.

02:00:41 HOW CAN WE LAND THE PLANE GIVEN THE INSTABILITY OF THE LAST 24

02:00:52 HOURS?

02:00:53 ELYSE: IT'S NO SURPRISE TO US THAT

02:01:00 THE B.O.B AND ECB IS ON HOLD AND WE THINK THE ECB IS THE

02:01:05 OBVIOUS CANDIDATE TO DELIVER THE FIRST CUT IN LIGHT OF THE

02:01:06 ECONOMIC WEAKNESS YOU'RE SEEING. LISA:

02:01:12 THIS IS AN INTERESTING POINT. I WOULD EXPECT THE EURO TO

02:01:16 STRENGTHEN DRAMATIC ON THE HEELS OF THIS IN RESPONSE TO A

02:01:20 MORE HAWKISH ECB THAN PEOPLE EXPECTED.

02:01:22 ARE YOU SAYING YOU DON'T BELIEVE THEM? ELYSE:

02:01:28 I THINK THE ECB HAS TO CONTINUE TO HOLD A HAWKISH POSTURE GIVEN

02:01:33 THAT WAGE GROWTH HAS NOT ROLLED OVER IN A CONVINCING WAY.

02:01:39 GIVEN THE ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN AND NASCENT SIGNS OF ECONOMIC LIFE

02:01:43 COMING BACK I THINK THE ECB WILL BE THE FIRST TO CUT IN THE

02:01:45 SPRING. JONATHAN:

02:01:56 YESTERDAY BEFORE CHAIRMAN POWELL, WHY DOES THE ECB NOT

02:01:58 FEEL AS CREDIBLE KNOWING WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE ECONOMY?

02:02:04 ELYSE: WE ARE HAVING CONVERSATIONS

02:02:07 ABOUT THIS ON THE FLOOR YESTERDAY.

02:02:09 WHAT WE LEARN FROM THE FED IS WE HAVE TO START ENTERTAINING

02:02:14 ARE BOTH CASE A LITTLE MORE. WE CAME INTO THE DECISION ON

02:02:18 THE FRONT FOOT AND ENCOURAGING

02:02:24 INVESTORS TO ADD BACK RISK EXPOSURE AND THIS UNDERWRITES

02:02:26 OUR CALL. JONATHAN: WHAT IS THE BULL CASE?

02:02:33 LISA: THE S&P ENDS UP BEFORE 5000.

02:02:41 ELYSE: BUT WE EXPECT THAT AT THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.

02:02:48 JONATHAN: IS THERE A RISK WE COULD BE

02:02:50 THERE IN JANUARY BASED ON WHAT WERE SAYING? ELYSE:

02:02:56 I THINK JANUARY FEELS AGGRESSIVE.

02:02:58 WE HAVE TO SEE EARNINGS COME THROUGH AND WE ARE MAKING THE

02:03:01 CALL THAT THE EARNINGS RECESSION IS OVER AND WE WILL

02:03:05 SEE ROLLING EARNINGS RECOVERIES BUT LET'S GET THROUGH THE

02:03:07 FOURTH QUARTER REPORTING SEASON. JONATHAN:

02:03:14 IS EQUAL WEIGHTED AND NOT MARKET CAP WEIGHTED? ELYSE:

02:03:18 WE WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE EXPOSURE TO ALL 493 IN THE

02:03:24 INDEX BUT WE ARE CONSTRUCTED ON THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN.

02:03:28 THEY ARE EXPECTED TO GROW MORE THAN 20% IN 2024 AND THAT'S AN

02:03:34 EXPOSURE WERE ENCOURAGING INVESTORS TO INVEST IN. TOM:

02:03:41 WE'VE NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE, 6 TRILLION IN CASH, WHAT HAPPENS?

02:03:45 ELYSE: BONDS ARE BACK ON THE TABLE.

02:03:49 THERE IS STILL A TRADE TO STEP INTO SOME DURATION AND NOT PLOW

02:03:52 INTO THE EQUITY MARKET. SOME FOLKS WILL REMAIN RETICENT

02:03:56 GIVEN WHERE VALUATIONS ARE TODAY.

02:04:02 BUT GIVEN THE CASH FLOW RELATIVE TO 10 YEARS AGO WHERE

02:04:04 COMFORTABLE WITH TODAY'S VALUATIONS BUT WE DON'T THINK

02:04:08 THAT WILL DRIVE THE UPSIDE IN THE NEXT MONTHS. JONATHAN:

02:04:13 THANK YOU FOR COMING IN.

02:04:20 FOLLOWING THE CENTRAL BANKS REPORTS.

02:04:33 COMING UP, WE WILL HEAR FROM ALESSIA DELONGIS.

02:04:41 THE RALLY CONTINUES, S&P POSITIVE, JOBLESS CLAIMS,

02:04:45 RESALE SALES, THOSE ARE UP NEXT.

02:05:03 TOM: BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE, HOW TO

02:05:10 SYNTHESIZE ALL WE HAVE SEEN THIS TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY?

02:05:16 IT IS HAPPENING IN REAL TIME, BUT IN 10 SECONDS HERE.

02:05:19 WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT CLAIMS OR RETAIL SALES? LISA:

02:05:23 RETAIL SALES, HEADING INTO THE HOLIDAY WHERE CONSUMERS ARE

02:05:28 STARTING TO PUSH BACK. TOM: HERE IS THE QUESTION WITH THE

02:05:33 CHAIRMAN PAUSE. AND WE WILL PAUSE AS HE TELLS

02:05:38 US ABOUT THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. MICHAEL:

02:05:45 IT SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE STRONGER THAN ANTICIPATED AS

02:05:49 RETAIL SALES RISE .3% AFTER A REVISED 2% DOWN IN OCTOBER.

02:05:56 TAKE OUT AUTOS AND IT'S UP TO TENTS.

02:06:00 YOU TAKE OUT AUTOS AND GAS AND WERE UP 6/10.

02:06:07 GAS ALWAYS THE DRIVER, DROPPING AWAY FROM THE LOWER PRICES

02:06:13 WE'VE SEEN.

02:06:15 RETAIL CONTROL COMES IN STRONGER-THAN-EXPECTED, OF 4/10.

02:06:21 THE EXPECTATION WAS FOR HER TO TENTS RISE. -- .2 PERCENT RISE.

02:06:36 JOBLESS CLAIMS, 202,000, WITH NO JOBLESS CLAIMS LAST WEEK.

02:06:37 THAT IS DOWN FROM THE MONTH BEFORE.

02:06:46 OVERALL, CONTINUING CLAIMS NUMBER

02:06:50 AND FINALLY WE HAVE IMPORT PRICES DOWN 4/10.

02:07:21 WE HAVE ANOTHER GDP NUMBER AND

02:07:27 IT WAS A 1.2% AND THAT WILL HAVE APPLICATIONS FOR THE

02:07:28 MARKETS IN TERMS OF PRICING. BUT THEY THINK THE FED IS GOING

02:07:35 TO DO

02:07:54 . TOM: THANK YOU SO MUCH, AFTER WHAT

02:08:02 WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST 18 HOURS A MODEST GIVEBACK AND I THOUGHT

02:08:08 EQUITIES WOULD GO DOWN A LITTLE BIT.

02:08:12 THEY SHOW THE PERSISTENCY OF A NICELY EMPLOYED AMERICA. LISA:

02:08:17 WE WERE EXPECTING A BIGGER MOVE, ONE THAT WE BELIEVED IN

02:08:19 THE DATA DEPENDENT FEDERAL RESERVE.

02:08:24 EVIDENTLY, PEOPLE DON'T THINK THIS FED IS AS DATA DEPENDENT

02:08:29 BECAUSE WE SAW STRONGER-THAN-EXPECTED RETAIL

02:08:36 SALES AND AFTER THIS TREMENDOUS VOLUME, IT TELLS YOU THE

02:08:38 NARRATIVE HAS SHIFTED SO HARD WITH THE IDEA THAT THE FED'S

02:08:41 GOAL IS TO CUT RATES SOONER RATHER THAN LATER HAS PERMEATED

02:08:43 EVERYTHING. TOM:

02:08:52 2.37 FROM A 5%, THE CHANGES THAT THEY HAVE WROUGHT.

02:09:00 THE 10 YEAR YIELD UP TO THE BRAMMO LEVEL.

02:09:12 TWO HOURS WE WENT OFF AIR, THERE IS A LITTLE EBB IN THE

02:09:16 BOND MARKET. I WILL LEAVE

02:09:52 IT WITH CURRENCY IT WITH CURRENCY WEAKNESS.

02:09:58 STEPHANIE ROTH HAD A VERY BUSY WEEKEND.

02:10:05 LISA: THEY ARE REALLY LEANING INTO

02:10:08 THE SOFT LANDING NARRATIVE. DO YOU HAVE A MORE OPTIMISTIC

02:10:11 VIEW THEY CAN ACHIEVE A SOFT LANDING AFTER YESTERDAY?

02:10:14 THEN THE DAY BEFORE?

02:10:19 >> I JUST HAVE MORE CONVICTION IN A SOFT LANDING.

02:10:25 OUR BASE CASE WAS Q3 OF NEXT YEAR AND HEADING INTO YESTERDAY

02:10:30 WE POSTED INTO Q2 AND THAT MAKES THE RUNWAY EVEN WIDER

02:10:35 FOR A SOFT LANDING. LISA:

02:10:40 FOR YOU OK WITH HOW CHAIRMAN POWELL RESPONDED TO HIS

02:10:49 QUESTIONS YESTERDAY? STEPHANIE:

02:10:52 HE DID NOT TALK ABOUT MARKET CONDITIONS, FINANCIAL

02:10:54 CONDITIONS BECAUSE THEY FEES. TOM:

02:11:00 I HAVE REALLY FAILED AT THE CORE THEME THAT WAS ALLUDED TO

02:11:05 BY THE CHAIRMAN WE WILL GO TO MICHAEL MCKEE BEFORE WE GET TO

02:11:07 CHRISTINE LAGARDE IN FRANKFURT. YOU'RE QUITE GOOD AT THIS WHICH

02:11:14 IS INTERPRETING A FREE RATIO PRODUCTIVITY DYNAMIC OF CAPITAL

02:11:20 AND LABOR AND THE PIXIE DUST OF AMERICAN EFFICIENCY.

02:11:27 HOW WOULD YOU DETERMINE BETTER PRODUCTIVITY?

02:11:30 DO THEY HAVE CONFIDENCE IN PRODUCTIVITY?

02:11:34 STEPHANIE: I THINK THERE IS REAL SCOPE

02:11:38 FOR THAT. THE ECONOMY HAS LEARNED TO

02:11:43 OPERATE WITH YOU WERE WORKERS THAN WHAT THE PRE-COVID TREND

02:11:47 WOULD SUGGEST. TOM: ARE YOU GUESSTIMATING WE

02:11:54 GROSSLY UNDERESTIMATE THE LABOR DYNAMIC?

02:12:01 WITH THE COMMENT ABOUT MORE

02:12:07 UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE MIDDLE AGE BRACKET BUT ARE WE COMPLETELY

02:12:09 UNDERESTIMATING LABOR? STEPHANIE:

02:12:14 THE BIGGEST QUESTION IS THE LABOR SUPPLY.

02:12:21 IT WAS A COMBINATION OF IMMIGRATION AND REENTRY. TOM:

02:12:26 IT'S THE WOMEN COMING BACK INTO THE LABOR MARKET, IS

02:12:32 JAW-DROPPING. LISA: P THESE NUMBERS.

02:12:36 INITIAL JOBLESS CLAIMS CAME IN BELOW EXPECTATION.

02:12:38 THAT'S A GOOD DOWNWARD SURPRISE. RETAIL SALES, MONTH OVER MONTH,

02:12:48 THE CONTROL GROUP CAME IN 0.4% WITH THE EXPECTATION IS 0.2

02:12:51 PERCENT. WHEN YOU STRIP OUT AUTOS AND

02:12:56 GAS, DO YOU GET A SENSE THAT THE CONSUMER IS NOT CRACKING AT

02:12:58 ALL? THEY STILL HAVE MONEY IN REAL

02:13:04 WAGES GOING UP WILL CONTINUE TO FUEL THE SPENDING SPREE

02:13:06 UNDERPINNING THE RECOVERY? STEPHANIE:

02:13:09 THE CONSUMER IS DOING JUST FINE. WE DID GET SOME DOWNWARD

02:13:13 REVISION TO THE PRIOR MONTHS. THE CONSUMER SEEMS FINE.

02:13:22 YOU SEE SOME DELINQUENCIES IN VULNERABLE SPOTS BUT WITH RATES

02:13:25 COMING DOWN AND CONDITIONS EASING, MAYBE THAT'S THE END OF

02:13:28 THAT? LISA: WHAT WOULD YOU SEE TOOK

02:13:31 QUESTION THE SOFT LANDING THESIS?

02:13:34 WHERE WITH THE WEAKNESS COME FROM? STEPHANIE:

02:13:38 THERE ARE TWO THINGS TO WATCH FOR. AS LONG AS CONSUMERS ARE

02:13:43 EMPLOYED THEY WILL KEEP SPENDING BUT THE CRACKS FORMING

02:13:49 WITHIN THE CONSUMER, THAT KEEPS ME LOOKING CLOSELY.

02:13:51 SOME DELINQUENCIES ON THE LOWER AND OUR YOUNGER BORROWERS IT

02:13:57 FEELS VERY LATE CYCLE TO ME. BUT OVERALL, THE CONSUMER FEELS

02:13:58 FINE. TOM:

02:14:04 ALL OF US GOT THE THIRD QUARTER WRONG. WE GOT THE SHOCK OF AN

02:14:09 OPTIMISTIC NUMBER.

02:14:15 WITH THE 3% GDP, 2.8 THOSE ARE GOOD NUMBERS. STEPHANIE:

02:14:19 I THINK WE WILL TRACK AT 2%. TOM: CAN WE GET ABOVE 3%?

02:14:25 LISA: I DON'T THINK SO. TOM:

02:14:31 ON TRADE, THE WILDCARD NEXT YEAR'S CHINA.

02:14:35 THE GREAT QUESTION IS, DO WE UNDERESTIMATE CHINA ONCE AGAIN?

02:14:39 THE EXPORT IMPORT DYNAMIC AS TO GDP? STEPHANIE:

02:14:45 CHINA CAN BE A BIT OF A BOOST I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE

02:14:46 DRAMATIC.

02:14:54 WILL WE END UP WITH CROSS PORT, IMPORT TARIFFS THAT'S A REAL

02:14:56 ISSUE DEPENDING ON THE POLITICAL CYCLE.

02:14:59 EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT RESTORING BUT THERE AREN'T

02:15:03 SIGNS OF IT YET. WERE STILL IMPORTING

02:15:06 DISINFLATION. WERE NOT MANUFACTURING ALL

02:15:08 THESE GOODS HERE. LISA:

02:15:14 WHO WAS MORE RIGHT THE FED PROJECTING THREE RATE CUTS OR

02:15:16 THE MARKET PRICING SIX RATE CUTS? STEPHANIE:

02:15:20 THE FED, AND THUS WE GET A RECESSION. LISA:

02:15:27 THAT SEEMS THE MOST LIKELY BEING LESS THAN WHAT THE MARKET

02:15:28 IS EXPECTING? STEPHANIE: THE MARKET IS NOT PRICING THE

02:15:36 FED GETTING DOWN TO 2.5, 3%. THAT'S WHERE THE REST OF THE

02:15:41 MARKET COULD PRICE TWO. TOM:

02:15:52 STEPHANIE ROTH WAS -- WITH A PERFECT SUMMARY.

02:15:57 WE ARE SO FORTUNATE WITH THE HEAD SPINNING BLUR OF THE FED,

02:16:01 BANK OF ENGLAND, ECB TO HAVE WITH US MICHAEL MCKEE.

02:16:06 HE JOINS US NOW AS WE GO TO CHRISTINE LAGARDE.

02:16:10 I MADE FUN OF IT YESTERDAY I HAD USED OF SILVER WHAT WAS

02:16:14 GOING ON IN YOUR PRESS CONFERENCE.

02:16:17 IT'S ALMOST HISTORIC TIMES. WHY ARE WE SEEING THIS WITH

02:16:22 POWELL, BAILEY AND LAGARDE? MIKE:

02:16:28 I THINK WHAT IS HAPPENING IS WE'RE SEEI
