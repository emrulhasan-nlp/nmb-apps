The US always matters to Europe, but seldom more so than now. An acute fear stalks the continent: that Donald Trump might be America’s president for a second time. Ivo Daalder, a former US ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, told the New York Times that Europeans are “deeply, deeply concerned about the 2024 election and how it will impact the alliance. No matter the topic, Ukraine or NATO cohesion, it’s the only question asked.”

Steven Everts, a former European diplomat who is now director of the EU Union Institute for Security Studies, has described the prospect of a Trump return as “slightly terrifying.” He adds: “Given the enormous role the United States plays in European security, we now have to think again about what this means for our own politics, for European defense and for Ukraine.”
