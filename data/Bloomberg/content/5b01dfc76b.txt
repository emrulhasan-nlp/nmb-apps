This summer Gallup made headlines with a poll that asked respondents to say whether or not they considered it “safe to live in or visit” each of 16 large American cities. As others have pointed out, the results didn’t exactly square with the murder statistics. Here’s the Gallup ranking, from safest to least safe, alongside the cities’ homicide rates as calculated from the 2022 violent crime statistics released earlier this year by the Major Cities Chiefs Association.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation released its 2022 US crime statistics this week, but amid a painfully long changeover to a new, more-detailed reporting system it still doesn’t have numbers for Miami or New York and those for Dallas and Chicago are so different from the ones previously reported by those cities’ police departments that after wasting half a day trying to incorporate the FBI data here I finally gave up.
