As someone who’s worked in finance for almost 20 years, I’ve never thought of myself as a creator or an artist, but this book made me realize that creativity can take on so many different forms. It's more about the lens we see the world through than it is about being labeled as an artist. The book begins with a concept that bent the way I think about work: Every idea has its own timeline, and when that idea’s time has come, it will be revealed in one way or another. By one creator or another. Starting from that vantage point, you begin to see things differently. This book removes our conventional definitions and gives us permission to color outside the lines we’ve drawn.
