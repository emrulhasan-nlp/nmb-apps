Singapore-listed Vertex Technology Acquisition Corp. has proposed a merger with Taiwanese live streaming platform 17Live Inc., on track to become the city stateâ€™s first blank-check firm to acquire a target.

Vertex will take over 17Live for S$925.1 million ($676 million), the so-called special purpose acquisition company said in a statement Monday. Bloomberg News earlier reported Bloomberg Terminal on the deal, citing people familiar with the matter.
