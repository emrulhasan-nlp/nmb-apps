German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said his government will make sure the current refugee situation doesn’t get out of control and that undocumented migrants will be sent back to their home countries more quickly in the future.

Rejected asylum seekers “will have to leave again,” Scholz said at a town hall meeting in Hamburg on Monday. “We will always work against a loss of control, because that’s not good for a state or a democracy.”
