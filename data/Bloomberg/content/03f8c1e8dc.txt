Ukrainian forces said they shot down Russian Ka-52 attack helicopters Thursday in the Zaporizhzhia and Bakhmut regions, respectively. There was no confirmation from Moscow. Kyiv’s troops continued to push ahead after capturing the small but strategically important village of Urozhaine in the south following an intense week-long battle, the Ukrainian General Staff said on Facebook. They’re seeking to cut off Russia’s land bridge to the Crimea region as a critical element of Ukraine’s counteroffensive.

Germany’s government announced the delivery of two more IRIS-T air defense systems to Ukraine, along with about 4,500 rounds of 155 mm smoke ammunition and ten more ground surveillance radars along with a number of logistical items including semi-trailers.
