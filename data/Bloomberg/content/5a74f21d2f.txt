Switzerland’s anti-immigrant People’s Party is set to consolidate its position as the nation’s strongest political force in an election on Sunday, the most recent example of right-wing gains across central Europe.

The SVP — as the party is known by its German acronym — is set to win more than 28% of the vote, according to the most recent poll, its third-strongest result on record. That would put it almost 10 percentage points ahead of the Social Democrats and match the trend across the region, which has seen the far-right AfD grow in Germany and Giorgia Meloni take power in Italy.
