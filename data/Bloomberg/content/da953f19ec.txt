New York state is considering a plan to hire thousands of migrants and asylum-seekers who have legal work status in the US but may face barriers to finding jobs such as language skills or prior experience.

State agencies have identified about 4,000 positions that could be filled by these individuals, mostly in entry-level roles that are hard to recruit for, according to a proposal by the Department of Civil Service, which was approved earlier this month. The positions are mostly in fields like food service, equipment repairs, facilities management and office assistance.
