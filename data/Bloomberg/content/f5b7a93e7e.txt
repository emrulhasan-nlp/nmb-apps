About 200 people may have been killed by Sudanese militias allied with the Rapid Support Forces, after the group that’s fighting for control of the nation overran an army base in the western Darfur region, humanitarian officials said.

The clashes that took place Nov. 4-6 mark a renewal of fighting between the Arab Rizeigat and African Masalit ethnic groups that has flared for decades in Sudan, especially in the West Darfur state capital, Geneina. In June, more than 500 people were confirmed dead in Darfur in fighting between Sudan’s army and the RSF.
