For the past three decades, South African politics have been defined by the African National Congress. After taking power under Nelson Mandela in the first multiracial elections in 1994, the movement shaped the nation’s new identity, dismantling discriminatory laws, extending basic services across color lines and opening up the mainstream economy to the Black majority.

Today, a party that’s grown accustomed to crushing electoral wins finds its hegemony is fraying. South Africans who long overlooked the ANC leadership’s shortcomings due to its achievements in overthrowing apartheid rule have run out of patience. The country faces rampant poverty and mass unemployment, rolling power blackouts, collapsing road, rail and port infrastructure and endemic crime and corruption. Opinion polls suggest voters may punish the ANC in May 29 elections by denying it a parliamentary majority for the first time, thrusting the country into a new era of coalition politics. If that happens, the party will need to embrace a culture of messy trade-offs and difficult compromises over policies and appointments, with repercussions for citizens, businesses and investors alike.
