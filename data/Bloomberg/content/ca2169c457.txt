Independent Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona said she won’t run for a second term, ending prospects for a turbulent three-way race in one of the nation’s most politically competitive states.

Sinema, who switched her party affiliation from Democrat to independent in 2022, was trailing in third place in polls and her fundraising has been anemic. She criticized partisan dysfunction in Congress in announcing her much-anticipated decision.
