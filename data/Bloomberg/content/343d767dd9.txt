00:11 ♪ >> THE FED HAS LET A TO THAT A LOT OF PLACES DON'T HAVE IF

00:15 THEY CAN BE RESTRICTIVE AND LET THE ECONOMY REALLY CATCH UP.

00:19 >> IF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS ARE EASIER, THERE'S LESS EASING FOR

00:21 THE FED TO DO.

00:22 >> WE WANT TO CUT RATES BUT THE DATA IS NOT LETTING US.

00:31 >> I THINK THEY SHOULD AS A MATTER OF LONG-TERM STRATEGIC

00:35 POLICY MOVE BACK TO NEUTRAL RATES BECAUSE THE ECONOMY

00:36 DOESN'T NEED THEM TO BE TIGHT.

00:40 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE WITH JONATHAN

00:41 FERRO, LISA ABRAMOWICZ, AND ANNMARIE HORDERN. JONATHAN:

00:46 FOUR MONTHS AGO, IT WAS A BIG DEAL AND THIS WILL BE THE DAY

00:48 THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS TO REDUCE INTEREST RATE SO HERE WE

00:51 ARE TRYING TO WORK OUT WHEN THAT WILL HAPPEN.

00:54 LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY THIS MORNING, GOOD MORNING, GOOD

00:57 MORNING, FOR AUDIENCE WORLDWIDE, THIS IS BLOOMBERG

00:59 SURVEILLANCE. THE S&P 500 IS A LITTLE BIT

01:02 SOFTER COMING OFF A TWO DAY WINNING STREAK.

01:04 THE DATA DISRUPTED THE STORYTELLING AT THE END OF LAST

01:08 YEAR. LISA: WHICH IS WHAT I'VE READ FROM

01:11 PRETTY MUCH EVERY ANALYST. IT WILL BE A DIFFICULT FED MEETING.

01:16 DO THEY PUBLICLY QUESTION THEIR ASSUMPTION OF THREE GREAT CUTS

01:19 AT THIS MEETING AND WILL THEY PUBLICLY ALLOW THAT MAYBE RATES

01:22 WON'T FALL AS THEY WANT IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS? JONATHAN:

01:26 WE'VE GOT TO WORK THROUGH A STATEMENT, NEWS CONFERENCE AND

01:30 I WILL GO STRAIGHT TO PROJECTIONS.

01:32 TRYING TO WORK OUT WHETHER THE TWO POLICYMAKERS BECAUSE THAT'S

01:34 ALL IT WILL TAKE TO COME UP AND MAKE THE MEETING TO CUTS AND

01:39 NOT THREE AND THEN IT'S UP TO CHAIRMAN POWELL AND THE NEWS

01:42 CONFERENCE, TO SHAKE THE NARRATIVE. LISA:

01:48 THE TWO DOTS VERSUS THE THREE DOTS, IT'S EXCITING TO TALK

01:49 ABOUT DOTS ALL DAY LONG.

01:55 I'M CURIOUS BEYOND THAT AND BEYOND THIS YEAR.

01:57 IF THEY START TO PULL BACK, HOW FOR RATES CAN GO AND HOW MUCH

02:01 THEY CAN COME DOWN. THAT WILL BE A REVAMP OF WHAT

02:05 WE SAW IN DECEMBER. THAT'S SAYING OUR TO GETTING TO

02:09 NEUTRAL, MAY BE PREMATURE. JONATHAN:

02:12 I'VE ASKED THE SAME QUESTION FOR ABOUT A MONTH.

02:16 CHAIR POWELL LOST CONFIDENCE THAN GAIN CONFIDENCE.

02:21 WOULDN'T YOU SUGGEST HE SHOULD BE LOSING A LITTLE BIT OF

02:22 CONFIDENCE RIGHT NOW? WHETHER HE SHARES THAT PUBLICLY

02:28 IS ANOTHER STORY BUT BASED ON THE INFORMATION, I WOULDN'T BE

02:30 LOOKING AT THAT AND GAINING CONFIDENCE FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN

02:33 SO FAR. LISA: THE MARKET IS NOT GAINING

02:36 CONFIDENCE, IT'S PUSHING RATE -- IT'S PUSHING BACK ON RATE

02:38 CUTS PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY. THEY MIGHT BE SAYING NEUTRAL IS

02:42 3.5%. WE DON'T KNOW IF THE FED WILL

02:47 ADDRESS THIS BUT IT DEPENDS ON FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND HOW

02:49 WORRIED THEY ARE ABOUT A STOCK MARKET THAT IS AT RECORD HIGHS,

02:52 BOND MARKET THAT'S HELD AS BENCHMARK RATE CLIMB.

02:57 THE FINANCIAL CONDITIONS QUESTION MIGHT BE THE MOST

02:59 CRUCIAL ONE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR PSYCHOLOGY AND HOW MUCH THEY

03:01 THINK THE MARKET IS GETTING AWAY FROM WHAT THEY ARE TRYING

03:02 TO DO. JONATHAN: ALL-TIME HIGHS IN THE S&P 500

03:09 GOING INTO A FED DECISION AND WHETHER IT'S AN OBSESSION ABOUT

03:11 THEM REDUCING INTEREST RATES. EQUITY FUTURES ARE NEGATIVE BY

03:12 0.1%. ON THE S&P IN THE BOND MARKET

03:19 AS WELL, THE 10 YEAR TREASURY YIELDS ARE LOWER BY A SINGLE

03:27 BASIS POINT.

03:29 OUT OF THE 4.30'S IN THE LAST HOUR.

03:31 IN THE EFFECTS MARKET, DOLLAR IS ABSENTLY DOMINANT IN G10

03:33 OVER THE LAST WEEK. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, THIS

03:38 YEAR IS NOT STRENGTHENING, IT

03:45 IS WEAKENING, DOLLAR-YEN IS $1.51.

03:46 WE'VE HAD SOME JAPANESE YEN WEAKNESS FOR A FIFTH -- FOR SIX

03:48 TODAY. LISA: WE'RE ABOUT TO TOUCH THE

03:54 WEAKEST LEVEL GOING BACK TO 1990.

03:55 THE EURO IS AT A 16 YEAR LOW. LOOKING AT THESE NUMBERS AND

04:00 TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF THIS WAS WHAT THE BANK OF JAPAN

04:05 WANTED OR DOES THIS FORCE THEIR HAND AGAIN AND SAY IS THIS

04:07 NECESSARY TO HAVE SUCH A DOVISH TONE WHILE MAKING A VERY

04:10 INCREMENTAL RATE HIKE TO ZERO? THIS WILL BE A CHALLENGE FOR

04:14 THEM BECAUSE IT IMPORTS THE WRONG KIND OF INFLATION.

04:18 JONATHAN: COMING UP THIS HOUR, LOTS TO

04:20 DISCUSS.

04:27 THE CHALLENGES FACING MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS IN WASHINGTON

04:31 AND GROWING SIGNS OF WEAKNESS IN THE U.S. LABOR MARKET.

04:36 COUNTING YOU DOWN TO THE FED DECISION AT 2 P.M. EASTERN TIME.

04:41 IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED IT SHOULD ACT BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

04:54 GEORGE IS WITH US AROUND THE TABLE AND IT'S FANTASTIC TO SEE

04:57 YOU. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT YOU

04:59 THINK THEY SHOULD DO AND WHAT THEY WILL DO, WHY DO YOU THINK

05:04 THEY SHOULD BE REDUCING INTEREST RATES RIGHT NOW?

05:07 >> IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT GETTING AHEAD OF WHAT LIES DOWN THE

05:11 ROAD. THEY HAVE A DUAL MANDATE AND

05:14 IT'S BEEN THE MOST CHALLENGING THING FOR THE FED BALANCING

05:16 BETWEEN FULL EMPLOYMENT AND GETTING INFLATION UNDER CONTROL

05:18 WHICH IS BEEN THE PRIMARY FOCUS THE LAST TWO YEARS.

05:21 OUR CONCERN AND GENERALS THE

05:27 LONGER THEY WAIT TO SLOWLY GET US INTO NORMALIZING RATES, THEN

05:30 SEE HOW THE ECONOMY IS HANDLING IT AND WE HAVE A FISCAL POLICY

05:33 BEHIND THIS. IF THEY WAIT TOO LONG, THEY RUN

05:36 THE RISK OF A DECELERATION THAT BECOMES MORE PROTRACTED IN THE

05:37 SECOND HALF. JONATHAN: YOU SAY THEY SHOULD LOOK

05:43 THROUGH STICKY INFLATION, THE HOTTER THAN EXPECTED READS OF

05:46 THE LAST MONTH OR SO, WHY SHOULD THEY DO THAT?

05:50 >> WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE WAGE PRICE SPIRAL AND THAT'S

05:51 BEEN THE CASE ALL ALONG. WE'RE CONCERNED THESE HIGHER

05:54 WAGES OR THE TIGHTNESS IN THE LABOR MARKET WOULD RESULT IN

05:57 HIGHER INFLATION. A LOT OF THIS WAS SUPPLY CHAIN

06:00 DISRUPTIONS, ENERGY AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

06:04 IF YOU ARE WAITING ON THE WAGES SIDE, THERE ARE SIGNS AND LABOR

06:08 MARKET THAT THINGS ARE DECELERATING AND WAGES ARE

06:10 COMING DOWN. YOU RUN THE RISK IF YOU WAIT

06:13 TOO LONG THEN YOU START TO HURT THE JOBS MARKET. LISA:

06:16 THIS IS THE TRICKY PART. WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THE SLOW

06:19 DOWN AND SEEING SIGNS OF WEAKNESS FOR A FULL YEAR NOW IF

06:23 NOT MORE. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR

06:26 THIS AND I'M LOOKING AT THE ATLANTA FED WAGE TRACKER.

06:29 IT'S COMING IN AT ABOUT 5%, WELL ABOVE WHERE THINGS WOULD

06:36 SUGGEST. WHAT GIVES YOU CONVICTION THIS TIME IS

06:39 DIFFERENT AND THAT WEAKNESS IS MORE IMMINENT THAN THREE OR

06:40 FOUR YEARS OUT?

06:46 >> LEADING INDICATORS LIKE OTHER READS WILL LEAD THAT

06:48 INDEX. SIX MONTHS DOWN THE ROAD, THAT

06:51 WAGE INDEX CAN BE 3.5 EASILY. IT'S STILL A HEALTHY NUMBER BUT

06:56 IT'S THE PACE OF DECELERATION THERE.

07:01 IT'S A COMPETITION OF JOBS WE ARE CREATING IN THE PART-TIMERS

07:03 VERSUS FULL-TIME AND IS BEEN INSTALLING OUT OF PROFESSIONAL

07:08 SERVICES PRIMARILY TRAVEL, LEISURE, HOSPITALITY, LOWER

07:12 PAYING TIGHT JOBS AND IF THOSE LOSE PRICING POWER AS WELL,

07:15 THEY ARE THE EASIEST ONES TO GET LAID OFF AND THAT'S THE

07:19 CONCERN. WE ARE HIRING AT A FAST PACE

07:22 BUT IF YOU MISCALCULATE THE LANDING, THOSE JOBS COULD BE

07:24 GONE IN A HEARTBEAT. LISA: PLIES THE BALANCE OF RISK MORE

07:28 IMPORTANT TO FOCUS ON POTENTIAL WEAKNESS IN A LABOR MARKET

07:31 VERSUS PERSISTENT INFLATION THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE GOING

07:36 AWAY?

07:37 >> IT'S A BALANCING ACT, THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT.

07:42 IF YOU DON'T GET IT RIGHT, YOU MISCALCULATE ON WHAT HAPPENS ON

07:43 THE BACK END OF IT, IT WILL COME DOWN TO A JUDGMENT CALL.

07:51 IT'S NOT WHAT THEY SHOULD DO, IT'S WHAT THEY WILL DO THEM

07:53 BECAUSE THEY GOT INFLATION WRONG FOR SO LONG AND THEY WERE

07:58 STUCK WITH TRANSITORY INFLATION AND THAT WAS THE NARRATIVE,

08:00 THEY WILL PROBABLY OVERSTAY THEIR WELCOME THAT WILL CAUSE

08:02 PROBLEMS LATER ON. JONATHAN: WHAT YOU BELIEVE NOW FOR

08:07 LISTENING TO YOU IS AT THE LATER THEY START, THE MORE THEY

08:15 WILL HAVE TO DO DOWN THE ROAD IT'S ULTIMATELY THE EARLIER

08:17 THEY GO, THE MORE LIKELY INFLATION RETURNS.

08:21 WHICH WINS OUT ON THE FOMC AT TODAY'S MEETING AND THE NEXT

08:22 SEVERAL MONTHS?

08:27 >> DOES THE FED GENERATE INFLATION?

08:28 THAT'S A PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTION WE HAVE TO ASK. JONATHAN:

08:30 DO YOU BELIEVE THEY DO?

08:34 >> I THINK THEY BELIEVE THEY CAN INFLUENCE FINANCIAL

08:36 CONDITIONS MAY HAVE A STRONG EFFECT ON INTEREST RATES OF

08:38 COURSE. THE QUESTION IS MORE ABOUT THE

08:40 FCI CHANNEL. HOW QUICK WILL IT TRANSLATE

08:43 INTO INFLATION?

08:50 IF YOU SHIFT TOWARD FCI, IT COULD BE FLEETING.

08:54 MARKETS WERE AT THE HIGHS YESTERDAY BUT WILL THEY BE

08:55 THERE THREE MONTHS DOWN THE ROAD? LISA:

09:02 IF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS IS A TRYING IT -- IS A FINANCIAL

09:04 MECHANISM OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE, SHOULDN'T WORRY THEM

09:07 THAT THERE MECHANISM IS NOW FUNCTIONING TO BRING DOWN

09:12 INFLATION?

09:13 >> IT'S BEEN DELAYED BECAUSE IT STILL LINGERING THIS YEAR,

09:17 FISCAL POLICY IS PROBABLY OFFSET ON THE FEDS TIGHTENING.

09:20 IT'S A PRETTY POWERFUL MOVE. IF YOU TRANSLATE THE ACTUAL

09:23 QUANTUM OF HOW MUCH GOVERNMENT SPENDING WE'VE HAD IN THE

09:28 VARIOUS GOVERNMENT JOBS WHICH HAS KEPT THE JOBS MARKET

09:29 STRONGER THAN WHAT IT SEEMS ON THE PRIVATE SIDE, IF IT WASN'T

09:34 FOR ALL THAT FISCAL THEM FED POLICY WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE.

09:36 LISA: IT SHOCKS ME WHEN WE GET PERSON

09:40 AFTER PERSON SAY THAT FISCAL IS STILL COMING.

09:43 WE GET NEWS OF ANOTHER $20 BILLION GOING TO AN INTEL

09:44 FACTORY. THERE IS SO MUCH MONEY STILL

09:46 GETTING PORTED TO THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR THAT A LOT OF

09:52 PEOPLE COME ON AND SAY THIS IS WHY WE ARE BULLISH.

09:55 WE SEE THE MONEY AND IT'S STILL COMING.

09:56 WE LOOK AT THE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS AND THEY ARE FLUSH WITH CASH

09:58 FOR CONSUMERS MAKING MONEY. HOW DO YOU DISMISS THE FISCAL

10:04 IN BUS -- THE FISCAL IMPULSE OF THAT'S FLEETING?

10:07 >> GETS BIFURCATED WITHIN THE STOCK MARKET.

10:09 YOU HAVE A NARROW SET THAT'S BENEFITING FROM THIS.

10:12 IT'S BIFURCATED ACROSS U.S. HOUSEHOLDS.

10:15 THE TOP 20% IS HOLDING HALF THE ECONOMY UP AND CAN WORK UNTIL

10:23 IT DOESN'T.

10:25 THIS IS SUCH A SENSITIVE POINT AND WE ARE AT THE MERCY OF

10:27 FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND WHAT ARE VALUATIONS?

10:32 HAS A LOT OF THIS BELIEF THE MONEY WILL KEEP COMING IN, WHAT

10:33 IF IT SLOWS DOWN? I'M A BIG BELIEVER IN CHANGE.

10:41 I DOUBT WE BEAT THAT BOGEY FROM LAST YEAR.

10:46 FROM THIS POINT FORWARD, IT BECOMES A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD

10:49 ON FUNDAMENTALS OF FED POLICY VERSUS FISCAL POLICY AND THE

10:52 TRUE STATE OF THE ECONOMY. JONATHAN:

10:54 WE WILL GET SOME FORECASTS BEFORE YOU GO.

10:57 HOW WOULD THE BANK OF JAPAN INFLUENCE YOUR THINKING AT THE

11:01 MOMENT? WHAT'S GOING ON THERE AND WHY

11:05 IS IT SHAKING UP MARKETS IN A BIGGER WAY?

11:09 >> THEY ENDED UP WITH A DOVISH HIKE WITH A LOT OF CONCERN THAT

11:13 THIS WOULD BE THE START OF REPATRIATION OF MONEY BACK TO

11:17 JAPAN, THE LACK OF SPONSORSHIP FOR THE U.S.

11:22 FIXED INCOME MARKET.

11:24 WE TAKE THE OTHER SIDE WHICH THE JAPANESE HAVE BEEN

11:27 DEFENSIVE DURING THE LAST 18 MONTHS BUT IN REALITY, THIS IS

11:30 A NOT -- THIS IS NOT A CONSEQUENTIAL MOVE.

11:35 THE BOJ ALMOST NEEDS THE FED TO EASE NOW OR SOON BECAUSE IT

11:38 WILL DO A LOT OF THE WORK FOR THEM BUT IF NOT, YOU HAVE A

11:43 RISK THAT THE -- THAT THIS NUMBER IS BIG FOR DOLLAR-YEN.

11:46 IF IT KEEPS GOING, THAT'S WHY TREASURIES ARE RALLYING.

11:48 PEOPLE ARE REALIZING THERE WILL BE A NEED FOR FIXED INCOME IN

11:50 JAPAN.

11:56 MY BIAS IS THAT THE MARKET IS TOO SMART FOR ITS OWN GOOD AND

12:00 WE PRICED IN A RATE CUTTING CYCLE MULTIPLE TIMES NOW AND

12:01 THE FED HAS YET TO DELIVER. IT MIGHT END UP BEING VERY

12:05 ANTI-CLIMACTIC VERSUS THE BOJ. THE FED EASES AND IT'S PRICED

12:09 AND IN BONDS DON'T MOVE. JONATHAN:

12:12 IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU, REALLY THOUGHTFUL.

12:14 IT'S BEEN FIVE YEARS SINCE HE SAT AROUND THE TABLE WITH US

12:18 WHICH IS UNBELIEVABLE. LISA: IT'S WONDERFUL TO HAVE HIM.

12:21 I LOVE THE WAY HE THINKS THROUGH THANKS.

12:25 THIS IS THAT THE DATE UNDERPINNING SO MUCH OF THE

12:28 DISAGREEMENT ON WALL STREET NOW. JONATHAN:

12:33 I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT DOLLAR-YEN IS PUSHING $1.52.

12:36 IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU, GEORGE. LET'S GET YOU AN UPDATE ON

12:40 STORIES ELSEWHERE.

12:46 >> INFLATION IN THE U.K. FALLING MORE SHARPLY THAN

12:49 EXPECTED, GOING TO THE LOWEST LEVEL IN 2.5 YEARS.

12:54 CONSUMER PRICE INDEX ROSE 3.4% IN FEBRUARY FROM A YEAR EARLIER.

12:59 THAT IS SLOWER THAN THE 4% THE MONTH BEFORE.

13:00 ECONOMIST SAY THE DATA KEEPS THE BANK OF ENGLAND ON TRACK TO

13:03 REDUCE INTEREST RATES LATER THIS YEAR.

13:07 THE TEXAS MIGRANT ARREST LAW IS BACK ON HOLD.

13:11 JUST HOURS AFTER THE LAW BRIEFLY WENT INTO EFFECT,

13:15 FEDERAL APPEALS COURT STEPPED IN PREVENTING TEXAS FROM

13:17 ARRESTING AND SUPPORTING MIGRANTS ACCUSED OF ENTERING

13:19 THE U.S. ILLEGALLY. THREE-JUDGE PANEL INTERVENED

13:22 AFTER A SERIES OF BACK-AND-FORTH COURT ORDERS

13:24 THAT SAW THE SUPREME COURT WAY IN. THE THREE-JUDGE PANEL HITS

16:18 ED MILLS IS WITH US IN THE STUDIO IN NEW YORK.

16:22 I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT.

16:23 HOW MUCH DISTANCE IS THERE BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES RIGHT

16:28 NOW ON THIS ISSUE?

16:31 >> WHEN WE LOOK BACK AT LENA K AHN, WHEN SHE WAS CONFIRMED BY

16:34 THE SENATE IT WAS OVERWHELMINGLY BIPARTISAN AND

16:35 SHE'S THE HEAD OF THE FTC. THE ONLY THING THAT REPUBLICANS

16:38 DIDN'T LIKE WAS THAT SHE WAS PUT IN CHARGE AS CHAIR.

16:43 WHEN WE LOOK AT DONALD TRUMP, HE RAN AS A POPULIST. WE HAVE

16:48 LARGE ANTITRUST ACTIVITY IN THIS COUNTRY, WE HAVE MAJOR

16:50 TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, MAJOR INCOME INEQUALITY AND WHEN

16:53 THERE IS POPULIST POLITICS, THAT WILL NOT CHANGE WITH THE

16:58 SELECTION. THE FOCUS WILL SHIFT. IT MIGHT BECOME MORE

17:03 TRANSACTIONAL, MORE SPECIFIC TO WHAT MAY BE WHAT DONALD TRUMP

17:06 LIKES OR DISLIKES BUT IT'S NOT ALL CLEAR AFTER THE ELECTION IF

17:11 HE IS ELECTED. JONATHAN: THE LANGUAGE BOTH SIDES USES

17:14 DIFFERENT ULTIMATELY, THE STATE IS GETTING BIGGER NOT SMALLER.

17:16 IS ANYONE ARGUING FOR SMALL GOVERNMENT IN WASHINGTON, D.C.

17:19 ANYMORE?

17:20 >> NO. WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT IS WHEN

17:25 YOU WERE IN CHARGE COME YOU WANT TO PUSH YOUR PRIORITIES.

17:29 WHAT WE SET AN ANTITRUST AS WE'VE HAD A SEISMIC SHIFT AND A

17:32 GLACIAL PACE. WHAT WE ARE SEEING WITH A LOT

17:35 OF THESE DEALS IS THE APPROVAL PROCESS IS PART OF THAT GLACIAL

17:39 PACE BECAUSE GETTING ANYTHING DONE GETTING FOLKS TO THE TABLE

17:43 AND WILLING TO PUT THEIR COMPANIES AT RISK FOR THAT

17:45 PROCESS IS GETTING HARDER AND HARDER. LISA:

17:50 WHAT'S THE NEW FORM OF AMERICAN CAPITALISM AT A TIME WHEN YOU

17:52 GOT ANTITRUST ISSUES GETTING ENFORCED IN DEALS NOT GETTING

17:55 THROUGH AND YOU GET TONS OF MONEY BEING POURED INTO THE NEW

17:59 NATIONAL CHAMPIONS WHETHER IT'S ELECTRIC VEHICLE POLICIES OR

18:04 WHETHER IT'S THESE LOANS AND OTHER GRANTS TO THE LIKES OF

18:07 INTEL BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE CONCERNS AROUND SECURITY?

18:13 >> WE'VE SAID THE NEW CHANGE IN POLICY IS THAT TECHNOLOGY IS A

18:14 NATIONAL SECURITY ASSETS WE SHOULD LOOK AT SOME OF THE

18:16 GOVERNMENT FUNDING FOR TECHNOLOGY SIMILAR TO A DEFENSE

18:19 BUDGET. WE ARE TRYING TO REBUILD OUR

18:21 INDUSTRIAL BASE IN THE UNITED STATES.

18:26 THAT WAS BEHIND THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT AND THAT'S BEHIND

18:28 THE CHIPS AND SCIENCE ACT AND IT WAS BEHIND THE BIPARTISAN

18:29 INFRASTRUCTURE BILL. THE DOLLAR AMOUNT THE

18:33 GOVERNMENT'S ARE WILLING TO PUT INTO DIFFERENT SECTORS AND INTO

18:36 DIFFERENT COMPANIES IS ALL NATIONAL SECURITY DRIVEN, EVEN

18:38 ELECTRIC VEHICLES. WE HAVE FOUGHT WARS FREE

18:44 GENERATION THE MIDDLE EAST FOR ACCESS TO OIL AND A LOT OF

18:45 POLICYMAKERS AND A LOT OF POLICYMAKERS IN D.C.

18:49 ARE SAYING IF WE SHIFT TOWARD AN ELECTRIC ECONOMY, WE NEED TO

18:52 MAKE SURE THAT ELECTRIC COMPONENTS IN THE EEEV

18:53 BATTERIES ARE MADE IN THE UNITED STATES VERSUS A

18:57 POLITICALLY VULNERABLE SPACE. THE FACT THAT TAIWAN HAS THE

19:03 LEADING SEMICONDUCTORS, THAT'S A GEOGRAPHICALLY AND

19:04 GEOPOLITICAL VULNERABLE SPACE. INVESTING IN THAT IS AN

19:09 INVESTMENT IN THE DEFENSE BUDGET AND REBUILDS THE

19:10 INDUSTRIAL BASE OF THE UNITED STATES. LISA:

19:15 SOME SAY THEY EXPECT FISCAL SPENDING TO STOP.

19:19 TRYING TO PICK NATIONAL WINNERS, HOW CAN FISCAL

19:20 SPENDING STOP? DOES IT HAVE TO CONTINUE TO

19:22 SUPPORT THESE INDUSTRIES?

19:26 >> WHEN WE STARTED THIS CONGRESS AFTER REPUBLICANS WON

19:29 A MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, EVERYONE

19:33 THOUGHT WE WOULD GET CUTS.

19:35 WE ARE ON THE VERGE OF FINALLY PASSING AN APPROPRIATION BILL

19:39 FOR THIS YEAR. WE WILL HAVE FLAT FOR DOMESTIC,

19:42 3% UP ON DEFENSE, WE COULD STILL DO A DEFENSE SUPPLEMENTAL.

19:45 WE HAVE ALL OF THOSE BILLS I TALKED ABOUT JUST HITTING THE

19:46 ECONOMY. ON THE CHIPS AND SCIENCE ACT,

19:52 WE GOT AWARDS FOR INTEL WHICH IS NOT EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT.

19:53 THEY WANT MORE. YOU WILL HAVE A PUSH FOR CHIPS

19:58 ACT 2.0. THE SPIGOT IN WASHINGTON TO

20:02 SUPPORTING THE ECONOMY AND SUPPORTING A SOFT LANDING OR NO

20:04 LANDING FROM ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVE. JONATHAN:

20:09 CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW WE GOT HERE AND WHAT THIS IS IN

20:11 RESPONSE TO? SOME MIGHT ARGUE IT WAS IN

20:15 RESPONSE TO CHINA AND MAYBE CHINA 2025 WHICH WAS PRETTY

20:18 BOLD AND MAYBE BRAZEN TO SAY THESE ARE THE INDUSTRIES WE

20:22 WILL DOMINATE. SOME COMMENTATORS HAVE SAID

20:25 THEY MIGHT HAVE TALKED ABOUT MADE IN CHINA IN 2025 OF THE

20:27 CUBAN MEXICAN IN THE PLAN. I'VE LOOKED AT THE SITUATION

20:30 REFLECTED HOW WE USED TO LOOK AT THINGS 10 OR 20 YEARS AGO

20:34 WHEN PEOPLE IN THE WEST SAID ARROGANTLY AND MISTAKENLY

20:38 BELIEVED CHINA WOULD BECOME MORE LIKE US IN THE WEST. IT

20:42 SOUNDS LIKE WE ARE BECOMING MORE LIKE CHINA AND IT'S

20:46 LOOKING MORE AND MORE LIKE CHINA IN THE YEARS TO COME.

20:50 I'M NOT SAYING WASHINGTON, D.C. IS TURNING INTO THE CCP BUT

20:53 SOME MIGHT THINK THAT. I'M NOT SAYING THAT BUT I'M

20:56 SAYING WE'RE GOING DOWN A PATH WE DIDN'T THINK WE BE GOING

20:59 DOWN.

21:00 >> I THINK IT'S MORE EYES WIDE OPEN AS IT RELATES TO CHINA.

21:04 I TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT FOR YEARS, ONE OF THE CONVERSATION

21:06 D.C. WAS YOU HAD TO CHEAT -- TREE 10

21:11 AND A CERTAIN WAY THAT IF YOU CAUSE EMBARRASSMENT AND THEY

21:12 LOST FACE, THAT WAS THE WORST SCENARIO.

21:16 NOW WE HAVE POLICY THAT ESSENTIALLY PUNCHES THEM IN THE

21:18 FACE AND THEY ARE STILL TALKING TO US. THE CONVERSATION IN D.C.

21:23 HAS CHANGED AS WELL AS THE POSTURE.

21:26 THE POSTURE TOWARD CHINA HAS CHANGED.

21:30 WHAT FOLKS IN THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT AND PEOPLE I TALKED

21:34 TO WERE FOCUSED ON WAS CHINA 2027 WAS IS WHEN THEY WANT TO

21:38 HAVE THE MILITARY CAPABILITY OF AN ATTACK ON TAIWAN IF THEY

21:43 WANTED TO. ALL OF THESE TECH RESTRICTIONS

21:45 ARE TRYING TO PUSH BACK THAT TIMELINE, NOT GIVING THEM THE

21:48 SEMICONDUCTORS OR THE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THAT IS

21:50 NECESSARY TO PULL OFF THAT ATTACK IF THEY WANTED TO DO

21:51 THAT. WE DON'T THINK THEY ARE NEAR

21:57 THAT BUT IT IS ALL ABOUT NATIONAL SECURITY.

22:00 WHAT ARE THE AREAS WE STILL CONTROL AS THE UNITED STATES

22:05 GOVERNMENT AND AS EVER TECHNOLOGICAL LEADERSHIP IN THE

22:07 UNIT STATES AND HOW WE CAN SLOW DOWN CHINA AND WHAT THEY WANT

22:09 TO DO? LISA: IS FIGHTING CHINA BECOMING

22:10 CHINA? IS IT ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE ARE

22:13 SEEING WITH THE MORE FOCUS ON NATIONAL CHAMPIONS AND CENTRAL

22:18 PLANNING?

22:19 >> I THINK WE DO IT DIFFERENTLY. WE DON'T HAVE STATE OWNED

22:22 ENTERPRISES. THERE IS STILL A HUGE FOCUS IN

22:26 WASHINGTON, D.C. AND THE DELAY BETWEEN THE

22:27 PASSAGE OF THE CHIPS ACT AND THE PASSAGE OF THE IRA IN

22:31 GETTING THIS MONEY OUT IS MAKING SURE THERE IS SOME LEVEL

22:33 OF SUPPORT FOR WHAT'S BEING DONE.

22:36 THEY ARE PRIORITIZING PROJECTS THAT COULD ACTUALLY HAPPEN.

22:39 BACK IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WHEN THERE WAS

22:43 THE STIMULUS BILL THAT SUBSIDIZED SOLAR AND THERE WAS

22:46 A LOT OF BLOWUPS THERE, THAT HAS CHANGED THE POLICY.

22:49 WE WILL SAVE ITS RIGHT THIS TIME BUT THERE IS AT LEAST A

22:53 FOCUS ON THE PROJECTS THAT ACTUALLY CAN GET DONE AND

22:56 ACTUALLY BE SUCCESSFUL IN HIT PROJECT GOALS BY 2030 IS A KEY

22:59 COMPONENT OF THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT IS DOING.

23:02 THEY GET BLAMED FOR TAKING LONGER BUT HOPEFULLY THEY ARE

23:06 DOING IT RIGHT. JONATHAN: I WONDER WHERE THE MARKET IS

23:09 PUSHING BACK AGAINST THIS STAKE BUT THAT SEEMS TO BE HAPPENING

23:12 IN THE AUTO INDUSTRY. EV'S ARE NOT TAKING OFF AND

23:16 AWAY THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD LIKE.

23:17 WHAT CAN THEY DO ABOUT THAT?

23:19 >> WHAT WE ARE FOCUSED ON WITH THEM IS THE FACT THAT MICHIGAN

23:24 IS ONE OF THE KEY STATES. WHOEVER WINS MICHIGAN PROBABLY

23:25 IS PRESIDENT.

23:32 YOU HAD AN UNPRECEDENTED ACT BY PRESIDENT BIDEN SHOWING UP ON A

23:33 PICKET LINE FOR THE AUTOWORKERS. I THINK THE NEXT THING WE WILL

23:39 SEE IS AN AGGRESSIVE FIGHT AGAINST CHINESE MADE CARS AND

23:41 WHERE THEY ARE GOING IN THE WORLD.

23:44 THAT'S THE NEXT TRADE FIGHT THAT'S COMING HERE.

23:48 WE WILL SEE A FOCUS NOT ON EV'S NECESSARILY FROM CHINA BUT

23:52 THERE IS A LOT OF EXCESS CAPACITY IN CHINA ON INTERNAL

23:55 COMBUSTION ENGINES. ARE THEY GOING TO FLOOD THE

23:58 MARKET? WILL THAT BE A CHALLENGE TO

24:00 DETROIT? THAT'S WHAT YOU WILL SEE IN D.C.

24:04 AS A HUGE FIGHT FOR THE INDUSTRY. JONATHAN:

24:08 THAT FIGHT PICKED UP BIG TIME OVER THE WEEKEND WITH THREATS

24:14 OF 100% TARIFFS ON CHINESE VEHICLES MADE IN MEXICO.

24:16 THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH US.

24:20 COMING UP, A STRONGER DOLLAR AND A MUCH WEAKER JAPANESE YEN.

24:25 THAT'S NEXT, THIS IS BLOOMBERG. ♪

24:45 JONATHAN: BUT TODAY WINNING STREAK ON THE

24:47 S&P 500 WITH FUTURES A LITTLE BIT SOFTER.

24:51 IT'S COMING OFF THE BACK OF ALL TIME HIGHS AT THE CLOSE GOING

24:53 INTO THE FEDERAL RESERVE DECISION THIS AFTERNOON.

24:56 NASDAQ FUTURES ARE GOING ABSENTLY NOWHERE.

25:00 IN THE BOND MARKET, YIELDS ARE DROPPING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN

25:03 ABOUT A WEEK ON THE TWO YEAR AND THE 10 YEAR.

25:06 DOWN ONE BASIS THIS MORNING. STILL PRETTY CLOSE TO THE HIGHS

25:11 OF THE YEAR ON THE TWO YEAR YIELD AND DOWN ABOUT ONE BASIS

25:17 POINT. LISA: WHERE IS THE SYMMETRY OF RISK

25:20 TODAY AT THE PRESS -- AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE WITH THE

25:22 FEDERAL RESERVE. IS IT IT PILING IN HIS PEOPLE

25:28 REALIZE THIS FED DOES WANT TO HIKE.

25:32 BANK OF AMERICA YESTERDAY SAID IT WELL AND SAID IF THEY MOVE

25:38 FROM THREE DOTS TO TWO DOTS, YOU WILL SEE A SELL OFF WITH 10

25:41 YEAR YIELDS RISING. JONATHAN: WHAT IS THE EQUITY MARKET

25:45 TELLING THE BOND MARKET? WHAT ARE STOCKS TELLING BONDS?

25:49 LISA: THAT THEY PROBABLY NEED TO BE

25:51 PRICING IN A HOTTER ECONOMY. THIS IS WHERE THE COLLECTIVE

25:56 WEB -- WISDOM OF CROWDS IS TELLING THE FED THAT YOUR JOB

25:58 IS NOT DONE AND WE ARE CONCERNED THAT MAYBE INFLATION

26:00 COULD BE RUNNING FOR HOTTER AND LONGER.

26:06 I WONDER IF THE BALANCE OF RISK FOR THEM REALLY IS TO PRESERVE

26:09 SOME SORT OF SENSE THERE WILL BE THREE RATE CUTS AND WE

26:11 PRIORITIZE LABOR MARKET AHEAD OF THE POTENTIAL RESURGENCE IN

26:13 INFLATION. JONATHAN: LET'S GET TO THE WISDOM OF

26:15 FOREIGN EXCHANGE. THE DOLLAR IS ABSENTLY

26:20 DOMINANT, FIVE DAYS OF DOLLAR STRENGTH, THE LONGEST STREAK

26:22 SINCE SEPTEMBER.

26:28 DOLLAR-YEN, ONE DOLLAR 51.72, GETTING CLOSER TO $1.52. LISA:

26:33 THAT'S THE WEAKEST LEVELS GOING BACK TO 1990.

26:36 IS THIS WHAT THE BANK OF JAPAN WANTED?

26:41 AT WHAT POINT WILL THEY RETHINK THE DOVISH APPROACH TO

26:43 OTHERWISE SUPERFICIAL RATE HIKES. THEY HAVE TO BE GETTING A

26:47 LITTLE BIT CONCERNED. JONATHAN: WE WILL TALK ABOUT SOME OF THIS

26:51 IN A MOMENT.

26:57 THE TOP STORY TODAY IS THE FED RATE DECISION AT 2 P.M.

26:59 EASTERN WITH FED CHAIR JAY POWELL SET TO SPEAK AT 2:30 P.M.

27:02 AND RATES ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN ON HOLD THE FOMC WILL

27:05 RELEASE A NEW DOT PLOT AND PROJECTIONS.

27:08 STILL EXPECTING THREE CUTS THIS YEAR WITH A DOVISH CHAIR POWELL

27:11 DESPITE A STRING OF HOTTER THAN EXPECTED INFLATION PRINTS SINCE

27:13 THE LAST MEETING. IF YOU BEEN MISSING THE

27:18 COVERAGE OVER THE LAST WEEK ON THE DOT PLOT, IT WILL ON THE --

27:22 IT WILL ONLY TAKE TWO OFFICIALS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO COME

27:24 UP AND THAT WILL CHANGE THE MEDIAN. FROM THREE TO 2.

27:27 IS THAT A BIG DEAL GIVEN THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL OVER THE

27:30 LAST FEW MONTHS? LISA: WE ARE TALKING ABOUT EIGHT OF

27:33 19 FED OFFICIALS. THIS IS HOW CLOSELY PEOPLE ARE

27:36 SCRUTINIZING THIS. THEY HAVE TWO RATE CUTS PRICED

27:40 IN RATHER THAN THREE. IF TWO MORE JOIN THAT, THEN YOU

27:42 HAVE A BASELINE. I'M INTERESTED IN THE LONGER

27:46 RUN AND HOW THEY TELEGRAPHED A LONGER-TERM INFLATION

27:50 EXPECTATION OF LONGER-TERM RATE EXPECTATIONS FOR NEXT YEAR IN

27:51 THE YEAR AFTER.

27:53 DO THEY EXPECT NEUTRAL NOT GETTING HIGHER BUT

27:57 NOT BEING ABLE TO CUT IS MUCH LONGER-TERM? JONATHAN:

28:02 DO YOU THINK THEY WILL ENTERTAIN THAT TODAY AT THE

28:06 NEWS CONFERENCE? LISA: NOTHING NEUTRAL RATE BUT THEY

28:09 HAVE THE STATEMENT OF ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS AND THEY HAVE TO

28:11 REASSESS WHETHER THE DOWNGRADE TO THE RATE FORECAST BACK IN

28:15 DECEMBER REALLY WAS APPROPRIATE FOR IT WAS PREMATURE. JONATHAN:

28:21 IT MAY BE TOO SOON TO TALK ABOUT REDUCING INTEREST RATES?

28:23 LISA: THE MARKET IS SAYING THAT BUT

28:26 ALSO THAT THEY CANNOT CUT AS MUCH BECAUSE THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR

28:28 COMPS DON'T MAKE IT AS EASY FOR THEM FOR THE BEGINNING OF NEXT

28:31 YEAR. JONATHAN: INFLATION A LITTLE BIT HOTTER

28:33 LET'S TURN TO LUXURY NAMES IN EUROPE PLUNGING.

28:38 GUCCI SALES HAVE DROPPED 20% IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION DURING

28:39 THE FIRST QUARTER. THE LUXURY GROUP IS ATTENDING

28:42 TO VITAL -- REVITALIZE THE GUCCI BRAND.

28:45 THE DROP IS SET TO WIPE AT A PROXIMALLY 7.6 BILLION MARKET

28:52 VALUE. THE SLUMP IS WEIGHING ON COMPETITORS.

28:55 LUXURY SALES IN CHINA HAVE COOLED OVER THE PAST YEAR.

28:59 GUCCI HAS ITS OWN PROBLEMS BUT WHEN A COMPANY COMES OUT AND

29:04 SAYS SALES ARE DOWN 20% IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION, THAT'S

29:06 WHERE THE LIKES OF THE COMPETITION IS SPOOKED.

29:08 GUCCI IS MORE HINGED TO THE CONSUMER.

29:11 I WAS LOOKING AT THIS LAST NIGHT AND WONDERING HOW

29:16 ISOLATED ARE THEY AND HOW MUCH IS THIS A GUCCI PROBLEM AND HOW

29:18 MUCH IS THIS IS A CHINESE CONSUMER PROBLEM?

29:21 HOW MUCH IS THIS THE NATIONALIST BENT AND PEOPLE

29:24 STAYING CLOSE TO HOME AND BUYING STUFF THERE VERSUS NOT

29:27 HAVING THE MEANS TO GO OUT AND SPEND? I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER.

29:33 GUCCI HAS STILL 12 PROJECTS -- PRODUCTS. JONATHAN:

29:37 THEY'RE TRYING TO MOVE FROM LOWNDES LUXURY TO QUIET LUXURY,

29:38 GOOD LUCK. LISA: IT'S KNOWN FOR LUXURY. JONATHAN:

29:44 BIG BELT BUCKLES. LISA: IF PEOPLE DON'T WANT THAT, WILL

29:49 THEY MIGRATE TO WHAT SOMEONE ELSE MIGHT WEAR?

29:56 JONATHAN: GUCCI'S GOT PROBLEMS. TK IS THE

30:01 LUXURY EXPERT AND HE WILL TELL YOU THAT GUCCI HAS HAD PROBLEMS

30:08 FOR A WHILE. LISA:

30:10 GUCCI IS DEFINITELY THE REALM OF TOM KEENE RATHER THAN LISA

30:16 ABRAMOWICZ.

30:17 JONATHAN: I WILL SHARE MORE LATER.

30:20 THE FAA WRAPPING UP PRESSURE ON BOEING IN AN INTERVIEW WITH NBC

30:27 NEWS. THE FAA ADMINISTRATOR SAID THE

30:30 JET MAKER HAS NO OTHER OPTION, THEY NEED TO MAKE SAFE

30:33 AIRPLANES WHERE THEY WILL BE CAPPED AT A PRODUCTION LEVEL

30:35 THAT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE.

30:42 LAST MONTH, BOEING WAS GIVEN 19 DAYS TO DEVELOP A PLAN TO

30:43 IMPROVE ITS CULTURE AND PRACTICES AFTER A SERIES OF

30:45 MISHAPS INCLUDING A PANEL FLYING OFF A 737 MAX JET

30:47 MIDFLIGHT. BOEING IS FOCUSED ON TAKING

30:53 ACTION WITH TRANSPARENCY AT EVERY TURN.

30:56 THE MORE TRANSPARENCE WE GET, THE WORSE IT LOOKS. LISA:

31:00 THERE ARE NO PROPOSED SOLUTIONS. IT SEEMS THEY PRIORITIZED

31:03 PRODUCTION AFTER SAFETY AND YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT.

31:05 THAT'S NOT HELPFUL TO THE CAUSE. WHEN DO WE FIND OUT WHAT THAT

31:09 ACTUALLY MEANS IN TERMS OF THE STEPS THEY CAN TAKE TO CHANGE

31:11 SOMETHING? JONATHAN: GOING DOWN AGAIN IN THE

31:14 PREMARKET THIS MORNING. U.S. DOLLAR IS GAINING AHEAD OF

31:19 TODAY'S FED DECISION AND A HIKE FROM THE BANK OF JAPAN

31:20 YESTERDAY.

31:36 IN THE FX MARKET WITH THE JAPANESE YEN, DOLLAR-YEN

31:40 BREAKING TOWARDS ONE DOLLAR $.52 EVEN WITH THE FIRST

31:41 INTEREST RATE HIKE AND 17 YEARS. WE ARE GOING TO GO BACK TO 2007.

31:47 WHAT DO YOU THINK IS DEVELOPING IN JAPAN?

31:49 >> THANKS FOR HAVING ME. IT'S BEEN A WHILE IT'S ALWAYS A

31:51 PLEASURE TO BE ON THE SHOW.

31:58 THE BANK OF JAPAN REALLY HELD OFF THIS LIFT UP BECAUSE THE

32:00 TWO TIMES THEY TRIED TO HIKE THEY WENT BACK INTO RECESSION.

32:05 I CAN'T BLAME THEM FOR BEING CAUTIOUS.

32:08 AT THIS POINT, IT SEEMS TO HAVE ENGINEERED A SUCCESSFUL EXIT.

32:14 BY SUCCESSFUL, I MEAN INFLATION IS AROUND 2% GIVE OR TAKE.

32:16 MORE IMPORTANTLY, THEY BEEN ABLE TO AVOID DISRUPTIVE MOVES

32:19 IN THE MARKET. DISRUPTIVE WOULD BE A MUCH

32:25 STRONGER YEN AND SHARPLY HIGHER GDP YIELDS.

32:30 WITH ALL THE LEAKS, I TO MY HAD TO THEM.

32:35 THEY'VE AVOIDED FOR NOW A SORT OF DISRUPTIVE UNWISE MOVES.

32:39 IF THEY HAD TO TAKE A WEAKER YEN OVER A STRONGER YEN, THEY

32:44 WOULD PROBABLY TAKE A WEAKER ONE. THEY CAN INTERVENE AND HELP

32:50 MAINTAIN STABLE EFFECTS MARKETS AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK IS

32:52 BEING SEEN NOW AND WILL BE SEEN FOR THE TIME BEING. JONATHAN:

32:59 WHAT IS STABLE ABOUT THE JAPANESE AT THE MOMENT?

33:01 WHY WOULDN'T THIS CONCERNED THEM?

33:07 >> WE'VE BEEN AROUND $1.50 FOR THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS AND WE

33:12 HAVEN'T HAD HUGE MOVES SINCE THE END OF 2022 WHEN THE BANK

33:15 OF JAPAN LAST INTERVENED.

33:23 IT'S STARTS CREEPING UP TOWARD $1.55, THE JOB SITUATION COMES

33:26 FIRST BUT UP I WOULD NOT LOOK AT INTERVENTION.

33:28 THEY ARE WILLING AND ABLE TO UNDERTAKE THIS.

33:32 RIGHT NOW, THE MARKET IS PRICING IN A VERY DOVISH BANK

33:33 OF JAPAN. THAT'S THE GUIDANCE THEY

33:35 PROVIDED. THEY SHOULD REMAIN ACCOMMODATIVE FOR QUITE SOME

33:40 TIME. THE SWAPS MARKET IS PRICING AND

33:45 50 BASIS POINTS OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS WHICH SEEMS TO BE LOW

33:48 BUT THAT'S WHAT THE MARKET IS GOING WITH.

33:52 THE BANK OF JAPAN CAN CHANGE ITS GUIDANCE AND PUTS THEM AIR

33:54 ON THE M. THEY'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THE

33:57 WEEK YEN REALLY FOR QUITE A WHILE NOW.

34:04 YES, THE YELLOW LIGHTS ARE BLINKING BUT IT'S NOT REALLY

34:05 ALARMING AT THIS POINT. LISA: THERE IS THE ISSUE ABOUT THE

34:09 FEDERAL RESERVE AND THE MEETING TODAY AND HOW MUCH A HAWKISH

34:11 TONE COULD TURBOCHARGE THE SELLOFF IN THE YEN.

34:16 HOW HIGH IS THE BAR FOR THAT TYPE OF MORE PROTRACTED MOVE?

34:23 >> I THINK PART OF IT WAS LUCK THAT THEY AVOIDED THIS.

34:26 THE LIFT OFF CAME AT A TIME WHEN THE DOLLAR WAS STRONG.

34:29 WE DIDN'T SEE A HUGE JUMP IN THE YEN.

34:32 MAYBE PEOPLE WERE LOOKING AT $1.35 BUT WE ARE NOT SEEING

34:35 THAT. IT'S NOT A YEN STORY AT THIS

34:38 POINT. IT'S REALLY A DOLLAR STORY.

34:43 THE U.S. ECONOMY REMAINS HEAD AND

34:44 SHOULDERS ABOVE EVERYONE ELSE. THE DOLLAR REMAINS SUPPORTED BY

34:47 HIGH INTEREST RATES. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT FED

34:51 EXPECTATIONS. I THINK IT'S HIGHER FOR LONGER.

34:57 I THINK WE COULD GET A HAWKISH SHIFT IN THE DOT PLOTS WHETHER

35:03 IT'S IN 2024 AND YEAR. THE FED OFFICIALS ARE PRICING

35:12 IN 170 BASIS POINTS OF CUTS THROUGH 2025 AND GIVEN HOW

35:14 STRONG THE U.S. ECONOMY IS, THAT SEEMS OVERDONE.

35:18 MOST OF THE MARKET HAS BOUGHT INTO THE SOFT LANDING STORY.

35:21 175 SEEMS VERY AGGRESSIVE. I THINK THERE IS ROOM FOR THIS

35:24 HAWKISH SURPRISE. THE ONLY WARNING I HAVE IS I

35:31 NEVER UNDERSTOOD CHAIR POWELL'S PENSIVE DEBT PROPENSITY TO

35:33 SURPRISE THE MARKET WITH HIS DOVISH REMARKS DURING THE PRESS

35:34 CONFERENCE. I ALWAYS HEDGE MY BETS. LISA:

35:40 WHICH OF THE RISEN WHY MAYBE -- WHICH IS THE REASON WHY PEOPLE

35:41 HAVE BEEN MORE BEARISH ON THE DOLLAR.

35:45 THE POSITIONING HAS BEEN SUCH THAT PEOPLE ARE PREPARED FOR A

35:49 GREENBACK THAT IS WEAKENING, NOT STRENGTHENING.

35:53 HOW OFF-SITE DO SOME OF THOSE TRADES BE IF WE GET A HAWKISH

35:58 TILT THAT MAINTAINS THROUGH THE PRESS CONFERENCE WITH JAY

36:02 POWELL?

36:03 >> BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF 2023 AND 2024, CONSENSUS CALLS

36:07 WERE FOR A WEAKER DOLLAR WHETHER IT'S BECAUSE OF A U.S.

36:08 RECESSION WHICH IS NOT HAPPENING OR SOFT LANDING.

36:12 IT WAS PREDICATED UPON A DOVISH FED. WE JUST HAVEN'T SEEN IT.

36:16 I THINK THE MARKET WAS PRICING AND 150 BASIS POINTS OF CUTS AT

36:19 THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR STARTING IN MARCH.

36:22 HERE WE ARE TWO MONTH LATER IN THAT CALL HAS BEEN WRONG.

36:28 THE REPRICING STILL HAS ROOM TO GO. I'M ONE OF THE LATECOMERS TO

36:30 SOFT LANDING. I'VE ALWAYS BEEN SKEPTICAL BUT

36:34 I THINK IT'S HAPPENING. IT'S HAPPENED ONCE OR TWICE IN

36:37 MY CAREER. IT'S LIKE A UNICORN, IT'S RARE

36:41 BUT I THINK WE'VE SEEN IT UNFOLD.

36:47 IF THIS PROVES TO BE THE CASE, 175 BASIS POINTS RATE CUTS BY

36:50 END OF NEXT YEAR JUST SEEMS TOO MUCH.

36:55 TODAY WILL BE VERY KEEP BUT IT DEPENDS ON THE DOLLAR -- ON THE

36:56 DATA. THE DATA REMAIN FIRM.

37:02 THE MARKET REMAINS STRONG, WE ARE SEEING SOME SIGNS OF

37:04 SOFTENING BUT NOT ENOUGH TO GET US CONCERNED.

37:07 FOR NOW, IT'S STEADY AS SHE GOES. I THINK EUROPE HAS ITS

37:15 PROBLEMS, JAPAN IS ONE OF THE

37:21 REASONS THEY'VE BEEN CAUTIOUS IS THAT THE JAPANESE ECONOMY

37:22 HIT A SOFT PATCH. AWFUL STUFF COMING OUT OF CHINA

37:26 SO THE U.S. IS THE DRIVER OF GLOBAL GROWTH

37:30 NOW AND THAT'S WHY THE DOLLAR REMAINS ATTRACTIVE. JONATHAN:

37:33 GREAT TO CATCH UP WITH YOU. THE DOLLAR STRONGER FOR A FIFTH

37:36 CONSECUTIVE SESSION.

37:42 TO TAKE A STEP BACK, WE DID THE SAME THING ABOUT 40 MINUTES AGO

37:45 -- THIS MARCH MEETING IS A VERY DIFFERENT MARCH MEETING TO THE

37:48 ONE PEOPLE EXPECTED ABOUT THREE MONTHS AGO. LISA:

37:52 THIS WILL BE ONE THAT HAS TO ADDRESS DATA THAT HAS NOT

37:55 COOPERATED AND HAS NOT GIVEN THEM MORE COMFORT IN A MARKET

37:57 THAT'S MOVED AWAY FROM THE FED EVEN THOUGH IT'S ADAPTING TO

37:59 WHAT THE FED PROJECTED BACK IN DECEMBER.

38:02 IT'S ACCELERATING PAST THAT. IT'S SUGGESTING THAT MAYBE THE

38:05 PARADIGM HAS SHIFTED. JONATHAN: 2:00 P.M., THE FED DECISION

38:09 THIS AFTERNOON. HERE IS YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF.

38:17 >> THE ECB IS LIKELY TO CUT RATES IN JUNE ACCORDING TO

38:18 PRESIDENT CHRISTINE LAGARDE. BEYOND THAT, SHE SAID THEY ARE

38:22 NOT ABLE TO COMMIT TO A FUTURE PATH. SPEAKING IN FRANKFURT THIS

38:26 MORNING, SHE SAID OUR DECISIONS WILL HAVE TO REMAIN DATA

38:30 DEPENDENT AND MEETING BY MEETING , RESPONDING TO NEW

38:31 INFORMATION AS IT COMES IN. SAMSUNG SHARES POSTED THEIR

38:36 BIGGEST GAIN IN MORE THAN SIX MONTHS AFTER A BACKING BY

38:42 NVIDIA. THE CEO REPORTEDLY SAID HE

38:44 PLANS TO USE SAMSUNG AS A SUPPLIER OF HIGH BEEN WITH

38:47 MEMORY CHIPS. NVIDIA UNVEILED ITS NEXT

38:49 GENERATION OF AI HARDWARE CALLED BLACKWELL IN A

38:53 CONFERENCE IN CALIFORNIA EARLIER THIS WEEK.

38:58 INTEL IS IN LINE TO RECEIVE NEARLY $20 BILLION IN GRANTS

38:59 AND LOANS FROM THE U.S. TO BUILD SEMICONDUCTOR PLANTS.

39:04 THIS MARKS THE LARGEST AWARD YET EVER BY THE WHITE HOUSE TO

39:07 BRING CHIPS MANUFACTURING BACK TO AMERICA.

39:10 THE WORD COMES AMID AN AMBITIOUS TURNAROUND PLAN FOR

39:12 THE COMPANY UNDER THEIR CEO. THAT'S YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF.

39:16 JONATHAN: THANK YOU. INTEL UP BY A LITTLE MORE THAN

39:20 3% THIS MORNING. UP NEXT, DECISION DAY FOR THE

39:23 FED -- >> GRATES AT SOME BOY SHOULD -- AT SOME POINT SHOULD

39:27 MOVE LOWER. LACK OF COMPETENT IS WHEN DOES

39:30 THE WINDOW OPEN?

39:33 >> IF YOU CAN'T JUSTIFY A CUT BY JUNE, YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE A

39:36 LEG TO STAND ON TO CUT UNTIL EARLY NEXT YEAR. JONATHAN:

39:40 THAT CONVERSATION IS NEXT. FROM NEW YORK CITY, THIS IS

39:41 BLOOMBERG. ♪

40:00 JONATHAN: LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY,

40:02 WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM. THE S&P 500 IS SLIGHTLY SOFTER,

40:07 NOT EVEN LOWER BY 0.1%. BACKING AWAY A LITTLE BIT FROM

40:10 THE HIGHS OF THE YEAR. DECISION DAY FOR THE FED TODAY.

40:18 >> RATES AT SOME POINT SHOULD MOVE LOWER.

40:21 THE LACK OF CONFIDENCE IS ABOUT WHEN DOES THE WINDOW OPEN, WHEN

40:25 DOES THE DATA TELL THEM IT'S OK TO START?

40:29 THERE'S A LITTLE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHEN TO START BUT I THINK

40:32 THE CONFIDENCE OF THE OVERALL DISINFLATION TREND IS THERE.

40:36 >> IF YOU CAN'T JUSTIFY A CUT BY JUNE, YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE A

40:40 LEG TO STAND ON TO START CUTTING UNTIL EARLY NEXT YEAR.

40:44 THAT MIGHT BE A REASON TO GET GOING NOW UNLESS YOU ARE REALLY

40:46 COMFORTABLE STARTING NEXT MONTH. JONATHAN:

40:49 THE FED RATE DECISION IS COMING AT 2 P.M. EASTERN TIME.

40:54 WE EXPECT THE FED TO HOLD GREAT STEADY BUT PREDICTING 75 BASIS

40:55 POINTS RATE CUTS THIS YEAR.

41:02 FRANCES DONALD WRITES THIS --

41:15 FRANCIS IS WITH US AROUND THE TABLE, GOOD MORNING.

41:16 >> GOOD MORNING. JONATHAN: THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR, YOU

41:23 SAID PICK YOUR POISON, EITHER THE DATA IS BETTER AND WE HAVE

41:26 RATE CUTS OR IT GETS WORSE AND WE HAVE TO LOOK AT A SOFT

41:28 LANDING.

41:30 >> WHEN WE WROTE THAT KHMER VIEW WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS

41:33 WILL HAPPEN WHICH IS THE DATA WILL NOT SOFT AND AND THE

41:37 INFLATION WILL NOT COME DOWN ENOUGH, WE WILL HAVE TO PRICE

41:39 OF WHAT WAS AT THE TIME ALMOST SIX RATE CUTS GOING DOWN TO

41:44 AROUND 3 AND LATER THIS YEAR IS THE SECOND PART WHICH WE STILL

41:47 BELIEVE THE DATA WILL DETERIORATE IN SUCH A WAY WHERE

41:53 WE END UP WITH LATER RATE CUTS BUT FASTER AS THE SOFT LANDING

41:55 NARRATIVE STARTS TO DISPERSE. WE STILL HAVE A FEW MORE MONTHS

41:57 AHEAD OF THAT. TWO THINGS CAN BE TRUE THE SAME

42:00 TIME. WE CAN BELIEVE RECESSION RISK

42:02 IS CURRENTLY HIGHER THAN PRICE BUT NOT QUITE TIME TO TRADE

42:06 THAT STORY YET. JONATHAN: WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR WITH

42:09 THE FED THE MOST?

42:13 >> I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT THE

42:15 DECISION-MAKING FUNCTION AT THE FEDERAL RESERVE'S RIGHT NOW.

42:19 WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR TODAY IS GIVE ME YOUR NUMBERS, TELL ME

42:20 THE DATA YOU'RE LOOKING AT. ARE YOU LOOKING AT SUPER CORE

42:25 INFLATION WHICH IS WAY TOO HOT OR ARE YOU PLAYING WITH THE

42:27 NUMBERS BECAUSE WE CAN ALL DO THAT?

42:30 CAN YOU DO CPI, X SHELTER AND GET DOWN TO 1.8%?

42:35 THERE IS ALL MANNER OF DATA TO ARGUE IN ANY DIRECTION RIGHT

42:39 NOW. I CAN MAKE A CASE FOR THE DOVES

42:42 OR THE HAWKS BUT I WANT TO KNOW WHAT CASE IS JAY POWELL GOING

42:47 TO BUILD? LISA:

42:49 PEOPLE ARE EXPECTING THAT DOVISH PICKUP THAT HAPPENS IN

42:54 THE PRESS CONFERENCE.

42:56 WHAT ABOUT THE ASYMMETRY OF RISK AND WHY SOME PEOPLE THINK

43:00 IT'S IMPORTANT TO CUT RATES NOW BECAUSE THE DOWNSIDE IS

43:02 NONLINEAR AND COULD HAPPEN QUICKLY.

43:04 WHAT'S YOUR VIEW ON THAT?

43:07 >> WE ARE GOING THROUGH FORECAST REVIEW IS MOST

43:11 ECONOMIST TO EVERY FEW MONTHS AND WE SEE THE DATA FLOATING

43:13 AROUND 0%. SLIGHTLY BELOW AND SLIGHTLY

43:16 ABOVE DEPENDING HOW THE CONSUMER MOVES.

43:20 THE TWO THINGS THAT KEEP ME UP AT NIGHT IS THAT THE AVERAGE

43:23 TIME FROM THE FIRST RATE HIKE TO THE FULL IMPACT ON THE

43:24 ECONOMY IS TWO YEARS. THAT'S TODAY.

43:29 THE WINDOW FOR THESE CHALLENGES FOR RECESSION CALLS TO CLOSE IS

43:33 NOT BEHIND US, IT'S AHEAD OF US. THE SECOND THING IS THIS

43:38 NON-LINEARITY. WHEN THINGS BREAK IN THE

43:40 ECONOMY , THEY DON'T BREAK SLOWLY AND THEY DON'T BREAK IN

43:44 STRAIGHT LINES. SOME OF THE WEAKNESS WE ARE

43:46 SEEING IN THE JOB MARKET IS WORTH KEEPING OUR EYE ON.

43:49 REHIRING ACTIVITY IS ON QUITE A BIT.

43:53 THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF SURVEY DATA SAYING WE ARE NOT

43:56 AS EXCITED ABOUT JOBS AND THERE IS STILL 2 MILLION JOB OPENINGS

43:58 RELATIVE TO THE AMOUNT OF WORKERS LOOKING FOR JOBS.

44:01 WHEN I START TO SEE A LITTLE BIT OF SOFTNESS AND LABOR,

44:06 THERE IS A THOUGHT THAT WHEN THIS BREAKS, IT WON'T BE SLOW

44:11 AND STEADY. LISA: IS THIS TIME DIFFERENT?

44:14 THEY ARE PUMPING UP AGAINST SOME OF THE RESTRICTION THE FED

44:16 IS TRYING TO PUT IN THE MARKET.

44:19 >> FISCAL IS A HUGE PART OF THE STORY AND HAS COMPLICATED THE

44:21 LAST FEW YEARS, NO QUESTION. PROCYCLICAL FISCAL SPENDING IS

44:25 NOT PART OF THE ECONOMIST HANDBOOK.

44:28 WE DID NOT LEARN THAT IN HER TEXT BOOKS WHEN WE WENT TO

44:33 SCHOOL AND LABOR SHORTAGES AND THE NEW SUPPLY-SIDE DRIVEN

44:34 WORLD WHICH MAKES INFLATION AND GROWTH LESS INTEREST RATE

44:35 SENSITIVE. THESE ARE THINGS THAT ARE

44:39 DIFFERENT BUT MAYBE I AM OLD-FASHIONED.

44:43 I CANNOT GET AWAY FROM THE IDEA THAT WHEN MONEY COSTS MORE, YOU

44:44 BORROW LESS. WHEN YOU LOSE YOUR JOB, YOU

44:47 DON'T SPEND AS MUCH MONEY. THESE ARE TRUISMS THAT I THINK

44:52 WILL STILL PERSIST. THEREFORE WE END UP IN A SITUATION WHERE

44:55 I HAVE MOLLIFIED OR REDUCE THE IMPACT OF RATE HIKES IN MY

44:59 FORECAST BUT I CANNOT ESCAPE THE IDEA THAT THERE ARE SOME

45:00 THINGS THAT WILL ALWAYS BE TRUE. HIGHER RATES SLOW ECONOMIES.

45:05 JONATHAN: YOU WEAR TWO HATS. MARKETS ARE AT ALL-TIME HIGHS,

45:10 DOES THAT INFLUENCE ANY OF THE THINKING AT THE FEDERAL RESERVE?

45:14 >> BACK IN THE FALL, CHAIR POWELL WAS ALL ABOUT FINANCIAL

45:18 CONDITIONS AND THEN WHEN HE PIVOTED IN DECEMBER, THAT

45:19 DIDN'T SEEM TO MATTER AS MUCH ANYMORE.

45:23 I'M LOOKING FOR TWO THINGS TODAY, WILL HE TALK ABOUT

45:24 FINANCIAL CONDITIONS? HOW DOES HE SEE THAT AND I WANT

45:30 TO KNOW WHAT THEIR 2025 AND 2026 OUTLOOK LOOKS LIKE.

45:33 THERE IS SO MUCH FOCUS ON TWO OR THREE HIKES THIS YEAR.

45:38 FOR MOST OF OUR FUNDS, TWO OR THREE THROUGH SEPTEMBER WILL

45:43 NOT MAKE A DIFFERENCE. WHAT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE IS

45:47 IS THIS A 1995 EASING SINGLE -- CYCLE OR GOING FOR TWO OR 300

45:50 BASIS POINTS AND IT WILL BE MORE IMPORTANT IN 2025 AND 2026

45:54 THAN SOME OF THE MINUTIA AROUND WHEN THEY START. JONATHAN:

46:00 ONE ANALYST SAID HOW THE FEDERAL RESERVE WANTED TO CUT

46:01 INTEREST RATES.

46:08 LISTENING TO YOU, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU THINK CHAIRMAN POWELL

46:11 IS CONSTANTLY MOVING THE GOAL POST BECAUSE HE WANTS TO REDUCE

46:14 INTEREST RATES?

46:15 >> IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE THE SAME

46:16 DATA. THEY WOULD ALSO BE AWARE OF

46:20 THINGS LIKE THE LABOR MARKET STILL BREAKING LINEARLY.

46:22 THERE ARE HIGHER RATES THAT HURT THE ECONOMY.

46:26 IF THEY WANT TO BRING DOWN REAL RATES AND STICK A LANDING, THEY

46:27 PROBABLY HAVE TO START SOONER THAN LATER. INFLATION HAS BEEN

46:33 UNCOMFORTABLE THE LAST TWO MONTHS, IT LOOKS LIKE OF

46:35 COMMODITY PRICES DON'T DECLINE, WE WILL NOT GET THE NEXT WAVE

46:37 DOWN UNLESS YOU SEE WEAKNESS IN THE JOB MARKET.

46:41 I THINK WHAT WORRIES HIM IS IF HE HAS TO GO BACK TO WHERE HE

46:47 WAS AT JACKSON HOLE IN 2022 AND BREAK THE LABOR MARKET TO GET

46:50 INFLATION DOWN TO 2% OR DO I WANT TO STICK THE LANDING?

46:53 I THINK IT'S THIS BIAS WITHIN HIM.

46:56 IS HE OK TO ALLOW A RECESSION OR NOT THAT'S PROBABLY MORE

46:57 IMPORTANT. LISA: DO YOU BUY STOCKS?

47:04 >> I THINK YOU BY SELECT STOCKS AND YOU SPEAK TO YOUR EQUITY

47:08 STOCK PICKERS WHO CAN FIND GOOD COMPANIES THAT NAVIGATE THIS

47:09 TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT. ON BALANCE, I LIKE FIXED INCOME

47:13 MORE IN THIS MARKET. A LOT OF PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE

47:19 BANK OF JAPAN AND IT WAS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE THE BULK OF

47:21 MY CAREER HAS BEEN TRYING TO CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT FIXED

47:22 INCOME IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF YOUR ALLOCATION.

47:25 THAT WAS DIFFICULT IN A NEGATIVE RATES ENVIRONMENT.

47:30 NOW WE ARE AT A TIPPING POINT WHERE YOU CAN SEE THE BENEFITS

47:32 OF FIXED INCOME IN TERMS OF POTENTIAL PRICE RETURNS AND

47:34 INCOME RETURNS. THAT STORY HAS BECOME MORE

47:36 INTERESTING TO ME. LISA:

47:38 IF THE YEN WEAKENS CONSISTENTLY, WILL BUYERS FLOOD

47:43 BACK TO THE U.S. CREDIT MARKET?

47:46 >> IT'S A POSSIBILITY BUT CREDIT MAKES ME NERVOUS AS WE

47:50 HEAD INTO WHAT I THINK IS A HIGH RECESSION PRICE. JONATHAN:

47:54 IT'S A PRETTY FASCINATING FED DECISION AND VERY DIFFERENT TO

47:59 THE FED DECISION WE THOUGHT WE WOULD GET THREE OR FOUR MONTHS

48:03 AGO WHEN MARCH WAS THE DATE, THAT WAS THE SPOT THEY WOULD

48:10 REDUCE INTEREST RATES.

48:12 >> I REMEMBER IT BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK THE DATA WOULD

48:16 DETERIORATE. IF YOU LOOK BACK OVER HISTORY,

48:18 WHEN THE FED HAS PAUSED FOR PIVOTED, WE'VE SEEN A

48:19 SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF VOLATILITY IN FIXED INCOME

48:20 AROUND THAT TIME. BIG BETS AT THIS MOMENT

48:23 HISTORICALLY HAVE NOT BEEN A GREAT IDEA.

48:28 MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE'VE GOT TO KNOW WHAT THE FED'S

48:29 DECISION-MAKING FUNCTION IS. YOU CAN BUILD YOUR OWN AND

48:33 BUILD A FUNCTION FOR THE FEDERAL RESERVE.

48:37 WE'VE GOT TO KNOW WHAT HE'S WATCHING AND THE MOST IMPORTANT

48:39 THING TODAY IS GIVE ME SOME DATA POINTS, GIVE ME SOME

48:41 INSIGHT INTO THAT AND THEN WE CAN BUILD OUT A BETTER FORECAST

48:43 FOR THE FED FOR THE REST OF THIS YEAR. JONATHAN:

48:50 WE ARE NOT ASKING FOR MUCH, JAY.THIS WAS BRILLIANT, THANK

48:58 YOU.

48:59 BLACKROCK IS COMING UP AND MICHAEL SHEPPARD AND THE

49:03 COMMODITY MARKET AND THE CHANGE WE'VE SEEN IN CRUDE LATELY.

49:08 LISA: I'M GOING TO GO HOME AND SAY WE

49:11 ARE NOT GOING TO BUILD A BEAR BUT WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A FED

49:13 FUNCTION AND THE KIDS WILL BE EXCITED. JONATHAN:

49:16 WE WILL ALL BE BUILDING FED MODELS. LISA:

49:18 I WILL REPORT BACK TOMORROW. JONATHAN:

49:20 FROM NEW YORK CITY, THIS IS BLOOMBERG. ♪

49:42 >> FEDERAL FOCUS IS GOING TO BE WHAT TO THEY WANT TO DO WITH

49:45 THE SETTING OF INTEREST RATE POLICY?

49:48 HOW MUCH DO THEY WANT TO KEEP RATES AT CURRENT LEVELS.

49:52 >> WE KNOW MARCH IS OFF THE TABLE. MAY IS OFF THE TABLE.

49:57 WILL BE TALKING ABOUT CUTTING RATES IN THE SUMMER.

50:01 >> THE MEDIAN STAYS AT THREE CUTS.

50:05 >> I THINK THE FED IS SEEING ENOUGH THAT WE'LL GET THEM TO A

50:06 CUT IN JUNE.

50:12 >> THE BASELINE REMAINS TWO OR THREE CUTS STARTING IN JUNE.

50:13 >> THIS IS "BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE"

50:14 WITH JONATHAN FERRO, LISA ABRAMOWICZ, AND ANNMARIE

50:15 HORDERN. JONATHAN: THIS YEAR HAS ALREADY TURNED A

50:20 LOT OF CALLS UPSIDE DOWN. LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY, GOOD

50:25 MORNING, GOOD MORNING. EQUITIES JUST A TOUCH SOFTER ON

50:29 THE S&P 500. COMING INTO WEDNESDAY AT

50:36 ALL-TIME HIGHS GOING INTO A FIT DECISION WITH CREDIT SPREADS

50:39 TIGHT AND YIELDS JUST OFF THE HIGHS FOR 2024 ON A TWO YEAR

50:40 AND A 10 YEAR. WE JUST CAUGHT UP WITH FRANCES

50:44 DONALD. SHE PUT IT BROCCOLI. -- SHE PUT IT BLUNTLY.

50:51 CHAIRMAN POWELL, TELL US WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT. LISA:

50:55 WHICH DATA ARE THEY WATCHING? WILL WE BE FOCUSING ON THE

50:58 UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN SENTIMENT SURVEY OR WILL WOULD

51:02 BE FOCUSING ON JOLTS AND QUIT NUMBERS?

51:06 WHICH DATA WILL THEY MASSAGE TO GIVE A VIEW THAT COULD BE

51:07 DOVISH OR HAWKISH? JONATHAN: HOW DEPENDABLE IS THAT ECONOMIC

51:12 DATA? THINK ABOUT THE PAYROLLS REPORT.

51:19 YOU LOOK AT FEBRUARY AND YOU START TO LOOK AT THE LABOR

51:21 MARKET IN DIFFERENT WAYS. YOU CAN PICK YOUR BASKET OF

51:25 GOODS AND SERVICES UNTIL WHATEVER STORY YOU WANT TO TELL.

51:28 WHAT IS THE BIAS OF THIS FEDERAL RESERVE?

51:36 LISA: CAN THEY JUSTIFY IT GIVEN THE

51:38 FACT THAT WE HAVE SEEN HOT PRINT AFTER HOT PRINT WHEN IT

51:40 COMES TO INFLATION? THAT IS WHY PEOPLE ARE WATCHING

51:47 AND FRANCIS PUT THIS REALLY WELL .

51:50 IF THEY MOVE IT DOWN TO TWO RATE CUTS FOR THIS YEAR THAT

51:55 INDICATES A MORE HAWKISH TONE, BUT ALSO 2025, 2026, ARE THEY

51:59 SEEING THEIR ABILITY TO CUT RATES THAT SIGNIFICANTLY

52:03 CRIMPED BY THE FACT INFLATION IS STICKIER THAN THEY EXPECTED.

52:06 JONATHAN: HAVE TO TRY TO CALL THE FED AND

52:08 WORK OUT WHAT THE MARKET WILL DO.

52:12 IF YOU CALL THINGS CORRECTLY SO FAR THIS YEAR I'M NOT SURE YOU

52:13 HAVE GOTTEN TWO. EVEN AS WE PRIZE OUT FEDERAL

52:18 RESERVE INTEREST RATE CUTS. ANOTHER GREAT EXAMPLE.

52:22 GETTING THE MARKET CALL RIGHT. BANK OF JAPAN.

52:27 MADE THE CALL THIS YEAR WE WOULD GET THE FIRST INTEREST

52:31 RATE HIKE SINCE 2007. WOULD YOU HAVE THE JAPANESE YEN

52:36 AS THE WORST-PERFORMING CURRENCY ? LISA:

52:41 POTENTIALLY THE WEAKEST GOING BACK TO 1990 VERSUS THE DOLLAR.

52:45 YOU LOOK AT THE WEAKNESS IN THE YEN. IS IT A FUNCTION OF JAPAN?

52:52 OR IS A FUNCTION OF KING DOLLAR AND THE IDEA THE U.S.

52:53 STRENGTH HAS BEEN EXCEPTIONAL? DO YOUR POINT ABOUT GETTING THE

52:58 MARKET CALL RIGHT THE NARRATIVES ARE MIND SPINNING.

53:03 DO YOU LISTEN TO JAY POWELL? THESE ARE THE POLAR ASPECTS OF

53:07 THIS MARKET. YOU FOCUS ON TECHNOLOGICAL

53:13 ADVANCEMENT OR FISCAL SPENDING OR YOU FOCUS ON A FEDERAL

53:15 RESERVE THAT IS PLAYING CATCH-UP WITH ALL OF THESE

53:20 METRICS. JONATHAN:

53:21 THE LAST 12 MONTHS BETTER OFF FOLLOWING JENSEN THAN JAY

53:22 POWELL BASED ON WHAT NVIDIA HAS DONE. DOLLAR-YEN, SEVEN DAYS OF

53:25 WEAKNESS. THE BROADER PRICE ACTION

53:28 ELSEWHERE. EQUITIES UNCHANGED. PRECISELY UNCHANGED.

53:36 YIELDS ARE DOWN ONE BASIS POINT ON THE 10 YEAR.

53:40 IN FOREIGN-EXCHANGE THE DOLLAR STRONGER AGAINST EVERYTHING IN

53:43 G10 THROUGH MUCH OF THIS MORNING.

53:48 EURO-DOLLAR 108 -- 1.0 843. COMING UP, WAIT LEO BLACKROCK,

53:57 GREG PETERS -- WEI LI BLACKROCK, GREG PETERS AND

54:00 NADYA MARTIN WIGAN.

54:08 S&P 500 BACK TO ANOTHER ALL-TIME HIGH AHEAD OF TODAY'S

54:09 FIT DECISION. WEI LI A BLACKROCK WRITING "WE

54:15 THINK UPBEAT SENTIMENT CAN PERSIST. WE LEAN INTO THE AI

54:20 THEME AZTEC DRIVES CORPORATE EARNINGS GROWTH.

54:23 WE SEE FED POLICY RATE STAYING HIGHER AS INFLATION SETTLES

54:26 CLOSER TO 3%." WEI LI IS WITH US NOW.

54:32 I WANT TO GO STRAIGHT TO THAT INFLATION CALL.

54:35 ESSENTIALLY WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS INFLATION DOWN A BIT

54:38 MORE , THAN BACK UP TOWARDS THE END OF THE YEAR.

54:42 ARE WE SEEING THAT PICKUP AHEAD OF SCHEDULE? WEI:

54:45 THAT IS POSSIBLE.

54:51 I WOULD NOTE THE INFLATION UPSIDE SURPRISES CAME FROM

54:52 DIFFERENT SOURCES. THE JANUARY PRINT WAS BECAUSE

54:56 OF POOR SERVICE AND THE FEBRUARY PRINT WAS DRIVEN BY

55:01 HOTTER THAN EXPECTED GOODS INFLATIONARY PRESSURES.

55:05 I THINK THE JURY IS STILL OUT IN TERMS OF IF WE ARE SEEING

55:09 THE TROUGH OF THIS INFLATION ROLLER COASTER.

55:15 OUR VIEW IS THERE IS ROOM FOR GOODS DEFLATION TO BRING

55:16 INFLATION DOWN FURTHER.

55:22 WHEN THAT RUNS ITS COURSE, WHICH IS MORE LIKELY LATER THIS

55:25 YEAR RATHER THAN NOW, SERVICE STARTS TO DOMINATE AND THAT IS

55:30 WHEN WAGE PRESSURE PUSHES INFLATION HIGHER IN THE TREND

55:36 IS SETTLING AROUND 3% RATHER THAN 2%.

55:39 THE ROLLER COASTER IS FOR LATER THIS YEAR RATHER THAN RIGHT NOW.

55:43 RIGHT NOW I THINK THE BAR IS PRETTY HIGH FOR MARKETS TO

55:49 ABANDON THIS NARRATIVE OF DISINFLATION WHICH IS WHY WE

55:53 ARE STABLE RISK SENTIMENT AND STABLE -- JONATHAN:

55:58 HOW DO YOU THINK THAT WILL INFLUENCE THE THINKING OF

55:59 CHAIRMAN POWELL IN TODAY'S NEWS CONFERENCE? WEI:

56:04 IT WILL BE A VERY BALANCED PRESS CONFERENCE, AND A VERY

56:05 BALANCED FOMC. THEY WILL EMPHASIZE DATA

56:10 DEPENDENCY AND TRY TO STRIKE A BALANCE TONE.

56:12 LAST MEETING THEY TALKED ABOUT A STICKY LAST MILE.

56:17 I AM VERY CURIOUS IN TERMS OF HOW THEY SPEAK TO THE RECENT

56:21 UPSIDE SURPRISES IN INFLATION PRINT.

56:23 I'M ALSO CURIOUS IF THEY WILL REVISE GROWTH HIGHER, INFLATION

56:26 HIGHER. THEY WILL START DISCUSSING THE

56:33 FED BALANCE SHEETS.

56:39 WE ARE EXPECTING THE DOT MEDIAN TO STAY AT THREE CUTS WHICH IS

56:42 IN LINE WITH OUR EXPECTATION AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR.

56:45 MARKETS FINALLY MOVING CLOSER TO THAT. LISA:

56:51 WHAT DURATION OF BONDS DO YOU FEEL IS MOST VULNERABLE GIVEN

56:54 WHERE PRICING IS AND GIVEN WHAT YOU EXPECT TO TRANSPIRE WITH

56:55 INFLATION LATER THIS YEAR? WEI: WE HAVE A PREFERENCE FOR THE

57:00 SHORT END OF THE CURVE AND ALSO THE BELLY OF THE CURVE.

57:07 THERE IS A STEEPENING VIEW OVER THE LONGER-TERM AND THERE IS

57:09 MORE OF A FISCAL STORY. IF YOU LOOK AT THE FISCAL

57:17 DEFICIT IN THE U.S., LATE 2022 WE ARE LOOKING AT 3.5% AND NOW

57:21 WE ARE GETTING TO 8% AND THAT COST IS INCREASING, EXPECTED TO

57:24 INCREASE EVEN MORE. HIGHER RATES FOR LONGER.

57:35 ALL OF THAT POINTS TO HIGHER RATES, ESPECIALLY FOR THE LONG

57:36 END OF THE CURVE.

57:42 WHEN THAT KICKS IN, WHEN THE REPRICING BECAUSE OF CONCERN

57:45 AROUND FISCAL DYNAMICS AND THAT SERVICEABILITY, THAT IS KEY,

57:49 WHICH IS WHY OUR CONVICTION ON THE LONG END OF THE CURVE IS

57:55 STRONGER OVER A STRATEGIC HORIZON THEN OVER A TACTICAL

57:57 HORIZON OF SIX TO 12 MONTHS. LISA:

58:04 ARE STOCKS VULNERABLE TO A HAWKISH SURPRISE FROM THE FED

58:07 OR THEY OPERATING ON A DIFFERENT SET OF RULES THAT

58:09 HINGE ON DIFFERENT FACTORS? WEI: YOU ASKED A QUESTION, JAY

58:16 POWELL VERSUS JENSEN AND THAT IS WHAT STOCKMARKETS MARKETS

58:17 ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. WE HAVE HAD HAWKISH REPRICING

58:20 OF THE FED. SEVEN CUTS AT THE BEGINNING OF

58:24 THE YEAR TO NOW JUST THREE CUTS. MARKETS ARE VERY RESILIENT.

58:31 THE S&P IS UP CLOSE TO 9%. EQUAL WEIGHT S&P CLOSE TO 5%.

58:41 THIS IS NOT A MARKET CAVING IN UNDER HAWKISH REPRICING

58:45 PRESSURE AND THE RECONCILIATION OR A FACTOR IS THE STRONG

58:50 EARNINGS AND A LOT OF THE EARNINGS ARE BEING HEAVY

58:53 LIFTERS BY THE AI THEME, WHICH IS WHY WE ARE POSITIVE ON THE

58:55 U.S. EQUITY MARKET BECAUSE EARNINGS

58:59 ARE COMING IN STRONG AND BEATING EXPECTATIONS.

59:04 WE LEAN INTO AI BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE MOST OF THE EARNINGS

59:06 MOMENTUM IS COMING FROM. LISA: DO YOU THINK CALLS FOR SOME

59:11 SORT OF BROADENING OUT IN THE RALLY ARE PREMATURE BECAUSE THE

59:18 GAINS ARE STILL CONCENTRATED , NOT JUST WITH THE MAGNIFICENT

59:20 FOUR OR THREE OR WHATEVER HAVE GOTTEN IT DOWN TO, BUT ONLY THE

59:26 COMPANY THAT ARE MOST LEVERAGE TO IMMEDIATE BENEFITS FROM SOME

59:27 OF THIS TECHNOLOGY? WEI: I THINK THERE IS ROOM FOR THE

59:37 S&P TO BROADEN OUT FROM THE CONCENTRATED LEADERSHIP WE SAW

59:38 FROM THE MOST PART OF LAST YEAR. THAT CAN ALSO BE THANKS TO AI.

59:45 AS WE THINK ABOUT SECTORS LIKE HEALTH CARE AND INDUSTRIALS

59:50 STARTING TO ADOPT AI INTO A GREATER SALE, THE LEADERS

59:53 WITHIN THOSE SECTORS ARE ABLE TO BROADEN THE GAP VERSUS THE

59:57 REST OF THE PEERS. THEY HAVE THE ECONOMY OF SCALE.

01:00:02 THEY HAVE DATA TO PLAY WITH.

01:00:08 WE CAN CAI BROADENING AT -- WE CAN SEE AI BROADENING OUT THE

01:00:10 RALLY. THAT IS ONE WAY IT CAN BROADEN

01:00:13 OUT. THE OTHER WAY IT CAN BROADEN

01:00:19 OUT IS A WILD SWING OF LABOR PRICING.

01:00:21 WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THREE CUTS. AT THE PEAK HAWKISH MOMENT OF

01:00:26 OCTOBER MARKETS WERE STILL LOOKING AT TWO CUTS.

01:00:32 WE ARE SEEING A WIDE RANGE OF RATE REPRICING, WHICH IS ALSO

01:00:37 EVIDENCE OF THE ELEVATED VOLATILITY.

01:00:41 THERE IS NO TELLING IF WE COULD SEE A SWING BACK UP THIS RATE

01:00:44 REPRICING AND WHAT THAT TACTICAL MOMENTUM PLAYS OUT

01:00:50 THAT COULD BENEFIT THE BROADER MARKET BEYOND THE AI

01:00:52 CONCENTRATED THEME. THAT IS SO SHORT-TERM BECAUSE

01:00:57 WE HAVE SEEN A WILD SWING WITHIN SHORT PERIODS OF TIME,

01:01:00 THAT IS NOT SOMETHING WE ARE POSITIONING INVESTMENT AROUND

01:01:03 BUT WE ACKNOWLEDGE THIS CAN SWING WITHIN THE SHORT TIME.

01:01:06 ANNMARIE: I KNOW YOUR OVER -- JONATHAN:

01:01:09 I KNOW YOUR OVERWEIGHT U.S. EQUITIES BUT ALSO A SPRINKLE OF

01:01:14 JAPANESE STOCKS. THE NIKKEI IS UP ALMOST 25%.

01:01:18 CAN YOU TELL ME HOW THE BANK OF JAPAN IS RELEVANT TO THAT

01:01:19 DECISION? WEI: IT IS THE PREREQUISITE ON WHICH

01:01:28 THE MICRO STORY CAN PLAY OUT, WHICH IS OUR EXPECTATION AND

01:01:32 RATIONALE BEHIND OUR JAPANESE CALL.

01:01:35 WE UPGRADED JAPAN TWICE LAST YEAR AND WE CONTINUE TO LIKE IT

01:01:38 AT THIS JUNCTURE EVEN AS IT CROSSED THE ALL-TIME HIGH FROM

01:01:43 1989. YESTERDAY WAS A KEY EVENT TO

01:01:47 WATCH. IF THEY ARE VERY HAWKISH, VIEWING INFLATION AS A PROBLEM,

01:01:52 I WOULD BE SOMEWHAT CONCERNED WITH OUR JAPAN CALL.

01:01:57 FRANKLY THEY HIKED RATES FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 17 YEARS BUT

01:02:01 THEY HIKED IT IN THE MOST DOVISH WAY POSSIBLE.

01:02:06 THEY NORMALLY DROPPED THE YIELD CURVE CONTROL BUT THEY ARE

01:02:10 STILL SAYING IN CASE OF A RAPID RISE IN LONG-TERM YIELDS THEY

01:02:14 WOULD MAKE MEANINGFUL ADJUSTMENTS.

01:02:17 IF THAT IS NOT THE DEFINITION OF WAIT-AND-SEE I DO NOT KNOW

01:02:20 WHAT IS. THEY ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE AND

01:02:26 ACCOMMODATIVE AND THAT TAKES AWAY FROM MICRO DEVELOPMENTS TO

01:02:29 CONTINUE TO BE REFLECTED. JONATHAN: THANK YOU.

01:02:35 WE HAVE BEEN ASKING THE QUESTION WHERE DOES IT LEAVE

01:02:37 THE CALL AND JAPANESE STOCKS IF THE YEN STARTS TO STRENGTHEN?

01:02:43 WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ASKING WHERE DOES IT LEAVE THE CALL IF

01:02:44 THE YEN CONTINUES WEAKENING?

01:02:50 WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL DAYS OF JAPANESE -- WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL

01:02:51 DAYS OF YEN WEAKNESS.

01:02:57 LONG MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, MOST CROWDED TRADE, 58%.

01:03:00 SHORT CHINESE EQUITIES, 14%. LONG JAPAN EQUITIES, 13%.

01:03:07 NOT AS CROWDED AS I FELT BASED ON THAT. LISA:

01:03:11 BASED ON THE FACT THAT PEOPLE COME ON AND WE CHALLENGE THEM

01:03:14 TO THAT IDEA, EVERYONE IS LONG JAPANESE EQUITIES.

01:03:18 IT HAS REACHED A RECORD HIGH FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 1989.

01:03:22 NOT AS IF WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO WITH CERTAIN COMPANIES,

01:03:23 TOYOTA INCLUDED. JONATHAN: THINGS HAVE BEEN CHANGING THERE

01:03:27 FOR A WHILE. THE NIKKEI UP CLOSE TO 20%.

01:03:33 HERE IS YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF. YAHAIRA:

01:03:37 ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENNETT SHOULD BEEN NET YAHOO!

01:03:41 IS SET TO SPEAK WITH SENATE REPUBLIC -- PRIME MINISTER

01:03:43 BENJAMIN NETANYAHU IS SAID TO SPEAK WITH SENATE REPUBLICANS

01:03:47 DAYS AFTER CHUCK SCHUMER CALLED FOR ELECTIONS TO REPLACE

01:03:51 BENJAMIN NETANYAHU. ISRAEL AND U.S.

01:03:55 DEMOCRATS ARE SEEING A GROWING RIFT OVER ISRAEL'S NEED TO

01:03:59 ENTER THE GAZA CITY OF RAFAH, WITH BENJAMIN NETANYAHU SAYING

01:04:03 HE SEES NO WAY TO DESTROY HAMAS WITHOUT INVADING THE CITY.

01:04:08 INFLATION IN THE U.K. FALLING MORE SHARPLY THAN

01:04:11 EXPECTED, PULLING TO THE LOWEST LEVEL IN 2.5 YEARS.

01:04:14 THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX ROSE FROM A YEAR EARLIER.

01:04:18 THAT IS SLOWER THAN THE 4% PAYS THE MONTH BEFORE.

01:04:23 ECONOMISTS SAY THE DATA KEEPS THE BANK OF ENGLAND ON TRACK TO

01:04:24 REDUCE INTEREST RATES LATER THIS YEAR.

01:04:32 CARING SHARES ARE PLUNGING -- KERING SHARES ARE PLUNGING.

01:04:37 THE COMPANY WARNS SHARES OF GUCCI WILL DROP.

01:04:40 THE COMPANY IS STRUGGLING TO KEEP UP WITH RIVALS LIKE LVMH

01:04:46 AND HERMES AS LUXURY SALES HAVE PULLED, ESPECIALLY IN CHINA.

01:04:48 JONATHAN: UP NEXT, WILL THE FEDERAL

01:04:51 RESERVE OPEN THE DOOR TO HIGHER BOND YIELDS?

01:04:55 >> THEY ONLY SHOW TWO CUTS FOR THIS YEAR.

01:04:58 WE THINK YOU WILL SEE THE CURVE FLATTENING.

01:05:03 IF THEY SEE THREE CUTS THE TWO WILL PROBABLY RALLY. JONATHAN:

01:05:07 THAT CONVERSATION IS UP NEXT. ♪

01:06:00 JONATHAN: STOCKS TURNING POSITIVE IN THE

01:06:03 LAST COUPLE OF MINUTES BY NOT EVEN .1%.

01:06:06 ALL-TIME HIGHS ON THE S&P COMING INTO A FEDERAL RESERVE

01:06:10 THAT WILL NOT CUT INTEREST RATES IN THE MINDS OF PRE-MUCH

01:06:13 EVERYBODY FORECAST. YIELDS LOWER BY A SINGLE BASIS POINT.

01:06:17 OPENING THE DOOR TO HIGHER BOND YIELDS.

01:06:22 >> THEY ONLY SHOW TWO CUTS FOR THIS YEAR SO THEY TAKE OUT ONE

01:06:23 CUT. WE THINK THE TWO YEAR WILL SELLOFF.

01:06:29 WE THINK YOU'LL SEE THE DOLLAR RALLY AND WE THINK YOU WILL SEE

01:06:30 RISK ASSETS TAKE IT ON THE CHIN. IF THEY SHOW THREE CUTS AS THEY

01:06:37 HAD IN DECEMBER, WE THINK THE TWO YEAR WILL PROBABLY RALLY

01:06:39 FIVE BASIS POINTS AND YOU WILL SEE THE DOLLAR WEAKEN.

01:06:46 JONATHAN: BOND TRADERS STEPPING UP BEDS

01:06:49 AGAINST TREASURIES, POSITIONING THEMSELVES FOR A HAWKISH

01:06:51 MESSAGE FROM JAY POWELL. GREG PETERS WRITING "WE ARE

01:06:56 STILL IN THE STRATEGIC BY ZONE FOR BONDS.

01:06:59 YIELDS ON INVESTMENT GRADE INDICES ARE COMPARABLE TO YEAR

01:07:06 END 2022 LEVELS AND CENTRAL BANKS ARE IN ALL LIKELIHOOD

01:07:07 DONE RAISING INTEREST RATES." BREAK IS WITH US NOW.

01:07:13 LET'S GHOST -- GREG IS WITH US NOW. LET'S GO STRAIGHT TO THE

01:07:16 TREASURY MARKET. BACK NEAR 4.70 ON THE FRONT END

01:07:19 OF THE CURVE. IS THAT A BUY FOR YOU? GREG:

01:07:25 I THINK WE ARE IN THE ZONE. WHETHER RATES RALLY OR NOT

01:07:28 MISSES THE POINT. IT IS ABOUT THE YIELD YOU

01:07:31 RECEIVE. AS A FIXED INCOME INVESTOR AT

01:07:39 THESE YIELD LEVELS IT IS A VERY ATTRACTIVE PROPOSITION.

01:07:43 OUR TAGLINE FOR THE YEAR IS YIELD IS DESTINY.

01:07:47 I THINK YOU WIN HAVING THE YIELD INCOME IN THE DOOR AND IF

01:07:52 THERE IS A BLIP IN THE ECONOMY YOU FINALLY HAVE THE PROTECTIVE

01:07:54 MEASURE OF OWNING DURATION.

01:08:00 I WILL NOT SAY IT IS A WIN-WIN BUT IT IS AN ATTRACTIVE

01:08:01 INVESTMENT INDEED. JONATHAN: HOW DO YOU CONVINCE PEOPLE WHO

01:08:05 SAY I GET ALL THAT BUT I THINK YIELDS ARE GOING UP, CRUDE

01:08:09 CUTTING CLOSE TO $90 AGAIN, I THINK I SHOULD WAIT, I THINK I

01:08:13 CAN GET AN EXTRA 20 BASIS POINTS FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD.

01:08:16 WHAT YOU SAY? GREG: TIMING THE MARKET IS QUITE

01:08:19 CHALLENGING. WHERE WE ARE FROM A STARTING

01:08:22 POINT MATTERS A LOT.

01:08:25 THE BREAKEVEN OF THE YIELDS MOVING HIGHER IS QUITE

01:08:32 ATTRACTIVE AS WELL. YOU WILL NEVER TIME IT.

01:08:38 AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT IS A VERY ATTRACTIVE INVESTMENT.

01:08:44 YOU HAVE THE PROTECTIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF FIXED INCOME

01:08:47 IF AND WHEN THE ECONOMY DOES ROLL OVER. LISA:

01:08:52 YIELD IS DESTINY, I WANT TO MAKE A T-SHIRT THAT SAYS THAT.

01:08:56 YOU TALK ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY LATER THIS YEAR OF A TAPER

01:08:59 TANTRUM WITH A NEGATIVE RATINGS DEVELOPMENT.

01:09:03 HOW DOES THAT NEGATIVE SIDE OF THINGS FEATURE INTO YIELD IS

01:09:05 DESTINY WHEN YOU'RE TALKING TO CLIENTS? GREG:

01:09:10 THAT IS A RISK FACTOR, NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

01:09:14 I WANT TO BE OPEN AND HONEST. WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

01:09:17 SUPPLY HITTING THE SYSTEM. THERE IS SUCH A FOCUS ON FED

01:09:21 POLICY. I DO BELIEVE MARKETS WERE

01:09:27 LEANING THE OTHER WAY, REALLY EMBRACING RATE CUTS TOO EARLY.

01:09:31 I THINK WE ARE IN A MUCH MORE NATURAL STATE TODAY THAN WHERE

01:09:34 WE WERE AT THE START OF THE YEAR. IT IS A RISK.

01:09:40 WANT TO BE EYES WIDE OPEN TO THOSE RISKS.

01:09:43 IT IS SO MUCH FUNDING OF THE DEFICIT.

01:09:47 YOU HAVE TO BE FOCUSED ON THAT POTENTIAL PROBLEM. LISA:

01:09:53 IT IS THE REASON WHY WE FOCUS ON OPTIONS.

01:09:56 I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE IDEA THAT IT'S LIKE AN ATTRACTIVE

01:09:58 BUY. DOES THE FED MATTER TO YOU? DOES ANYTHING THE FED SAYS

01:10:05 TODAY GOING TO SHIFT THAT FEW ONE WAY OR THE OTHER BECAUSE

01:10:08 THE MARKET IS MOVING AWAY FROM THE FED AND THE FED IS

01:10:10 FOLLOWING IT? GREG: I THINK THERE IS WAY TOO MUCH

01:10:14 FOCUS ON THE FED. AT THE END OF THE DAY IT IS

01:10:17 ABOUT THE DATA. THE DATA MATTERS.

01:10:23 THE MARKETS WERE SO OBSESSED WITH RATE CUTS.

01:10:26 THE ONLY WAY THE RISK MARKETS COULD DO BETTER IS IF THE FED

01:10:29 CUT RATES. IT IS ABOUT THE DATA. THE UNDERLYING DATA IS STRONG.

01:10:39 I WOULD FOCUS ON LABOR MARKETS 10 TIMES OVER THE FED.

01:10:42 I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING TO DO FOCUSING ON JAY POWELL AND

01:10:44 THE FED. AT THE END OF THE DAY IT IS

01:10:47 LABOR. JONATHAN: CAN WE FINISH ON THE BANK OF

01:10:51 JAPAN? I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE BOJ.

01:10:57 IT IS THE LAST ANCHOR AROUND THE NECK OF THE GLOBAL FIXED

01:10:59 INCOME MARKET BE LIFTED. WE'VE SEEN THE FED SHIFT.

01:11:04 WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT NOT JUST THE NEXT FIVE MINUTES, THE NEXT

01:11:09 SIX TO 12 MONTHS, THE NEXT 10 YEARS, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO

01:11:11 LOOK LIKE COMPARED TO WHAT WE DID LOOK LIKE OVER THE PREVIOUS

01:11:13 DECADE OR SO? GREG: YOU COULD SEE THE SITUATION

01:11:19 WHERE JAPAN RISES FROM THE ASHES, FINALLY.

01:11:22 WHAT WE GOT YESTERDAY OUT OF THE BOJ IS MOVING POLICY OUT OF

01:11:27 NEGATIVE TERRITORY BUT THAT'S IT. YOU ARE CONTINUING TO SEE A

01:11:36 WEEK YAN -- YOUR CONTINUED TO SEE A WEAK YEN.

01:11:40 YOU WILL SEE FLOWS INTO JAPAN. THERE IS ALL THIS TALK AROUND

01:11:44 EQUITY MARKETS IN JAPAN. MOST EQUITY MARKETS HAVE SHIED

01:11:49 AWAY BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN TWO DECADES OF DISAPPOINTMENTS.

01:11:54 THIS IS AN EARLY STAGE OF MOVEMENT IN JAPANESE MARKETS

01:11:56 AND WHAT YOU WILL SEE IS THIS MUCH LOWER RATE REGIME RELATIVE

01:12:00 TO ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD AND I THINK THAT WILL FUEL FDI

01:12:05 AND PUSH THAT MARKET HIGHER. JONATHAN:

01:12:10 JAPANESE INVESTORS HAD TO LOOK FOR INCOME ELSEWHERE.

01:12:13 CERTAIN EUROPEAN MARKETS ARE VULNERABLE.

01:12:15 I'M TRYING TO WORK OUT HOW THE FLOWS WILL DEVELOP.

01:12:19 HOW DO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT WILL HAPPEN? GREG:

01:12:23 ON THE MARGIN YOU WILL SEE THAT PULLBACK.

01:12:25 VERY MUCH ON THE MARGIN. LOOK AT THE INTEREST RATE

01:12:28 DIFFERENTIALS. IF YOU LOOK AT YIELDS IN JAPAN

01:12:34 RELATIVE TO ANYWHERE ELSE OR MOST JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE OF

01:12:37 JAPAN, THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT PICKUP.

01:12:41 I DO NOT SEE A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT. THERE IS A NATURAL BIAS.

01:12:46 THAT IS MORE ON THE RISK EQUITY SIDE THAN ON THE FIXED INCOME

01:12:47 SIDE. ON THE MARGIN, YES. I DO NOT THINK IT IS ANYTHING

01:12:52 DRAMATIC. JONATHAN: GREG PETERS OF PGIM FIXED

01:12:56 INCOME. A BIT OF A CLINIC ON FIXED

01:12:58 INCOME.

01:13:04 JAN HATZIUS OF GOLDMAN SACHS COMING ON TO ANTICIPATE THE

01:13:05 FEDERAL RESERVE. WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THE

01:13:07 FED.

01:13:08 TO GREG'S POINT, THIS YEAR, GDP, NOMINAL GDP

01:13:17 BETTER-THAN-EXPECTED. EQUITIES HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO

01:13:20 THAT NOISE AND IGNORING THE BOND MARKET.

01:13:24 THE BOND MARKET WOULD'VE BEEN BETTER OFF WATCHING THE DATA

01:13:27 AND SPENDING LESS TIME TRYING TO GUESS THE FED. LISA:

01:13:32 THE DATA THEY ARE WATCHING IS INTERESTING.

01:13:34 GREG TALKING ABOUT LABOR MARKETS.

01:13:38 YOU WATCH THE QUITS RATES, TO WATCH THE NONFARM PAYROLLS

01:13:39 NUMBERS? JONATHAN: UP NEXT COME INTEL WINNING $20

01:13:47 BILLION IN AWARDS FOR CHIP GRANTS AND A PROGRAM DESIGNED

01:13:48 TO REINVIGORATE THE DOMESTIC INDUSTRY.

01:14:06 ♪ JONATHAN: ALL-TIME HIGHS ON THE S&P 500 GOING TO RESERVE

01:14:11 DECISION LATER ON THIS AFTERNOON POSITIVE BY 0.0 6%,

01:14:15 UP BY A QUARTER OF 1% ON THE NASDAQ 100.

01:14:21 PLENTY OF HEADLINES, THE TWO-YEAR, 10 YEAR REPRICING

01:14:27 HIGHER.

01:14:28 DOWN A SINGLE BASIS POINT ON A 10 YEAR MATURITY.

01:14:33 ON THE TWO-YEAR, A WONDERFUL TIME ON THE TRADING FLOOR WITH

01:14:36 BANK OF AMERICA AND THE TEAM JUST YESTERDAY.

01:14:38 THANK YOU A LOT TO EVERYONE WHO REACHED OUT.

01:14:41 A LOT OF THOSE INTERVIEWS YOU CAN FIND ONLINE.

01:14:45 AND THE POINT THAT MARK MADE THIS AN INTERESTING ONE, THAT

01:14:47 MAY BE THE SMOOTH INEQUITIES OPENS THE DOOR FOR YIELDS TO GO

01:14:50 HIGHER BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT GETTING PUSHBACK AT ALL. LISA:

01:14:54 IT IS NOT JUST EQUITIES, IT IS ALSO RISK ASSET WITHIN THE

01:14:55 CREDIT MARKETS. HIGH-YIELD BOND SPREADS ARE NOW

01:15:01 THE TIGHTEST. THE LOWEST GOING BACK TO JANUARY OF 2022.

01:15:05 THIS IS NOT A CONCERN ABOUT CREDIT RISK, SO IT RAISES THE

01:15:09 QUESTION, WHY CAN'T ABOUT BORROWING COSTCO A WHOLE LOT

01:15:11 HIGHER WITH AN ECONOMY THAT STILL IS CHUGGING ALONG?

01:15:15 JONATHAN: SPREADS ARE TIGHT, STOCKS ARE

01:15:17 AT ALL-TIME HIGHS. FRANCES DONALD IS WITH US ABOUT

01:15:20 40 MINUTES AGO. SHE WAS SAYING THE CHAIRMAN

01:15:24 NEEDS TO TELL US WHAT HE IS ACTUALLY LOOKING AT AND WE NEED

01:15:26 TO WORK OUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL CONDITIONS ARE

01:15:28 RELATIVE -- RELEVANT OR NOT. LISA:

01:15:31 IS IT OR ISN'T IT JUST FINGER IN THE WIND?

01:15:35 A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK IT IS AND IT IS BASICALLY PICK YOUR OWN

01:15:38 DATA INDICATED THAT IS GOING TO PAINT A STORY THAT FEELS GOOD

01:15:39 AT THAT MOMENT. IF THERE IS A SHIFT, HOW DO

01:15:43 THEY COMMUNICATE IT? JONATHAN: DOES THE YEN WEAKNESS MATTER?

01:15:49 LET'S TURN TO FOREIGN-EXCHANGE. THE DOLLAR-YEN RIGHT NOW, SEVEN

01:15:53 DAYS OF YEN WEAKNESS. WE'VE NOT SEEN A STREAK LIKE

01:15:58 THAT SINCE AUGUST OF 2023. BACK TO CLOSE TO 152.

01:16:03 AGAIN, BREAKING OUT BY ANOTHER 0.6% OR SO OFF THE BACK OF A

01:16:06 RATE HIKE BY THE BANK OF JAPAN. THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE A

01:16:12 PROBLEM FOR THE BOJ, THEY WILL BE COMFORTABLE WITH THIS.

01:16:15 SO LET'S WAIT AND SEE WHAT HEADLINES WE GET FROM JAPANESE

01:16:21 OFFICIALS.

01:16:22 LET'S SEE HOW MANY OF THOSE WE GET IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS.

01:16:25 LISA: FOR JAPAN, THEIR SYMMETRY OF

01:16:28 RISK IF THEY WANT MORE INFLATION.

01:16:31 THIS IS WHY I THINK THE HAND WILL BE CALLED POTENTIALLY A

01:16:33 LITTLE BIT MORE IF JEROME POWELL TODAY HAS A HAWKISH

01:16:34 MESSAGE. IF THE FED IS CONCERNED ABOUT

01:16:40 INFLATION AND WANTS TO RAISE RATES, THAT COULD POTENTIALLY

01:16:42 CAUSE MORE CAPITAL FLOWS INTO THE U.S.

01:16:44 AWAY FROM JAPAN LEADING TO THE YEN TO WEAKEN TO A POINT WHERE

01:16:47 THE BANK OF JAPAN HAS TO PAY ATTENTION, AND THAT MIGHT BE

01:16:51 THE WORST RISK CASE FOR SOME OF THE OFFICIALS THAT MIGHT BE

01:16:53 WHISPERING OFF THE RECORD TO SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE REPORTERS.

01:16:55 JONATHAN: POTENTIALLY MAYBE AT SOME POINT

01:16:56 IN THE FUTURE AGAIN. THOSE OF YOU FAMILIAR WITH

01:17:02 FOREIGN-EXCHANGE, YOU KNOW A 3% MOVE IN FOREIGN-EXCHANGE IS NOT

01:17:03 THE SAME AS EQUITIES. THAT IS A BIG MOVE.

01:17:09 COUNTING DOWN TO THE FED DECISION AT 2:00 P.M.

01:17:12 EASTERN TIME, THE CENTRAL BANK EXPECTED TO KEEP RATES ON HOLD

01:17:15 FOR A FIXED-RATE MEETING WITH INVESTORS LOOKING FOR CLUES ON

01:17:16 THE FED'S RATE CUT TIMELINE. PAL SAYING THE FED WAS NOT FAR

01:17:21 FROM THE LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE

01:17:27 NEEDED ON INFLATION TO ", BUT HARDER THAN EXPECTED INFLATION

01:17:29 PRINTS REINFORCING THE CASE OF CAUTION HERE GOING INTO THIS.

01:17:33 THIS IS WHAT IT IS GOING TO BE ABOUT, THAT CONFIDENCE LINE.

01:17:37 HOW DOES HE PHRASE THE LEVEL OF COMPETENCY HAS NOW RELATIVE TO

01:17:38 WHERE HE WAS AT THE START OF THE YEAR? LISA:

01:17:44 NUMBER ONE, HOW MUCH DO THEY REVISE UPWARD THE BENCHMARK

01:17:46 RATE FORECAST FOR 20 25 AND 2026? I WANT TO SEE THAT.

01:17:51 AND NUMBER TWO, HOW MUCH DOES HE PUSHBACK OR EVEN ADDRESS THE

01:17:53 FINANCIAL CONDITIONS QUESTION. IF HE DOESN'T, THAT WOULD BE SO

01:17:57 DOVISH, BASICALLY SAYING WE DON'T CARE ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY

01:18:01 RALLY. IF HE DOES, IT INDICATES MAYBE

01:18:03 THEY ARE GETTING A LITTLE BIT MORE NERVOUS THAT THE MARKET IS

01:18:04 MOVING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.

01:18:08 >> HE WILL GET THE STATEMENT AND THE SUMMARY.

01:18:12 30 MINUTES LATER YOU WILL HEAR FROM THE CHAIRMAN HIMSELF.

01:18:17 JP MORGAN LIFTING ITS QUARTERLY DIVIDEND BY 9.5 PERCENT

01:18:20 FOLLOWING RECORD ANNUAL PROFIT AND REGULATORS SIGNALING THEY

01:18:22 MAY RETHINK PROPOSALS FOR TIGHTER CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.

01:18:24 SECOND TIME IN THE PAST YEAR THE BANK HAS USED ITS QUARTERLY

01:18:25 PAYOUT. IN THE ANNOUNCEMENT, JAMIE

01:18:30 DIMON DID NOT PROVIDE A REASON FOR THE INCREASE.

01:18:33 YOU WILL HEAR FROM HIM APRIL 12. THAT IS WHEN EARNINGS SEASON

01:18:37 STARTS TO KICK OFF AND CAN WE JUST REFLECT ON WHAT WE HEARD

01:18:40 FROM --? THE POINT ON M&A I THINK WE

01:18:45 HAVE TO KEEP REVISITING, THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THEY ARE

01:18:49 STRUGGLING TO CONVINCE THE BANKING UNIVERSE, STRUGGLING TO

01:18:52 GET VINCE CLIENTS TO ENTER INTO CONVERSATIONS ABOUT DEALS

01:18:54 BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU AGREE TO A PRICE, AGREE TO THE TERMS, YOU

01:18:57 COULD BE LEFT HANGING OUT TO DRIVE TO THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND

01:18:59 WASHINGTON, D.C. THROWING MUD AT YOU.

01:19:02 DO YOU WANT TO GO THROUGH THAT AS A LARGE COMPANY? LISA:

01:19:06 WHAT DOES A BANKING EXECUTIVE DO WITH THE BEHEMOTH THAT IS

01:19:08 WASHINGTON, D.C.? DO YOU KEEP GOING DOWN IN

01:19:12 LOBBYING? BECAUSE YOU CAN'T FIGHT AGAINST

01:19:16 THAT IF DEALS MIGHT NOT BE APPROVED.

01:19:19 WELL, HOW DO YOU ARGUE TO YOUR CLIENTS THIS IS A GOOD DEAL TO

01:19:22 TRANSACT IN BECAUSE YOU MAY HAVE SOME LEGAL FEES, BUT THIS

01:19:24 IS NOT A GOOD CASE FOR THEM TO BE MAKING. JONATHAN:

01:19:29 YOU CAN MAKE A GREAT CASE AND THEN YOU ARE DISSUADING FOR A

01:19:30 TWEET FROM SENATOR WARREN AND OTHERS TO SORT OF PYLON.

01:19:33 SHE'S GOT COMPANY IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY NOW. LISA:

01:19:36 THE KEY QUESTION FOR ME IS HOW MUCH WILL THERE BE SOME SORT OF

01:19:40 SURGE IN M&A POST-ELECTION?

01:19:47 FOUR NOT, IF AT MEL'S IS RIGHT AND THE POLICIES IN EITHER

01:19:48 CAN'T SEEM TO BE MORE OR LESS SIMILAR TO ONE ANOTHER.

01:19:51 JONATHAN: LET'S STICK WITH POLICY DOWN IN

01:19:52 WASHINGTON. SHARES OF INTEL RISING AFTER

01:19:57 THE COMPANY WINS ALMOST $20 BILLION IN INCENTIVES TO EXPAND

01:19:58 ITS SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORIES. THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT LOOKS

01:20:03 TO REINVIGORATE AMERICA'S DOMESTIC CHIP INDUSTRY AND

01:20:05 REVERSE A PRODUCTION SHIFT TOWARD ASIA, THE INVESTMENT IN

01:20:09 INTEL IS A KEY PART OF THE PLAN TO HAVE THE U.S.

01:20:10 PRODUCE 1/5 OF THE WORLD ABEYANCE LOGIC CHIPS BY THE END

01:20:13 OF THE DECADE. MICHAEL SHEPARD JOINS US NOW

01:20:15 FOR MORE ON THE STORY. THE MONEY WE ARE FINALLY

01:20:20 STARTING TO LEARN HOW BIG THESE NUMBERS ARE GOING TO BE AND WHO

01:20:22 IS GOING TO RECEIVE THEM. HOW BIG IS THIS GOING TO BE?

01:20:28 >> THIS PARTICULAR WAR THAT WE ARE SEEING TODAY IS SIGNIFICANT.

01:20:32 IT IS THE FIRST TO GO OUT FOR ADVANCED CHIPMAKING.

01:20:35 THEY ALREADY DOLED OUT A FEW PACKAGES FOR OLDER GENERATION

01:20:39 SEMICONDUCTORS, BUT THIS WOULD GO TO THE GOOD STUFF.

01:20:42 THIS WOULD GO TO WHAT THE U.S. IS REALLY TRYING TO REGAIN AND

01:20:46 MAINTAIN AN EDGE ON, AND THAT IS THE MOST SOPHISTICATED SHIPS

01:20:49 THAT ARE OUT THERE. THE MONEY WILL GO TO BOTH

01:20:51 PRODUCTION BUT ALSO TO SOME RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.

01:20:56 IT IS CONCENTRATED IN ARIZONA AND PRESIDENT BIDEN IS GOING TO

01:20:57 BE OUT THERE LATER TODAY TO MAKE THE ANNOUNCEMENT IN

01:21:01 ROUGHLY THE 1:00 FOR 2:00 P.M. OUR OUR TIME. LISA:

01:21:06 I DO HAVE TO ASK WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT, THE IDEA THAT

01:21:09 SOME OF THE DEFENSE SPENDING IN THE UNITED STATES IS BEING

01:21:11 SHIFTED TO TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS, BECAUSE THIS IS

01:21:14 THE NEW FRONT FOR THE COLD WAR INTERNATIONALLY.

01:21:19 HOW MUCH IS THAT HAPPENING, HOW MUCH OF THE DEFENSE BUDGET, AND

01:21:21 WHERE IS IT GOING WITH THE TECH WORLD?

01:21:25 >> THIS IS A GREAT QUESTION BECAUSE OUR REPORTERS HAVE BEEN

01:21:28 TRACKING THAT OVER THE YEARS AND HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN

01:21:31 INVESTMENT IN TECHNOLOGY. NOT ONLY IN THE TECHNOLOGY THAT

01:21:38 MAKES THE PENTAGON GO FROM DAY TO DAY, BUT REALLY THE

01:21:41 TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL POWER WEAPONS SYSTEMS AND THINGS LIKE

01:21:44 THAT, POWER HOW TROOPS ARE USED DATA DEPLOYED AND SOME OF THE

01:21:47 THINKING. WE HAD A TERRIFIC PIECE MAYBE A

01:21:53 WEEK OR TWO AGO BY TERESA MANSON WHO LOOKED AT THE USE OF

01:21:56 AI IN WARFARE AND HOW WE ARE EVEN SEEING IT DEPLOYED ON THE

01:21:58 BATTLEFIELD TODAY IN RELATION. JONATHAN:

01:22:00 CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE CHIPS ACT? CAN YOU TELL ME THE TERMS THAT

01:22:04 YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW TO RECEIVE THIS MONEY?

01:22:07 CLEARLY THAT IS NOT FREE. WHAT DO THEY HAVE TO DO TO

01:22:10 ATTRACT THAT KIND OF CAPITAL?

01:22:13 >> THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION. BASICALLY WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING

01:22:18 FOR IS THE COMPANIES HAVE TO SHOW WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO

01:22:23 WITH IT. THEY ARE QUIET IN TERMS OF WHAT

01:22:27 THEY'RE SAYING PUBLICLY, HOW THE MONEY WILL BE DEPLOYED IN

01:22:29 EACH INDIVIDUAL PROJECT AND EACH INDIVIDUAL PHASE, AND FOR

01:22:33 NOW THEY ARE AT LEAST GIVING ON A PER LUMINARY BASIS ACCESS TO

01:22:37 MUCH LARGER POTS AND THEN WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT ON

01:22:41 AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, HOW WILL THEY USE THE FACILITIES THEY

01:22:45 ARE DEVELOPING? REMEMBER, INTEL IS LOOKING FOR

01:22:48 THIS BIG FOOTPRINT IN ARIZONA. PART OF IT WILL BE WHAT IT WILL

01:22:53 LOOK LIKE IN TERMS OF CREATION OF JOBS AND BEING ABLE TO

01:22:57 SUSTAIN THOSE JOBS. THE OTHER PART WILL BE ON THE

01:23:00 TECHNOLOGY SIDE, HOW GOOD WILL ATTACK ACTUALLY BE AND WHAT

01:23:05 SORT OF A LEAP IN GENERATION WILL BEGIN TO SEE? JONATHAN:

01:23:09 THIS IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING MAYBE A DECADE

01:23:11 AGO WHEN CHINA WAS TALKING ABOUT MADE IN CHINA 2025.

01:23:15 HOW MANY YEARS TO WE HAVE TO WAIT?

01:23:20 >> WE ARE SEEING THE COMPANIES ALREADY STARTING TO BREAK

01:23:22 GROUND AND MAKE MOVES.

01:23:28 ARIZONA IS ONE PLACE THEY ARE INVESTING, OHIO IS ANOTHER.

01:23:31 BUT IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO ACTUALLY BEAR FRUIT ON THESE

01:23:34 INVESTMENTS. IT TAKES AN ENORMOUS EVENT OF

01:23:35 CAPITAL AND A LOT OF TIME TO BUILD ONE OF THESE FACTORIES

01:23:40 AND ACTUALLY GET IT UP AND RUNNING.

01:23:43 IT REQUIRES A LOT OF PEOPLE. AND TAIWAN IN PARTICULAR IS ONE

01:23:48 PLACE WHERE THEY HAD HAD THIS MISSION TO BUILD UP THEIR

01:23:52 SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING BASE AND TAIWAN SEMICONDUCTOR

01:23:55 MANUFACTURING COMPANY IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S LEADERS JUST

01:23:58 BECAUSE THEY HAVE MADE THIS CONCERTED AND DECADES-LONG

01:23:59 INVESTMENT IN THIS AREA. LISA: BUT TO THAT POINT, HOW MUCH IS

01:24:04 THIS TRYING TO REPLACE TAIWAN AS THE CENTER OF CHIP

01:24:05 PRODUCTION?

01:24:07 >> IT'S A GOOD QUESTION. WHEN WE SPEAK TO TAIWANESE

01:24:13 OFFICIALS AROUND TOWN AND ELSEWHERE, THEY DO BRISTLE AT

01:24:15 THE IDEA THAT THE U.S. MIGHT BE TRYING TO ELBOW THEM

01:24:18 OUT. FROM THE U.S. STANDPOINT, IT IS A LITTLE BIT

01:24:20 LESS THAN THAT AND A LITTLE BIT MORE OF ALTERING WHAT WE HAVE

01:24:24 TALKED ABOUT -- BOLSTERING WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT IN THIS

01:24:26 VENUE, THAT ECONOMIC SECURITY.

01:24:32 THEY WANT -- DON'T WANT TO SEE ALL OF OUR SEMICONDUCTOR

01:24:34 CAPABILITIES IN MANUFACTURING HOUSED OFFSHORE.

01:24:40 THEY ARE CONCERNED THAT HEAVEN FORBID, IF CHINA MAKES GOOD ON

01:24:45 SOME SORT OF PLAN TO MOVE ON TAIWAN MILITARILY, WHAT WOULD

01:24:49 HAPPEN TO THE U.S. ACCESS TO CHIPS, NEVER MIND ALL

01:24:52 THE OTHER FALLOUT FROM A MILITARY CONFLICT.

01:24:54 SO THERE IS THAT. AND THEN THERE WAS ALSO JUST

01:24:57 THE QUESTION OF THE U.S. HAS LONG BEEN A PIONEERING

01:25:01 CHAMPION IN THIS AREA FOR DECADES WITH THE MILITARY AND

01:25:04 SPACE PROGRAMS IN THE 60'S AND 70'S.

01:25:11 ONE OF THE PILLARS OF HIS FIVE NYMEX PROGRAM, -- BIDENOMNICS

01:25:14 PROGRAM, THEY HAVE REALLY BEEN PUSHING TO BRING SOME OF THAT

01:25:18 BACK HERE. LISA:LISA: I JUST HAVE TO WONDER ABOUT THE

01:25:21 ANALOG HISTORY WRITING. HOW MUCH IS THIS A REDUX OF

01:25:26 OPPENHEIMER AND THE WHOLE MANHATTAN PROJECT AND PUTTING

01:25:27 TONS OF MONEY INTO IT TO SEE WHAT THEY CAN COME OUT?

01:25:33 IS THIS BASICALLY A SIMILAR OTHER TECHNOLOGICALLY-FOCUSED

01:25:36 KIND OF TRANSITION WHERE THEY ARE TRYING TO FUNNEL AS MUCH

01:25:39 MONEY INTO THAT TO BEAT IN THE CYBER RACE WITH SOME OF THE

01:25:40 OTHER BIG POWERS?

01:25:45 >> THERE IS AN ANALOGY TO THE IDEA OF THE INITIATIVE.

01:25:49 THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO BE MUCH MORE TARGETED

01:25:53 AND FOCUSED AND THEY ARE REALLY TRYING TO BRING IN A RANGE OF

01:25:56 PEOPLE TO THE CONGRESS DEPARTMENT AND OTHER AGENCIES

01:25:57 TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS OVERSEEN PROPERLY WITH THE

01:26:00 FINANCIAL SIDE AND ALSO ON THE TECHNOLOGICAL SIDE.

01:26:07 ONE OF THE OTHER DIFFERENCES I THINK WE ALSO SEE IS THAT THE

01:26:10 MONEY ACTUALLY HAS A LIMIT. THERE'S $39 BILLION IN GRANTS

01:26:16 AND ANOTHER $79 BILLION IN LOANS AND OTHER GUARANTEES FOR

01:26:20 THIS PROGRAM, AND IF YOU TALK TO THE INTEL CEO WHO IS

01:26:25 SPEARHEADING THIS VAGUE EFFORT TO REVITALIZE THE COMPANY AND

01:26:28 MOVE IT FORWARD, HE SAYS THE U.S.

01:26:30 WILL VERY LIKELY NEED A CHIPS ACT TOO.

01:26:35 THIS INVESTMENT IS REALLY A DROP IN THE BUCKET COMPARED TO

01:26:40 ANOTHER HUNDRED HAVE DONE WITH THEIR MANUFACTURING BASES.

01:26:45 PLACES LIKE TAIWAN, JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA THAT HAVE THE

01:26:48 TRADITION OF INDUSTRIAL POLICY AND INVESTMENT. JONATHAN:

01:26:51 I'M SHOCKED THAT HE THINGS THEY SHOULD BE ANOTHER ACT,

01:26:55 ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED. I DON'T THINK PAT HAS EVER

01:26:58 SOUNDED PESSIMISTIC ABOUT ANYTHING EVER.

01:27:02 REMEMBER CATCHING UP WITH HIM A FEW WEEKS AGO? LISA:

01:27:06 I'M JUST WAITING FOR HIS SCARF TO ACTUALLY BE A QR CODE.

01:27:10 HE IS SO OPTIMISTIC AND I UNDERSTAND WHY.

01:27:14 OF COURSE HE'S GOING TO SAY WE NEED MORE, AND CAN MAKE THE

01:27:16 ARGUMENT, OF COURSE IS GOING TO SAY THAT.

01:27:18 THIS IS MY SHOCKED FACE. JONATHAN:

01:27:23 INTEL RECEIVING A .5 BILLION DOLLARS IN GRANTS, AS MUCH AS

01:27:26 $11 BILLION IN LOANS TO HELP FUND THE EXPANSION OF A

01:27:27 SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY. THOSE FEDERAL FUNDS EXPECTED TO

01:27:31 BEGIN FLOWING BY THE END OF 2024.

01:27:34 THAT STOCK IS HIGHER BY CLOSE TO 4% IN THE PREMARKET THROUGH

01:27:35 THIS MORNING. HERE IS YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF.

01:27:43 >> PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN AND FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP

01:27:48 SWEPT UP MORE DELEGATES YESTERDAY AS THEY SET THEIR

01:27:50 SIGHTS ON A REMATCH IN NOVEMBER. TRUMP WINNING ALL FIVE OF

01:27:56 PUBLICAN PRIMARIES WITH 75-81% SUPPORT, BIDEN WOODY FOUR

01:27:58 DEMOCRATIC PRIMARIES AFTER FLORIDA CANCELED ITS VOTE.

01:28:01 HE RECEIVED 83-91% OF THE VOTE. KANSAS WAS THE ONLY STATE WITH

01:28:05 A NONE OF THE ABOVE OPTION ON THE DEMOCRATIC ALEC IT IS UP

01:28:08 10%. THE TEXAS MIGRANT ARREST LAW IS

01:28:12 BACK ON HOLD. JUST HOURS AFTER THE LAW

01:28:16 BRIEFLY TOOK EFFECT, A FEDERAL APPEALS COURT STEPPED IN,

01:28:19 VENTING TEXAS FROM ARRESTING IT DEPORTING MIGRANTS ACCUSED OF

01:28:21 ENTERING THE U.S. ILLEGALLY. A THREE-JUDGE PANEL INTERVENED

01:28:27 AFTER A SERIES OF ACT AND FORTH RULINGS THAT SAW THE SUPREME

01:28:28 COURT WEIGHING IN. THAT THREE-JUDGE PANEL IS TODAY.

01:28:37 MICHAEL DELL IS UNLOADING SHARES OF HIS NAMESAKE COMPUTER

01:28:38 COMPANY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEARLY THREE YEARS.

01:28:42 DELL IS CASHING IN AS STOCKS SOAR ON OPTIMISM OVER AI.

01:28:47 FOR THE PAST TWO WEEKS THE FOUNDER AND CEO HAS BEEN

01:28:50 SELLING ON A NEAR DAILY BASIS, OFFLOADING ABOUT $465 MILLION

01:28:53 OF SHARES. HE STILL OWNS ABOUT HALF OF THE

01:28:56 TEXAS-BASED COMPANY. JONATHAN: THANK YOU.

01:29:02 UP NEXT, CRUDE OIL. THAT IS NEXT, THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

01:29:21 ♪ JONATHAN: EQUITIES ON THE S&P POSITED BY CLOSE TO 0.1% AND

01:29:23 COUNTING YOU DOWN TO THE OPENING BELL.

01:29:26 90 MINUTES AWAY, A COUPLE OF HOURS AWAY.

01:29:28 EQUITY FUTURES DOING OK. 66 ON THE U.S. 10 YEAR.

01:29:36 OVER THE LAST WEEK, UNDER SURVEILLANCE THIS MORNING,

01:29:38 CRUDE OIL BREAKING OUT.

01:29:44 >> THE CONSENSUS RANGE IS 70-90. DO YOU REALLY WANT TO BE SURE

01:29:46 TO DOLLARS $.50 FROM HERE? PROBABLY NOT.

01:29:51 I THINK WE ARE GOING TO SEE IT WELL OUTSIDE OF THAT RANGE.

01:29:55 I'M NOT SURE HOW HIGH WE GO, IT IS NOT MY JOB ANYMORE THESE

01:29:58 DAYS, BUT THE RISK IS CLEARLY THE UPSIDE AND THE MAIN POINT

01:30:01 IS I WANT TO BE LONG AND THE REST OF THE COMMODITY COMPLEX.

01:30:07 JONATHAN: IT'S FANTASTIC SEE JEFF CURRY

01:30:10 WITH A NEW SEAT. LISA:

01:30:12 WE HAVE TO GET HIM BACK IN AND TALKING ABOUT WHY SO MANY

01:30:14 PEOPLE ARE BULLISH BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT INVESTORS, THEY ARE

01:30:18 NOT MAKING CALLS ON EXACTLY WHERE THE OIL PRICES GOING TO

01:30:19 GO BUT THEY ARE MOSTLY ALL BULLISH. JONATHAN:

01:30:23 HE'S GOING TO OFFER A PRICE TARGET, SURELY. LISA:

01:30:27 HE WILL HAVE ONE, BUT IT IS NOT HIS JOB TO GET PILLORIED FOR

01:30:29 BEING WRONG. JONATHAN: I LOVE JEFF.

01:30:35 IF YOU ARE LISTENING, IT WILL BE GOOD TO CATCH UP SOON.

01:30:38 THE OUTLOOK FOR THE CRUDE MARKET.

01:30:41 WE NEED TO GET STRAIGHT TO THIS BREAKOUT WE ARE SEEING.

01:30:45 OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS, GETTING CLOSE TO 90 AGAIN.

01:30:48 WHAT IS BEHIND THIS BREAKOUT? WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WHY IT

01:30:53 HASN'T HAPPENED FOR MONTHS AND THEN JUST LIKE THAT, IT STARTS

01:30:57 TO HAPPEN.

01:30:58 >> FIRST OF ALL, WE HAVEN'T HAD INVENTORIES BUILDING IN Q1 SO

01:31:01 ALL THE MARKET BANNERS FIND THIS INVENTORIES THAT WERE

01:31:02 SUPPOSED TO COME. NUMBER TWO, AND THIS IS

01:31:05 SOMETHING HE TOUCHES ON, IT IS THE WHOLE COMPLEX BREAKING OUT

01:31:09 IN TERMS OF COMMODITIES. THE GOLDMAN SACHS COMMODITIES

01:31:12 INDEX, EVERYTHING IS MOVING UP. COPPER, NATURAL GAS.

01:31:22 AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT $90 RANGE, IF WE GET BECOME

01:31:25 BREAKING OUT HIGHER THEN YOU GET THOSE PASSIVE INVESTORS

01:31:27 BUYING OIL RIGHT NOW THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT SHORT RIGHT NOW.

01:31:30 THEY COULD BE LONG OIL BUT SHORT IN THE INDEX.

01:31:33 AS THIS COMMODITY AND THAT BECOMES MORE POPULAR, YOU GET

01:31:36 THAT PASSIVE MONEY IN WHICH THEN PROPELS THE FUNDAMENTALS

01:31:39 TO WHERE WE SEE THEM GOING. WHICH IS A MUCH TIGHTER MARKET

01:31:42 THIS TIME. JONATHAN: HE TALKED ABOUT COPPER.

01:31:46 COPPER CLOSE TO NINE K THIS MORNING.

01:31:49 I THINK WE BROKE THROUGH THAT LEVEL IN THE LAST WEEK OR SO.

01:31:55 ARE THOSE STORIES DIFFERENT, OR DO THEY POINT TO THE SAME THEME?

01:31:59 IS THAT ABOUT SUPPLY AND MAYBE NOT ABOUT DEMAND?

01:32:05 >> IT IS ESPECIALLY ABOUT SUPPLY, BUT WE HAVE BEEN

01:32:06 WAITING ON SELLING CAPITAL FOR A LONG TIME.

01:32:09 THE ENERGY TRANSITION STORY IS VERY IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF

01:32:13 COPPER DEMAND. IT HAS BEEN VIEWED QUITE

01:32:16 NEGATIVELY BECAUSE OF THE SITUATION IN CHINA, BUT WE NEED

01:32:19 TO THINK ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE BUILDOUT. NOT ONLY COMPLETELY --

01:32:24 COMPLETING A HOUSE AT THE LAST LEG OF THAT SIDE OF THINGS.

01:32:30 WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OIL SIDE, DEMAND CONTINUES TO BE STRONG.

01:32:41 YOU EXPECT TO SEE GROWTH IN OIL DEMAND, BUT THIS IS WHERE WE

01:32:43 EXPECT THINGS TO BE HIGHER YEAR-OVER-YEAR BECAUSE WE NEED

01:32:46 TO RESTOCK ON THAT SIDE, AND THAT REQUIRES MORE CRUDE TO RUN

01:32:47 MORE REFINERIES. LISA: HOW MUCH IS SOME OF THE

01:32:53 REPORTING OUT OF UKRAINE AND RUSSIA AFFECTING THE PRICE

01:32:56 MOVES GIVEN THE FACT THAT UKRAINE IS SUCCESSFULLY

01:32:58 TARGETING A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT RUSSIAN SITES INCLUDING

01:33:08 REFINERIES?

01:33:09 >> THIS IS A REAL GAME CHANGER AT THE MARKET STARTS TO

01:33:10 UNDERSTAND WE ARE ENTERING PERHAPS THE NEXT PHASE IN THE

01:33:12 WAR. UKRAINE IS USING UKRAINE- DESIGNED DRONES TO TARGET

01:33:14 SPECIFIC REFINERIES. HUNDREDS OF MILES WITHIN RUSSIA.

01:33:21 THAT MEANS THEY CAN TAKE OUT REFINERY UNITS AS THEY WISH.

01:33:25 ALREADY, WE HAVE THE IMPACT RIGHT NOW IN RUSSIA OF AROUND

01:33:29 850-900,000 BARRELS PER DAY OF REFINERY OUTAGES.

01:33:31 THAT INCLUDES REFINERY MAINTENANCE.

01:33:35 AROUND 500 TO 600 ARE BECAUSE OF WHAT HAS BEEN HIT.

01:33:39 WHEN YOU TAKE THAT OUT OF THE REFINERY COMPLEX GLOBALLY, WHEN

01:33:43 RUSSIA IS ALREADY LIMITING EXPORTS OF REFINED PRODUCTS,

01:33:47 YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT WHERE IS THE REFINING CAPACITY IN THE

01:33:54 WORLD? AND THAT IS IN CHINA.

01:33:57 IN Q2, CHINA ONLY HAS 300,000 BARRELS PER DAY OF SPARE

01:33:59 CAPACITY BECAUSE OF MAINTENANCE, SO THAT MEANS AND

01:34:01 EVERYONE COMES BACK FROM MAINTENANCE IN JUNE AND JULY,

01:34:04 THEY ARE GOING TO RAMP REALLY HARD IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY NEED

01:34:08 TO RUN. AND THIS IS WHERE WE THINK OPEC

01:34:11 WILL HAVE TO CHANGE THEIR STRATEGY BECAUSE ALL OF THAT

01:34:12 HAS TO HAPPEN AT ONCE. OTHERWISE WE HAVE NO GASOLINE

01:34:14 FOR THE SUMMER. LISA: WE SEEM GASOLINE PRICES ALREADY

01:34:20 HIGHER IN THE UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW, ABOUT $3.51, THE

01:34:22 HIGHEST GOING THAT MONTHS. LOOKING RIGHT NOW I THE HIGHEST

01:34:28 SINCE OCTOBER 2023, HOW HIGH COULD IT GO GIVEN THE BLOCKADE

01:34:30 IN THE REFINERY PROCESS GLOBALLY?

01:34:35 >> WELL, I MEAN, WE ARE TRADERS, RIGHT?

01:34:42 THERE IS NO PEAK NUMBER, IT IS THAT DEMAND-DESTRUCTIVE NUMBER.

01:34:46 BUT IT DEPENDS WHAT THE U.S. DECIDES TO DO ABOUT THE

01:34:47 SITUATION, RIGHT? WORST-CASE SCENARIO THAT WE

01:34:50 HAVE RUSSIAN REFINERIES CONTINUED TO GET STRUCK THROUGH

01:34:56 Q2, ONES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN STRUCK CAN'T COME BACK ONLINE,

01:35:00 WE DIDN'T HAVE A SITUATION WHERE RUSSIA IS IMPORTING

01:35:03 GASOLINE OR TRYING TO IMPORT GASOLINE, WHAT CAN NATO DO?

01:35:05 THEY CAN JUST BLOCKADE THAT. THAT IS WHERE WE CAN HAVE A

01:35:10 LIMIT ON THAT GASOLINE PRICE INCREASE BECAUSE THEN RUSSIA IS

01:35:14 NOT TRYING TO TAKE IN PRODUCT THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR THE REST

01:35:16 OF THE WORLD EVEN IF NATO WERE TO DO THAT, WE STILL SEE UPSIDE

01:35:21 TO GASOLINE PRICES FROM WHERE WE ARE NOW, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE

01:35:24 THE U.S. ECONOMY IS LOOKING QUITE ALL

01:35:26 RIGHT. JONATHAN: CAN WE WRAP THINGS UP WITH WHAT

01:35:28 YOU SAID ABOUT OPEC? YOU SAID OPEC WILL HAVE TO DO

01:35:32 SOMETHING, WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT?

01:35:35 >> IT IS NOT ONLY THEY CAN BRING BACK BARRELS IN Q3, THEY

01:35:38 WILL BE COMPELLED TO BRING BACK BARRELS IN Q3 TO PREVENT THE

01:35:45 MARKET FROM HITTING A DEMAND-DESTRUCTIVE NUMBER IN

01:35:49 TERMS OF REFINED PRODUCT.

01:35:51 WE EXPECT IN JUNE FOR REFINERIES TO RAMP UP AND THAT

01:35:53 WILL PROBABLY PROMOTE A LITTLE BIT OF CHEATING WITHIN THE

01:35:57 GROUPS SO COME THE MEETING THEY WILL DECIDE WITH THE MARKET AS

01:36:00 IT LOOKS NOW THAT THEY NEED TO BRING BACK AT LEAST 500,000

01:36:02 BARRELS PER DAY OF PRODUCTION, MAYBE UP TO ONE MILLION.

01:36:04 JONATHAN: YOU SAID Q3. THERE IS AN INTERESTING THING

01:36:08 HAPPENING IN Q4, THE U.S. ELECTION.

01:36:15 YOU REMEMBER THE MIDTERMS, NOT MY PHRASE, SOMEONE ELSE'S.

01:36:18 BUT THERE WAS BIG PRESSURE ON THE SAUDI'S TO INCREASE OUTPUT

01:36:22 BECAUSE IT WAS BELIEVED THAT THE PRESIDENT WANTED LOWER OIL

01:36:24 PRICES GOING INTO THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS.

01:36:27 I JUST WONDER IF IT IS IN THEIR OWN INTEREST POLITICALLY TO DO

01:36:31 WHAT YOU ARE SUGGESTING THEY WOULD NEED TO DO IN Q3.

01:36:35 HOW WILL THE POLITICS PLAINTIFF THAT DECISION?

01:36:38 >> THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WILL PUSH THIS AND THE CHINESE

01:36:39 WILL NEED IT AS WELL. IT IS BOTH SIDES OF THEIR

01:36:41 CONSUMER POOL. SO IT JUST MAKES SENSE.

01:36:44 LISA: HONESTLY TO ME THIS IS JUST

01:36:47 FASCINATING. I WONDER HOW MUCH THIS IS GOING

01:36:50 TO CAP PRICES. IS THIS A CAP TO HAVE HIGH

01:36:53 PRICES COULD GO?

01:36:57 >> IT IS A SOLUTION THAT DOESN'T SOLVE THE TIGHTNESS IS

01:37:00 IN THAT REFINERY SECTOR. BUT IT WILL HELP EASE THINGS.

01:37:06 WE CAN ACTUALLY GET THROUGH THE SUMMER. JONATHAN:

01:37:09 APPRECIATE YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THIS.

01:37:15 WHILE WE ARE SEEING COMMODITIES, WHAT IS BEHIND IT,

01:37:18 SUPPLY SIDE STORY AND PERHAPS WHY OPEC WILL NEED TO ACT IN Q3.

01:37:22 BUT THE POLITICS OF ACTING IN Q3 GOING INTO Q4 IS LESS

01:37:23 OBVIOUS. IT IS HARD TO READ THE TEA

01:37:27 LEAVES ON THIS ONE GOING INTO THE END OF THE YEAR. LISA:

01:37:30 YOU THINK OPEC-PLUS IS GOING TO WANT TO GET TO THE U.S.?

01:37:33 JONATHAN: WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SAUDI

01:37:35 ARABIA. ALL I CAN DO IS LEAN ON THE

01:37:38 EXPERIENCE OF WHAT WE SAW GOING INTO THE MIDTERMS AND THERE IS

01:37:41 SOME REAL TENSION BETWEEN THIS ADMINISTRATION AND THE SAUDI

01:37:42 ARABIA KINGDOM. I JUST WONDER IF THAT TENSION

01:37:46 IS GOING TO BE THERE IN QUITE THE SAME WAY IN A FEW TIME.

01:37:51 LISA: ESPECIALLY IF THEY SUPPORT ONE

01:37:53 CANDIDATE MORE THAN THE OTHER AND THEY WANT TO PUT THEIR

01:37:56 THUMB ON THE SCALE BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THE CLEANEST WAYS TO

01:37:58 DO SO CONSIDERING THAT WHEN OIL PRICES TEND TO BE HIGHER AND

01:38:01 GAS PRICES ARE HIGHER, PEOPLE TEND TO FEEL WORSE AND THAT

01:38:04 AFFECTS ELECTIONS. JONATHAN: IT WILL HE PART OF THE

01:38:06 CALCULATION CONVERSATION, LET'S PUT IT THAT WAY.

01:38:11 CHINA NEEDS IT, TOO, AND MAYBE THAT IS THE THING THAT TIPS THE

01:38:12 SCALE IF IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. CRUDE IS A DIFFICULT THING TO

01:38:17 FORECAST. IF YOU WANT TO MAKE A FULL OF SOMEONE, ASK THEM WHERE

01:38:21 THEY THINK CRUDE IS GOING TO BE IN THREE MONTHS TIME AND THEY

01:38:22 WILL PROBABLY LOOK A FULL. LISA: THE U.S.'S SWING FACTOR IS

01:38:29 SHIFTING AND THE STORY IS SHIFTING BEYOND THAT AND I

01:38:30 THINK THAT IS SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT. JONATHAN:

01:38:33 UP NEXT WE WILL CATCH UP WITH STEVE MAJOR OF HSBC, JON OF

01:38:39 GOLDMAN SACHS AND DAVID OF UBS.

01:38:54 ♪

01:38:58 >> THE FED HAS LATITUDE THAT A LOT OF PLACES DON'T HAVE.

01:39:05 >> IF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS ARE EASIER, THERE IS LESS EASING

01:39:06 FOR THE FED TO DO.

01:39:07 >> WE WANT TO CUT RATES. THE PROBLEM IS THE DATA IS NOT

01:39:10 LETTING US.

01:39:11 >> THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AT EASE

01:39:15 RATHER DRAMATICALLY. I THINK THEY SHOULD AS A MATTER

01:39:19 OF LONG-TERM STRATEGIC POLICY MOVE BACK TO NEUTRAL RATES

01:39:20 BECAUSE THE ECONOMY DOESN'T NEED THEM TO BE TIGHT.

01:39:24 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE WITH JONATHAN

01:39:27 FERRO, LISA ABRAMOWICZ AND ANNMARIE HORDERN. JONATHAN:

01:39:30 THE THIRD HOUR OF BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE BEGINS RIGHT NOW.

01:39:34 LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY THIS MORNING, GOOD MORNING, GOOD

01:39:38 MORNING. IT IS FED DECISION TODAY AND

01:39:41 GOING INTO THAT DECISION THIS AFTERNOON, EQUITIES, ALL-TIME

01:39:42 HIGHS ADDING SOME WEIGHT TO IT THIS MORNING.

01:39:46 CREDIT SPREADS VERY TIGHT AND TRYING TO WORK OUT WHAT

01:39:48 CHAIRMAN POWELL IS GOING TO SAY IN HIS NEWS CONFERENCE. LISA:

01:39:52 HONESTLY WHAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR IS SOME PERSPECTIVE

01:39:54 MARKET ACTIVITY AS WELL AS MAYBE SOME WALKING BACK OF THIS

01:39:57 DESIRE TO CUT RATES BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IN THE MARKET THERE

01:40:02 IS THIS BELIEF THAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE WANTS TO CUT RATES

01:40:03 REGARDLESS OF DATA. JONATHAN: HE SPOKE A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO

01:40:08 DOWN ON CAPITOL HILL IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE AND THEN THE

01:40:11 SENATE, BASICALLY SAID WE ONLY NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:40:14 CONFIDENCE, SO WHAT HAS CHANGED TO MARK LISA:

01:40:16 THERE HASN'T EVEN BEEN A LITTLE BIT MORE CONFIDENT THAT SOME

01:40:20 PEOPLE ARE NOW SAYING IF YOU LOOK AT THE EURO PER YOUR

01:40:24 COMPS, IS GOING TO GET COMPLICATED TO GET DOWN TO THE

01:40:25 LEVEL THAT THEY WANT TO SEE BY SUMMER.

01:40:28 THAT SAID, HOW MUCH ARE THEY CONCERNED ABOUT THE RISK OF A

01:40:31 DOWNTURN HAPPENING VERY LATE AND ALL AT ONCE?

01:40:37 THAT TO ME IS GOING TO BE A KEY QUESTION, DO THEY STILL SEE

01:40:38 THAT AS A BIGGER RISK THAN RUNAWAY INFLATION? JONATHAN:

01:40:40 HE BASICALLY SAID THAT STRONG GROWTH ISN'T A PROBLEM AND WE

01:40:43 CAN RESPOND TO WEEK GROWTH. I WONDER IF THAT STORY HAS

01:40:46 CHANGED. PLUS WE HAVE TO DISCUSS HOW

01:40:49 RELEVANT THIS IS TO EQUITY MARKETS GIVEN HOW MANY CUTS WE

01:40:53 REST OUT IN 2024 AND THE FACT WE ARE SITTING HERE IN MARCH.

01:40:57 AND HERE WE ARE WITH STOCKS AT ALL-TIME HIGHS AND THAT IS NOT

01:41:02 THE CONVERSATION AT ALL. STOCKS ARE DOING OK.

01:41:05 LISA: IF YOUR HEAD IS SPINNING COME

01:41:07 UP WITH THE CLUB. I WONDER IF STOCK CAN KEEP

01:41:10 RALLYING BECAUSE OF THE NAMED THEIR NOT VULNERABLE TO

01:41:13 INTEREST RATES. A TEXT, THEY HAVE HUGE CASH

01:41:15 FLOWS AND THEY DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE MUCH DEBT.

01:41:19 DO YOU SEE THE BIFURCATION CONTINUE, THE BROADENING OUT

01:41:23 THAT EVERYONE HAS BEEN LOOKING FOR SIMPLE BECAUSE THOSE TEND

01:41:28 TO BE THOSE OTHER 492 NAMES, THE ONES THAT ARE MORE

01:41:29 LEVERAGED SOME OF THESE RATES? THIS IS SORT OF THE DYNAMIC

01:41:34 THAT EVERYONE WANTS TO DIE AND ISN'T GOING AWAY. JONATHAN:

01:41:39 WE SHOULD STOP TALKING SO MUCH BECAUSE WE'VE GOT A FANTASTIC

01:41:40 LINE OF THIS HOUR. COMING UP THIS HOUR, WE WILL

01:41:45 CATCH UP WITH HSBC STEPHEN MAJOR ON HIS BULLISH TREASURY

01:41:50 CALL. WHETHER HE THINKS INFLATION

01:41:52 WILL FALL IN TIME FOR A JUNE RATE CUT.

01:41:59 ALL EYES ON THE FEDERAL RESERVE DECISION COMING AT 2:00 P.M.

01:42:00 EASTERN TIME. BOND YIELDS RISING AS DATA

01:42:03 COMES IN HOTTER THAN EXPECTED. STEPHEN MAJOR OF HSBC STAYING

01:42:06 BULLISH. IN ANTICIPATION OF RATE CUTS WE

01:42:12 TAKE BULLISH DURATION EXPOSURE IN EUROPE AND STAY AT MILDLY

01:42:14 BULLISH FOR TREASURIES.

01:42:22 CAN WE START WITH THAT MILDLY BULLISH STORY FOR TREASURIES,

01:42:24 WHY MILDLY BULLISH IN THE ACE OF A BIT OF A SELLOFF WE'VE

01:42:25 SEEN SO FAR?

01:42:27 >> MILDLY BULLISH IS NOT ALL IN. ALL IN IS FULL ON BULLISH AND

01:42:32 THAT IS WHY EUROPE IS RANKED ABOVE THE U.S.

01:42:35 IN TERMS OF POSSIBLE EASING AND PERFORMANCE FROM DURATION.

01:42:40 BUT WE CAN'T LET GO OF THIS VIEW THAT YIELDS ARE GOING TO

01:42:43 BE LOWER, NOT HIGHER BY YEAR END, AND I GET THEY'VE BEEN

01:42:47 SLIDING UP THE LAST WEEK OR SO, BUT THE CONTEXT IS IMPORTANT.

01:42:50 WE'VE COME A LONG WAY FROM THE PEAK OF YIELDS IN OCTOBER.

01:42:56 INFLATION PEAKED IN JUNE OF 2022. THE MARKET CHANGED ITS

01:43:01 DIRECTIONAL VIEW IN OCTOBER 2022.

01:43:02 THE FED PIVOTED A COUPLE MONTHS LATER.

01:43:06 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO CHANGE THEIR MIND.

01:43:09 THE NEXT MOVE IS DOWN AND IN THE MEANTIME WE KNOW IT IS

01:43:11 EITHER UNCHANGED OR DOWN FOR POLICY RATES, AND THEREFORE THE

01:43:15 TRADE IS SIT IN THE BELLY OF THE CURVE.

01:43:18 IF NOT TREASURIES, YOU TAKE CREDIT.

01:43:27 IF YOU CAN'T TAKE THOSE, T-BILLS AND CHILL.

01:43:30 -HERE LONG ENOUGH NOW. JONATHAN: LET'S GO OUT TO THE 10-YEAR.

01:43:36 WHAT BACKS UP THIS CALL AT THE MOMENT THAT YIELDS WILL BE

01:43:38 LOWER, NOT HIGHER?

01:43:43 >> IF YOU TALK TO THE MOST HAWKISH INDIVIDUAL IN THE

01:43:44 DECEMBER DOT PLOT YOU GET A LONGER RUN EQUITY REAL RAT
