00:02 Give warning from London. This is Bloomberg Markets today I'm Anna

00:05 Edwards alongside Guy Johnson and crazy upset with the cash.

00:07 Today just less than an hour away. Here's what you need to know.

00:10 The yen hits a fresh 34 year low, breaching 156 after the BOJ holds rates

00:16 steady and tweaks his language on bond buying.

00:18 We'll bring you the latest reaction. And governor, you ladies press

00:22 conference which starts later this hour. Soft landing hopes dampened as the US

00:26 economy slows and price pressures move higher.

00:29 Trade is pair rate cup bets as the focus shifts to PC data due out today.

00:34 Plus, stocks in Asia follow Wall Street higher after buoyant results from

00:38 Alphabet and from Microsoft. We'll bring you the latest earnings from

00:41 Europe with NatWest and Totalenergies reporting.

00:44 In the meantime, more on the markets. You're seeing that green on the screen

00:47 continue into the European session, at least early on.

00:49 Your stocks, 50 futures higher by 9/10 of 1%, pushing 100 higher by about the

00:53 same margin. The two year yield, though, hit that 5%

00:56 level now at about 499. We're going to dive into the

00:58 implications of the data. And of course, on that currency watch is

01:01 Asad 156 handle on dollar yen. Marcus today starts right now.

01:19 Good morning. Where are we?

01:20 Friday the 26th. Friday the 26th.

01:23 We have finally made it. Bunch of things happening right now.

01:26 We will come on to and do with more detail in just a moment.

01:28 First of all, it looks like NatWest has beaten with its numbers this morning.

01:33 We've also got news out from Anglo American saying that the proposal that

01:37 we've had for BHP undervalues its future prospects and talking of future

01:41 prospects. Right on cue, copper hitting 10,000.

01:45 So that maybe reinforcing its argument that maybe it should be worth a little

01:49 bit more money. The story, though, this morning largely

01:51 centering around what is happening with the macro picture.

01:53 We saw the US data yesterday. We get more of that a little bit later

01:57 on. That is going to inform us as to how the

01:59 Fed is likely to react to next week's meeting.

02:02 But the immediate story, guys, is the DOJ that felt quite dovish.

02:06 Hmm. Yeah, I mean, and certainly the

02:08 currency's continued to drop, hasn't it? And a lot of we've been asking all this

02:12 week whether could we maybe get it any kind of surprise.

02:14 We didn't get a surprise, certainly not in the shape of a rate hike.

02:17 And that had been only an outside sort of tail risk.

02:20 But there have been some people asking whether we get that.

02:22 I suppose with the economy expected to have been in contraction at the start of

02:26 this year, we shouldn't be overly surprised about that, but yet that the

02:30 yen continues to drop as a result. It continues to drop.

02:32 And I think we're talking a lot about monetary policy.

02:34 The fiscal policy of Japan matters as well as lot.

02:36 There are subsidies at play. There are kind of additional wage

02:39 negotiations at play as well. So the concept of that perhaps another

02:42 hike may materialize, be addressed by the end of the year is not an outside

02:46 possibility. Two months ago we might have that it

02:48 was, yeah, an intervention of course the key focus of the day.

02:51 But then that rubs up against us. Data and timing of any of that will be

02:54 really interesting to watch. Press conference kicks off in.

02:56 Where are we? It's 3 minutes into the show, so we've

02:59 got 27 minutes to go until the press conference starts.

03:02 Is he going to be more hawkish, wider? I think it's going to be really

03:05 interesting. It feels dovish at this point.

03:07 But as we've learned from Jay Powell, things can change during press

03:10 conferences and maybe we can see pivots that ultimately change the market's

03:15 direction. So we'll see.

03:16 He could be hawkish. He could be saving that narrative up.

03:19 I we're watching very carefully what is happening.

03:21 We are aware of the risks in terms of the imported inflation narrative around

03:24 a weaker currency. There are various tweaks and changes

03:27 that he can make. Do we work this into the I mean, I

03:30 mentioned the US taxes piece. Yeah, later.

03:32 And a lot of people, every time we get a US state to print and we're watching

03:34 intervention, there's a lot of conversation about, well, if they're

03:37 going to intervene, when do they do they do it after the date it and they do it.

03:41 You know what? What do they tell me the guys.

03:43 And that takes us on to the US data of yesterday, which for some people was the

03:47 worst of both worlds really the stagflation conversation perhaps back as

03:50 in we're talking about a week ago story at the United States, which makes a

03:53 change because we certainly have not been doing that over recent months.

03:56 The day the music died was the way that Bill GROSS summed it up.

03:59 I have issues with the weakness. I think there is.

04:03 You look at the top line number. Yeah, you can see that it's weakness.

04:06 I'll tell you, there's a bunch of factors you need to consider here.

04:09 Import data is surging. So you weirdly and I know this feels

04:13 kind of counterintuitive, but you back that out of the GDP number.

04:16 So if you've got strong imports, i.e. the economy's doing well and you've got

04:19 strong imports because the economy hasn't got the potential to satisfy all

04:22 the demand, you back that up, GDP inventories, you back out of GDP,

04:26 they're coming down again, a signal of strength.

04:29 Well, it's not just guy who's not too worried about the weakness of the GDP.

04:31 Janet Yellen also not too worried about this in good company.

04:34 Yeah, same team you are. She called them peculiar elements and

04:38 you've described them guy that peculiar elements and therefore she's not worried

04:41 that that does sound like Guy Johnson wording I sure did write that for her

04:44 guy I'm moonlighting as a speechwriter. I wouldn't be surprised.

04:48 I think what's also important to keep in mind is as we're talking about this

04:51 consumer weakness and the import export story is China is a key piece of this.

04:54 And I think this folds in so well and so beautifully with the Japanese yen story,

04:58 even the copper story as well, because as you're seeing weakness in the United

05:02 States, how much of that is a China deflationary story as well, that it's

05:06 kind of starting to seep into some of the data?

05:08 A couple of months ago, we start to see economists warning about that

05:11 deflationary read through. If you look at the export data, you're

05:13 already seeing that in like the ports of L.A., for example, you're already seeing

05:17 that read through. That could be adding to some of the

05:19 weakness. The other piece of it is the currency

05:21 story. This idea here that you're starting to

05:23 see these dollar longs position that is adding to the yen weakness that also

05:27 adds on again to competition in the APAC region in terms of exports again to the

05:31 United States. So there's kind of this trade in the EM

05:33 world that pips the Japanese yen, the yuan and the Korean one all against each

05:38 other, all in terms of how the US consumer is doing.

05:41 You get a solid print later. I so so yesterday I love the update

05:44 because it's sort of confusing. So you get core PC data that comes out

05:47 on GDP day because it's part of the GDP package.

05:50 And then you get the personal consumption income data package which

05:53 comes out the following day, which is also, funnily enough, called confusing

05:57 deflator. But it's today's one that the Fed

05:58 releases. It's the today's one that the Fed

06:00 watches. So yesterday's number definitely split

06:02 the market. So yesterday's inflation data was

06:04 strong. Today's the one you really want to

06:06 watch. The market feels like, though, it is

06:09 increasingly set up for a higher print and we've back yesterday quite a

06:15 significant repricing of the Fed so we've now.

06:17 I get the Fed to December, which I think is amazing.

06:19 So we're not actually far from kind of pricing 2025 now.

06:23 But if you get a weak print today, I think the kind of the asymmetry around

06:27 the reaction today is going to be thing. I think they're kind of the higher

06:30 inflation number feels like it's increasingly priced.

06:32 If you get a weaker print, maybe that's not priced.

06:34 So maybe that's where the volatility comes in a little bit later on.

06:37 The bond story's really interesting as well.

06:38 I'm sure it was terrible. The auction was really, really bad,

06:42 which is surprising. And giving that earlier in the week, the

06:45 auction was actually pretty decent, kind of buying out the yield.

06:48 But I think it kind of creates a line in the sand of the 5% level that you're

06:51 seeing on the two year yield. That seems to be the line in the sand

06:54 for a lot investors. We've been talking about that in terms

06:55 of the ripple effects of stock market globally.

06:58 Let's just get to some European earnings.

06:59 So it's just a you know, just to show we care.

07:02 We've got numbers that we definitely care.

07:04 We got numbers out of NatWest. No, I only read it like that because

07:07 actually they're maintaining their guidance.

07:08 And the numbers, though, do look to be a beat.

07:11 So pre-tax operating profit, better impairment loss coming in lower than

07:14 expected. What is really interesting, this whole

07:16 sector, we've had Lloyds, we had Barclays yesterday.

07:18 Venkat It's all about net interest margin and the way they're managing

07:21 that. There's a lot of talk in the sector

07:22 about structural hedges and the way that these banks are able to delay the impact

07:26 of some of the negatives whilst bringing forward the impact of the positive in

07:29 terms of rate changes. What we and we talked about the

07:32 volatility in the Gilt story with Ben yesterday, and that's been something

07:35 that's been really, of course on the minds of these businesses but

07:38 government's sake. So we don't have any more update there.

07:40 I guess that's not in the hands of the NatWest management, but you've got to

07:43 wonder the with the shareholding down to less than 30% already, are we going to

07:48 get some kind of big sale? They just keep drip feeding it into the

07:50 market this way. Still feels like a fairly chunky

07:52 overhang in terms of stock. The other thing I would flag as well in

07:55 NatWest is that the Q1 impairment loss was 93 million.

07:58 The estimate there was 174. So better, so much better if you see the

08:01 consumer confidence data out this morning ticking a little higher in the

08:04 UK as well, maybe suggesting that actually the UK economy maybe is

08:08 stabilizing, albeit at reasonably elevated rates.

08:12 We've also got numbers at the total end interest rates, not economic rates.

08:15 Right, right, right. We got numbers that it's total energies

08:18 adjusted net $5.11 billion. That is just ahead of the estimate of 5

08:23 billion. I was entirely distracted in my

08:25 preparation for this for this earnings story today by a note out from Harvey, a

08:28 blast. He's been keeping us focused on listings

08:32 of big energy businesses in Europe and whether they're tempted to go to the

08:35 U.S. And he says that he's talked before

08:38 about total. At this time, he's talking about total

08:41 sorry, he's talked before about Shell. Now he's talking about Total.

08:44 It's been listed in Paris since 1929. Could it go to the U.S.?

08:49 And he's suggesting that both of those could move it.

08:51 If you guys rant on oil, multiple it. No, no, no, no.

08:55 I'm going. It's about yogurt.

08:56 Oh, yeah. Naturally, they'll be pushed back.

08:58 Oh, then be push back. If Danone is strategic, what do you

09:01 think Total is? Yeah, absolutely.

09:03 I mean, they gas as gas and energy have proven to be very important strategic

09:07 assets. It would be unlikely the French

09:10 government would be particularly taking a taking a laissez faire attitude

09:13 towards the movements of large French energy stocks to the United States.

09:18 They're also planning a $2 billion buyback.

09:20 And that's exactly what I was going to say.

09:22 That's not the only company, by the way, is another story out of Alphabet as

09:25 well. But earnings in the tech story as well

09:28 out of the Olympics. I mean, go to nitty gritty.

09:29 But the first ever did a dividend coming out of Alphabet 20 $0.20 a share on top

09:35 of a $70 billion stock buyback, even if the numbers were poor, even if they

09:40 didn't have the market share in the cloud boom there, that would still be a

09:44 stock to buy just for returns. But they did, which is why you saw this

09:47 massive move in the stock. Yeah, we dance the Magnificent Three

09:50 now, is it is it alphabet? Are we losing them that quickly?

09:54 Well, it kind of if you think about what happened last night, it was Microsoft

09:57 Alphabet it videos and it is not had a great week.

10:00 Take a look at Nvidia this week it's it's not had a fantastic week but you

10:03 kind of feel but down to alphabet Microsoft and Nvidia it's a scrappy week

10:07 we're losing them fast we are losing that fast.

10:09 But on the subject of Alphabet, you know this has been a business where the

10:13 cloud, Google's cloud product has lagged behind some of its competitors, the

10:17 likes of Amazon and and Microsoft. And then last night we did get that

10:21 evidence. To your point about the numbers they did

10:23 deliver at the AI side, boosting the cloud path of of that business.

10:27 And obviously I was a feature of the Microsoft story as well.

10:30 Well, the the Google part is also significant here because this is only

10:34 the second quarter that they're actually profitable in this particular unit.

10:36 And I think came out at 900 million. The estimate on Wall Street was about

10:40 621 million for the quarter. So they've shown this profitability.

10:44 But the issue with Alphabet is that they have a lot of ground to make.

10:47 To your point, the dominant players here in the air and in the cloud space, it's

10:50 not Alphabet, it's Microsoft is AWB and by a massive margin, Alphabet actually

10:55 more directly competes with Oracle for cloud share than it does with its

10:59 magnificent peers, if you will. The fact that they are now profitable by

11:04 this much of a margin, by the way, an almost 50% excess margin that they were

11:08 expecting helps them get to scale even faster and even make up that share even

11:13 faster. The numbers are eyewatering if you look

11:16 at how much this business. Is our spending on it.

11:18 Unbelievable figures. And and it's just they are juggernauts

11:23 in terms of their spending right now. One of the things, though, to really

11:26 keep an eye on and keep it very, very carefully is that this is still the

11:30 early stages of the investment. So when you do have this early ramp up,

11:33 the numbers are enormous. Right.

11:35 And it seems that investors actually have quite high tolerance for CapEx on

11:38 AI in a way that maybe they didn't for CapEx on other moonshot projects.

11:42 Yeah. And I know moonshots, the Google term,

11:44 not the massive one, but you know, we had a massive shareholder on just days

11:48 ago being very critical about previous rounds of CapEx, but not this one.

11:51 Yeah. And Microsoft had the same problem with

11:53 Asia. Right.

11:53 And they have continue to say every quarter.

11:55 People are saying, is this the time that it snaps and it doesn't because of the

11:58 massive growth rates we're going to have into that throughout the rest of the

12:00 show? We have plenty more to say on that.

12:01 But there's a couple of other things to watch out in today's session as well.

12:05 About 10 p.m. U.K.

12:06 time, ECB's Mario Santana will be speaking at an event in Frankfurt.

12:10 We'll be keeping an eye out for any commentary coming out of him, as well as

12:12 the ECB 1:30 p.m. London time.

12:14 Of course, that US data that we're keeping an eye on.

12:17 3 p.m. you mesh consumer sentiment data guy I

12:19 think you said it is the final rate. The final rate is not the preliminary

12:23 rate. So we'll see how tradable that is, but

12:25 still something put on your radar. Plus, phase two of the Indian

12:28 parliamentary elections begins. And of course, Antony Blinken is in

12:31 China. So any commentary there is going to be

12:34 crucial. Plus, of course, those big oil earnings

12:36 coming out later in the U.S., ExxonMobil and Chevron.

12:39 Top of the docket. Yeah, we can talk about multiples.

12:43 We can compare and contrast. I keep waiting for you to do it.

12:45 You're not delivering. And I want to talk about yogurt.

12:48 It's Friday. I'll talk about airplanes.

12:51 We can talk about airplanes. We can I.

12:54 Airbus last night was in show I got to talk to in for it which is always a

12:56 pleasure. And and it's interesting that I they are

13:00 if you want to see a supply constrained business take a look at what is

13:04 happening with Airbus right now. I most businesses have sorted out their

13:08 supply chain issues. The aerospace industry is struggling

13:11 beyond belief to sort out its supply chain.

13:14 This feels like a new normal now that it doesn't.

13:16 They can't now say that this is a sort of COVID.

13:18 No, no, no. This is the problem.

13:19 Yes, this is a new normal in this. So I think part so it's taken them a

13:22 long time to come back because it takes a long time to train somebody to build

13:25 an airplane. You kind of want it to work.

13:27 Yeah. Well, yeah, that right.

13:28 Yeah. We've learned that lesson recently.

13:30 And so it takes a long time to bring people back.

13:32 And the supply chain has had the same problem and they went through there was

13:35 a long time in which the supply chain was kind of squeezed.

13:37 So we need to take kind of costs out of the supply chain.

13:40 That is now a real struggle. And there used to be the idea that

13:43 Airbus would also recruit out of its supply chain.

13:45 That's a real struggle as well. But they're also trying to ramp

13:47 production. So they're also seeing huge demand at

13:49 the moment. So you've got the supply chain squeeze

13:51 and you're trying to ramp production at the same time, which is.

13:53 Yeah. And then that because you have to

13:55 prepare for just in case instead of just in time, you're trying to ramp up

13:59 production that weighs on cash flow ways on your working capital.

14:02 And that's what we saw at the US Embassy is a huge they they call it an inventory

14:05 buffer. They're talking about a buffer because

14:07 they want to carry so much of this stock.

14:08 Now, part of that is due to the ramp so that ramping up production.

14:11 So they want to carry more inventory to make sure that that ramp could deliver

14:14 up to the high 75 rates. But but so is it a good news story

14:19 because demand is there or is it a bad news story because the effort to get

14:24 there is so hard. So it's very exciting.

14:26 Morning. We talk planes for tweaking supply

14:28 chains. We are going to talk a lot of other

14:30 things as well. So coming up on the program, a French

14:31 study by the former Bank of France, Governor Christie and new calls for

14:35 urgent actions to deepen European capital markets.

14:38 We will have an exclusive interview with him at 8:30 a.m.

14:42 London time. Could we finally be turning a page in

14:44 the Capital Markets union? We'll see.

14:46 Plus, we speak to Charity in honor of Saxo Markets, who says yet intervention

14:50 without a hawkish BMJ will be futile. That interview coming up at 7:30 a.m.

14:55 UK time. We'll bring you the press conference

14:57 around the BOJ, of course, as well. If you have questions for our guest, if

15:00 you just want to get in touch with us, if you want to talk to the team that

15:02 puts together the programme, Ivanka's TV Go is the function to use on the blog

15:06 back. This is going back.

15:22 This is not a worrying report for the Fed that is telling the Fed that those

15:26 interest rate increases may be having some effect in slowing demand,

15:30 particularly for goods. But it's not alarming by any means.

15:34 I don't see why the Fed would be rushing to be cutting rates in an environment

15:39 where inflation is still sticky. That was true three months ago.

15:43 It's true today. Terrelle Pryor Associates, chief U.S.

15:48 economist and the Stifel Financial CEO there speaking on that resilient U.S.

15:51 economy. With a little bit more analysis here,

15:53 Eric Nelson, macro strategist over at Wells Fargo, joins us this morning on

15:56 set. Good morning.

15:58 We're seeing consumer resilience. You just heard sound that the U.S.

16:02 economy is doing great. There was a data dump yesterday and the

16:05 markets reacted as if it was the exact opposite.

16:09 Was that warranted? I don't think so.

16:11 I think that the market's been waiting waiting for that sign that maybe the

16:15 U.S. economy is starting to roll over.

16:16 And we just didn't get it yesterday. Right.

16:18 You look at the details of that U.S. GDP report.

16:22 Yes, consumer spending was was relatively resilient.

16:24 But look at residential investment. Housing investment is up almost 15%

16:29 annualized. Yeah.

16:30 So rate cuts, rate hikes, rather, have certainly had some impact.

16:34 You look at the level of residential investment is still low, but it's

16:37 starting to recover from a very low base that still feels like it speaks to just

16:41 a lot of excess stimulus. It's still working its way through the

16:44 system for for Americans to be able to make that kind of investment.

16:48 Is that the right read? That's a that's a big piece of it.

16:50 Yeah. And also just look at regular income

16:52 growth, right? So margins in the corporate sector have

16:55 still been pretty high. They've come down, but they're still

16:58 high and the labor market's been strong. Income growth still strong.

17:01 Yes, integration is supporting that, but also that the margin corporate

17:05 environment is still relatively healthy. So that's keeping the consumer going and

17:08 that's keeping the housing market going and the U.S.

17:10 economy overall. Okay, Eric, good morning.

17:12 So we don't worry too much about any weakness in that GDP number.

17:15 They were the reasons we talked about a couple of times then as to why that

17:18 those don't matter or might be transitory.

17:20 Janet Yellen also not worried about the pickup in the type of inflation print we

17:25 got yesterday. Many inflation prints available.

17:27 We got a different PCE today. But she said, I have no doubt that the

17:30 contribution coming from housing costs, this is that component will be falling

17:34 over the coming year. So any concerns around stagflation then?

17:37 We just shouldn't have them? Well, certainly not stagflation.

17:40 The bigger concern here is that the economy is just too hot.

17:43 They have strong growth, strong inflation.

17:44 Right. That's the challenge for the Fed here.

17:47 We'll have to get a real sense of what the Fed's thinking next week.

17:49 So, you know, the Fed has tried so hard to explain away some of these inflation

17:54 readings, the relatively strong growth readings.

17:57 It's increasingly difficult to do that. And I think next week will we may start

18:00 to see a more perceptible tone shift from the Fed on these inflation

18:04 readings. So you think we might get a pivot on the

18:06 pivot? So if the first one came in December,

18:08 this is a pivot on that? Well, the challenge is they're expected

18:12 to announce a slowdown in the pace of quantitative tightening next week.

18:15 So if they just do that and sound dovish on rates in the face of these inflation

18:20 readings, it's becoming a little bit difficult to make that kind of policy

18:25 announcement with the current inflation backdrop.

18:27 So I think the hawks in the committee may start to hold more sway.

18:31 When does the market start to perceive dovish?

18:33 This is a policy mistake and react to the long end by sending yields higher.

18:36 Like to say that's already happening, but how much more could that be?

18:39 Well, again, it depends on if they continue to sort of say the same thing

18:44 over and over again, which is, you know, we're just going to push rate cuts

18:47 further out. So too, two more months.

18:49 Three more months. Just give us more time in the face of

18:52 these inflation readings that that becomes at a certain point less and less

18:55 credible. And I think you look at the dollar's

18:58 reaction yesterday that was really interesting.

19:00 Didn't make any sense to me that strong growth, strong inflation, the dollar

19:03 went down. But you know, to not see further dollar

19:06 follow through yesterday is really surprising.

19:08 Rates don't slow the economy down, I think is the lesson we're learning.

19:11 Financial conditions are the biggest kind of impact on on how the US economy

19:15 performs. Financial conditions are super loose.

19:17 They remain super loose. The pivot back in December probably had

19:20 an effect on that. Does the Fed now need to start knocking

19:23 asset prices to get financial conditions back under control and have some

19:28 transmission into the economy in the way that rates are not doing right now?

19:31 Well, I do think that rates do have an impact.

19:34 I think what's different about this cycle is what's driving you look back in

19:36 2006, 2007 credit driven, it was variable rate mortgages.

19:40 High rates had a very clear impact. High rates do have an impact on

19:43 businesses. They do have an impact on consumer

19:46 credit. You know, credit card delinquencies,

19:47 there's some impact. It's just being completely swamped by

19:51 the fiscal and the income growth. And I think to your point, we need to

19:55 see is more time at relatively higher rates, probably five, maybe five, even

20:00 higher than that along long. And that's the kind of thing that will

20:02 have an impact eventually. But the Fed needs to change course for

20:06 that to happen. Can we zero in on the income growth

20:09 piece piece of us? Are you making the argument and correct

20:12 me if I'm wrong, push back, please, that because there's higher corporate margins

20:16 that's actually bleeding into real wages.

20:19 More to say that because margins. So we're in a classic labor hoarding

20:23 environment right now. Right.

20:24 Hiring has come way down. But if you look at jobless claims

20:27 yesterday, they're extremely low. So firms do not feel compelled to lay

20:31 off workers. They got a burn in 2020 doing that.

20:34 And the margin environment is so strong they don't have to write even though you

20:38 are starting to see, you know, a little bit of pressure there.

20:42 And I think that's really keeping the labor market strong.

20:45 So overall in. Job growth is still strong.

20:49 Wage growth has slowed a little bit, but in aggregate, given how strong job

20:52 growth is. Labor income growth is still really

20:55 solid in aggregate. Hunter said.

20:57 So then talk to us about the stimulus piece.

20:59 The other part of the equation you mentioned.

21:00 When does it run out? When do we stop seeing the effects?

21:03 Well, you know, certainly the we have started to see a lot of the tailwind

21:06 fade on the federal side. But take a look at the state and local

21:10 contribution to U.S. GDP in the last five, five or six

21:13 quarters or so. That's really strong.

21:16 Right. And you look at the exact opposite of

21:18 20, 20, 29, 2010. So you're still getting a tailwind from

21:21 different places on the fiscal side. And I think that's really

21:24 underappreciated. We're getting very excited about tech

21:27 earnings and AI, and it's been a bit of a messy week trying to untangle, you

21:31 know, the winners and the losers and matter hasn't had a good week.

21:33 Others doing much better. On the air front, we deal with it very

21:37 bottom up. We're talking micro from a macro

21:39 perspective. Are you seeing impacts yet?

21:42 Is there anything to say about AI just now?

21:45 I think it's a little bit too early. I think a lot of the AI boom has

21:49 certainly coincided with a productivity pick up.

21:52 But if you dig into the data, you haven't necessarily seen that so much in

21:56 terms of what's actually driving the productivity, driving the investment.

22:00 A lot of it is, again, the fiscal right. We've had a lot of Investment Chips Act,

22:03 the IRA, all these things that have contributed to real genuine investment

22:08 in the U.S. and that is a big driver of this

22:10 productivity bump. What does it mean for the rest of the

22:14 world? Like the BMJ today.

22:17 Struggling currency weakening dramatically, other Asian currencies

22:21 weakening dramatically. We're kind of on tenterhooks waiting to

22:23 see what's going to happen in Europe if the US continues to power ahead and the

22:28 Fed doesn't move until December, maybe even 2025.

22:32 What breaks what is the kind of what's the economic ripple that you're thinking

22:35 about, the waves that are going to spread out into the rest of the economy?

22:39 And how is that imbalance going to grow us versus the rest of the world?

22:44 Well, certainly a strong dollar has as a negative impact on a lot of the world.

22:47 Right. Think about emerging markets who are

22:49 borrowing and borrowing in U.S. dollars.

22:52 You know, the whole world is is effectively short dollars in a way.

22:55 Yep. I think the from a growth perspective,

22:57 there's already economies within the G10 that are starting to show some cracks.

23:01 Sweden, Canada, they're more relying on variable rate debt.

23:04 And I think if those economies are kind of dragged into keeping rates higher for

23:08 longer because of the Fed, that becomes more of a problem for their economies.

23:12 All right, great. Thanks, Tom.

23:13 See us all this Friday. Digesting all the data that we've got.

23:15 We get more of it a little bit later on. We get the personal income data package

23:20 that's going to be coming out. We'll be watching very carefully what is

23:23 happening with those numbers because the Fed will be watching very carefully

23:27 what's happening. We will also be, I suspect, having the

23:30 Japanese watching very carefully, the yen hitting a fresh 34 year low.

23:34 The BOJ hold a great steady tweaks to its language on bond buying.

23:37 Also coming through cherry sonata head of strategy at Saxo is going to be

23:42 joining us. We are 3 minutes away from the BOJ

23:45 presser. We'll also bring you details of that.

23:47 This is live.

24:09 Welcome back. This is Bloomberg Markets today.

24:10 You're looking at live pictures coming from Tokyo.

24:13 This is the governor of the Bank of Japan, of course, governor, speaking at

24:17 that press conference. The event that usually follows the

24:20 decisions around monetary policy as it does today, no change in monetary

24:23 policy, at least no change in the interest rate from the BOJ.

24:26 They tweak their bond language. Of course, it wasn't enough to put a

24:29 line in the sand on the dollar. Yen.

24:32 We're at 156. We're back down to 156 once again.

24:35 So weakness in the yen, weakness we haven't seen since 1990.

24:38 We're watching that very closely. That's part of the conversation around

24:41 Japan. We're also focused on any intervention

24:44 that might come from the Japanese authorities because this weakness in the

24:47 currency is not a new story and it does put certain strains on an economy.

24:51 So we'll monitor the press conference coming to you is just kicking things off

24:55 then in Japan. As that continues, we will get to our

24:58 next conversation. Our next guest says that any

25:00 intervention by Japanese authorities without the support of hawkish policy

25:04 messaging will be futile. Joining us now is Travis Shannon, head

25:09 of strategy at Saxo Markets. Very nice to have you with us.

25:13 So, I mean, this is a point that a lot of people are making that the that the

25:17 weakness in the currency is being driven by interest rate differentials and that

25:20 big and any language around watching with vigilance the or any similar

25:26 language what's going on in markets or indeed any any any tweaks to monetary

25:32 policy not really changing the narrative around those interest rate

25:35 differentials. What's your view?

25:38 Yeah. I mean, actually looking at the

25:39 statement today, Ana, it was really a surprise because there was some

25:43 expectations that were built up because of the comments that had come through in

25:47 the last few days that the DOJ statement would address the impact of effects on

25:55 inflation. And also, there were, I would say, a

25:58 small part of the market that was expecting that because of that likely

26:03 impact on inflation, the BOJ policy stance language or its bond buying

26:10 strategy could shift in a little bit of a hawkish manner.

26:13 But the statement has been so bland, right?

26:16 I mean, it could obviously mean that Europe wants to stress a lot on direct

26:22 communication. You'll see the size of this policy

26:24 statement as well. The length of the statement has been

26:26 sort of short as well. So it certainly looks like there are

26:29 some changes coming. But if they're going to take it that

26:32 slow and given that the U.S. side of the story is dominating where

26:36 Ollie and goes, it certainly looks like for them to reverse this trend and

26:41 dollar yen will remain very, very hard. Hmm.

26:44 Sticking with the rates conversation we see, Governor, he's delivering these

26:48 these comments this morning. He's saying Japan's economy is

26:50 recovering moderately and his weakness in the Japanese economy, the big thing

26:54 that stands in the way of another rate hike because we've had the end of the

26:59 negative interest rate policy in Japan, but we haven't seen a series of rate

27:02 hikes yet. And maybe, you know, that's what some

27:05 people are waiting for. It's very difficult for the Bank of

27:08 Japan to go on a series of rate hikes, as you call it.

27:11 Right. They have fiscal concerns to be cautious

27:13 of. And if you just look at that Tokyo CPI

27:16 print that came out this morning as well, it was considerably weaker than

27:20 expectations than the previous month as well, although, of course, there was

27:23 some one off items in there that played a part, but certainly doesn't look like

27:28 we will continue to get those macro conditions that could support another

27:33 rate hike as well. So, I mean, you know, I think it really

27:36 remains difficult for Bank of Japan to move at an accelerated pace, also

27:40 considering the kind of impact their moves would have on global bond flows.

27:44 Right. I think that is something that they have

27:47 to be really cautious of as well. So if anything, again, I mean, going

27:51 back to the yen, the move really has to come from the U.S.

27:55 side to bring a really sustainable recovery in the Japanese yen.

28:01 Terry, you're going to get Sky. So what do you do if you're the Ministry

28:05 of Finance in Japan and you're watching the yen ticking lower and lower, Lower

28:08 West. Where's the line In the sand?

28:10 Like you just said, we need to watch the facts and its impacts on inflation.

28:14 This is going to add to inflation. The imported inflation story is going to

28:19 be significant if we keep going at this kind of a rate.

28:21 When when do you do something about it? If you're the Ministry of Finance, when

28:25 do you take action? Is it after the US day today?

28:28 Do we wait a bit longer? What is your thoughts on that?

28:31 It certainly seems like they want to remove that mentality around lines in

28:35 the sand and really focus on the the pace at which we are seeing this, the

28:40 acceleration in the Japanese yen. So earlier it was the 152 level in

28:44 dollar and that was being large then 154 155 Now suddenly all these levels have

28:51 been cleared without even, I would say, the narrative taking a leg higher at

28:56 this point. So it does mean that we could, you know,

29:01 test the limits of the Japanese economy. You know, if you go back to some of the

29:06 comments that we got from the ethics chief in Japan earlier, he said that a

29:10 move of about ¥10 in a month against the dollar, that would be the threshold for

29:15 intervention. We're not there yet.

29:17 The early April lows were about one 5151.

29:20 So we have to get ready 160 for that to be a concern.

29:23 And if we don't get to that, by the time we get to next week, then again the

29:28 threshold goes higher. So I think it really depends on the pace

29:32 of the move rather than the levels at this point.

29:36 But but your theory would be that if we don't see more hawkish narratives

29:40 emerging from the authorities in Japan, the DOJ, that if we do see intervention,

29:46 the right reaction would be to sell the yen on the back of that after the

29:50 initial move has faded. It's an opportunity to work against the

29:55 yen rather than kind of retreat from that position.

29:59 Right? Absolutely.

30:00 That's that's exactly what I'm trying to say, Guy, because as I said earlier, the

30:04 sustainable move lowering yen or the sustainable strengthening of the yen can

30:09 only come from the US side where we start to see some economic weakness in

30:14 the US, some more signalling on Fed rate cuts.

30:17 And I think we are just getting further and further away from that rather than

30:21 getting closer to that. At this point, the BOJ can only cover a

30:26 very small distance in that yield differential that we have from 0% to

30:30 five and a half percent in the Fed. From the Fed.

30:32 They can cover a very small part of that distance.

30:35 Right. So any move from the Japanese

30:38 authorities in terms of an intervention, they either have to be coordinated, you

30:42 know, with Korea, like we got a statement with Janet Yellen that could

30:45 make the move a little bit more sustainable or it has to come with that

30:50 turn in the Fed policy which which we are not that it yet.

30:53 So I would think the markets would continue to position to feed the move if

30:58 we were to see a strengthening of the yen on the back of an intervention.

31:03 Tara It's crazy. In London, it feels like at the core of

31:06 this argument that intervention is going to come is that once it's happens, once

31:11 it sets a precedent for it happening over and over and over again, is the DOJ

31:16 and by extension, the Ministry of Finance, do they have enough cash

31:19 reserves to do that? What is what does that look like?

31:23 I mean, you know, they could have the cash reserves.

31:25 But again, like you said, you know, it is going to be an endless amount that

31:29 they need. And as long as the yen continues to be

31:32 driven by the U.S. side, you know, you had this whole GDP

31:36 data coming out this week. Now we are the focus has shifted to the

31:39 march e number due today going into next next week.

31:42 We again have factors like the Fed policy meeting or the quarterly funding

31:47 announcement from the Treasury side. All of those continue to point towards

31:51 more upside in Treasury yields. So even spending a penny here on

31:56 intervention seems futile to me. And I don't even want to look at what

32:00 reserves they have left to really make an effort.

32:04 I think that's a fair argument to make. CHO As we speak to you, we are getting

32:08 more lines coming out of courts, Governor, to really harping on the

32:11 story, saying could be a vital factor to affect inflation, but that monetary

32:14 policy is not targeting control of facts.

32:18 Of course, they will be monitoring those impacts.

32:20 To talk to us a little bit about whether or not the yen even functions as that

32:24 classic safe haven currency anymore given the macro environment that we're

32:28 in. Do capital flows have any bearing on

32:31 what the yen does? That's a very interesting question,

32:35 Kristie. And I would like to emphasize here that

32:38 when you're trying to find a safe haven for your portfolio, you need to

32:42 understand what kind of risks you are hedging.

32:44 Right? If it is the geopolitical risk that you

32:47 are hedging, then, you know, it really comes down to the fact that whether

32:52 treasuries can continue to be a safe haven, because the safe haven aspect of

32:57 the yen was being driven by the fact that Japan has a large holdings of U.S.

33:03 treasuries and they are a safe haven. But given the kind of fiscal environment

33:08 we are in, in the US, you know, the great volatility that we're seeing in

33:12 the U.S. in the long end of it, it surprises me

33:15 that we can still consider the long end Treasuries as a safe haven.

33:19 As a result, the Japanese yen cannot be a safe haven unless the bid comes

33:24 through in a sustainable manner to the treasuries as well.

33:28 Tara, great to see you. Thanks very much indeed for jumping on

33:30 and giving us some instant analysis at the start of the press conference,

33:34 which, as you can see, is ongoing. Church and on head of strategy at Saxo

33:39 Markets. Quick recap.

33:41 Zip line is coming out, which I think is really worth paying attention to.

33:44 Effects could be a reason to mull policy of effects.

33:47 The price trend, i.e. you get imported inflation coming

33:50 through as a result of this weekend that we are seeing.

33:54 Couple of things I want to mention. First of all, if you want to listen to

33:57 what Euro is saying, you can do so on your Bloomberg terminal live go is the

34:01 function that you can use to make that happen.

34:02 The other thing is there is a fantastic live blog that is currently running that

34:06 will give you all the insights and analysis as to what is being said and

34:09 its implication for the market. So all of that available on your

34:13 Bloomberg. We'll continue to monitor what is

34:15 happening with that press conference, but we're going to move on as well.

34:17 We're going to talk about tech, Microsoft and Alphabet reaping the

34:20 rewards of their spending spree. The earnings were strong last night.

34:24 Are we down to the Magnificent Three? We're going to talk about that next.

34:27 This is Bloomberg.

34:47 Welcome back to markets today. We are 17 minutes away from the start of

34:50 cash trading here in Europe. There's a lot going on in the Asia

34:53 session, though. We've been through the BOJ story, no

34:55 change in rates and the yen continues to slide.

34:58 That's the headline really 156 is where we trade.

35:00 Let's talk about where we are on these markets in 2 minutes with our markets

35:03 live, executive editor Mark Cudmore who's with us this morning.

35:06 Not any change to your thinking then in the on the Japanese currency.

35:10 Any thoughts on timing of any intervention?

35:12 We were just hearing from our guest about the futility of the intervention.

35:15 If the US doesn't do something that changes the dynamic on interest rates.

35:21 Yeah. Good morning on it.

35:23 No major change. I am still structurally very bearish.

35:27 The end. I still think that if the move coming in

35:30 intervene the discretionary macro hedge fund community will excitedly use that

35:35 intervention as a chance to just sell again at better levels.

35:38 I don't expect intervention. Obviously it's a risk if dollar yen is

35:43 much higher by tonight. I'm told by some of my colleagues, some

35:47 smart colleagues in Japan, one 5760 might be the level to watch.

35:51 I kind of think it's got to be somewhere near 160 probably before the IMF is

35:56 going to intervene. When we're in a world where US yields

35:59 are going to continue to drift higher. Okay.

36:03 There's so much to talk about this morning, Mark.

36:05 Let's go from what's going on in currency markets to what's happening in

36:08 metals. Copper hitting 0,000 a tonne in London

36:11 for the first time since 2020. So which isn't that long ago.

36:14 But interesting dynamics in this market given the M&A excitements in the market

36:18 that we covered a lot yesterday. I know your colleagues have been writing

36:21 about how the short term direction might be a little opaque.

36:24 I think this was on the markets like just yesterday, but maybe the medium

36:27 term dynamic can be a little more solid in terms of the copper price.

36:30 And we all know that this is an important metal for transition.

36:33 What do you make of this latest move higher in copper?

36:37 Yeah. Look, I think that the 0,000 just

36:39 symbolic as those lovely round numbers gets great headlines, they all get

36:42 excited. But it's a little bit of an arbitrary

36:44 level. The backdrop story here is that we're

36:47 still seeing an incredible reflationary dynamic in commodities, unlike while

36:51 some of the you know, some of the gains have come out of oil markets, which is

36:55 kind of the benchmark one to watch. And obviously the most important

36:58 commodity. The fact is the Bloomberg Commodity spot

37:01 index is right up at the highs and it's just an incredible gains over the last

37:06 two weeks. In fact, other commodities are gaining

37:08 so much that they're making up for the fact that oil prices have pulled back

37:11 from the highs. And this is another dynamic that is

37:14 going to feed through to yields. It's going to feed through to yields in

37:16 a couple of months. So when we start running out of kind of

37:18 the upward momentum from the Fed readjustment, we'll get another one from

37:21 commodity inflation. Yeah, it's all sounding a little higher

37:25 for longer, isn't it? Mark, thank you so much.

37:26 Big Bear Markets Live executive editor Mark Cudmore joining us there.

37:29 Remember, you can get the Markets live blog on the Bloomberg terminal.

37:32 MLive go is the functions usual here for mark and all the other members of the

37:36 markets live team so that I can figure out exactly what is happening on that

37:40 front. A strong air demand has been cited as

37:43 the key driver of positive earnings we got last night from Microsoft.

37:46 We also got them from from Alphabet, the CFOs of both of the tech giant tech

37:51 giants. It's Friday.

37:53 It's been long week, express optimism on their earnings calls.

37:58 Used with our financial results for the first quarter, driven in particular by

38:02 strength in search and cloud, as well as the ongoing efforts to durably

38:07 re-engineer our cost base. That's why 25 that focus and execution

38:12 should again lead to double digit revenue and operating income growth to

38:17 scale to meet the growing demand signal for our cloud and AI products.

38:21 We expect our 25 capital expenditures to be higher than in FY 24.

38:27 Are we down to the Magnificent Three? Kind of felt like it after last night's.

38:31 Alex Webb joins us to give us some perspective on what we saw yesterday

38:35 from these two businesses. They seem to be figuring out a way to at

38:40 least turn the spending into something real, which I think is a critical

38:44 differentiator between some of the companies that are spending huge amounts

38:49 of money. I matter versus Microsoft feels like a

38:51 different story at the moment. Are we beginning to kind of sort of

38:55 titrate out the differences between these companies and beginning to figure

38:59 out who's actually going to win in the air race and who's going to come second,

39:02 third, fourth and fifth? I mean, certainly in this first wave

39:05 where it is very much an enterprise products and of course, for Microsoft

39:09 and Google, they have platforms on which to build that enterprise product through

39:12 which to sell it, namely the cloud. Right matter does not have that matter

39:16 is consumer facing it. Obviously its product is for the

39:19 enterprise. It's advertising, but it is just

39:21 advertising. Google and Microsoft, they are selling a

39:24 lot of functionality to big companies to use on their clouds.

39:29 We see with Microsoft about five percentage points of the cloud revenue,

39:33 a little bit more than that, actually seven percentage points to cloud revenue

39:36 in the most recent quarter was attributable to AI.

39:39 So it is in that part of the business that they have an edge.

39:42 When we're talking about that edge, though, there is a real competition

39:45 dynamic between Alphabet and Microsoft in getting that cloud demand.

39:48 How much progress can Alphabet actually make given Microsoft's kind of dominance

39:53 in the space? Well, that has been the question for

39:56 Google's cloud for much of the past decade or so.

39:58 Really, what we're seeing now is they are starting to penetrate and it's AI

40:02 that is letting them do that. When we think about the real leaders in

40:06 this space, it is really Openai and Google.

40:08 And there are a bunch of other companies coming up, not least anthropic, which

40:11 has a relationship with Amazon. Amazon is the big sort of whatever for

40:15 300 £400 gorilla in the room. Yeah but and Google was expect was

40:20 predicted to have 600 and something million dollars of profit from the cloud

40:23 in the quarter. It had $900 billion.

40:26 So it's a huge beat. Just from that business, it is really

40:29 starting to penetrate in a way that it hadn't been before I came along.

40:32 Now, creating new gorillas, perhaps not so much the case for Masa.

40:35 I mean, that's a business that's had a very difficult week.

40:39 Why is that business not managing to turn this new technology into something

40:43 it can monetize? Well, I think first is the reasons I

40:46 said, you know, that it isn't it doesn't have the same enterprise facing

40:49 business. But I think secondly, I think some of

40:51 the problems we've seen with matter have partly been about communication, really,

40:55 that they are have been they're expanding their CapEx on particularly AI

41:01 type things they need for revolution data

41:05 centers, personnel, that sort of thing. But the stock has more than doubled over

41:10 the past 12 months. We've not seen that same expansion at

41:13 Google, but the telegraphing at face matter was very much we're going to keep

41:17 our costs under control. This is not going to be we've had a year

41:20 of efficiency. Google, we didn't really hear any of

41:23 that. They did cut jobs.

41:24 They did actually introduce more of a focus on costs.

41:27 But the communication was a little bit more cautious than what we saw at

41:30 Facebook. But this year they were just about to

41:33 see us. Alex Webb How much of this stuff?

41:37 Is actually going to turn into a viable business model.

41:40 I think it's an open question. Let's talk about some of the other

41:42 stocks of watching here in Europe. This one, we've had a whole range of

41:44 numbers out over the last 24 hours, kind of started last night with Airbus.

41:48 We move into NatWest this morning. Let's put it all together with Joey

41:51 still. Morning, guys.

41:52 Airbus has raised its output target for the A350, Widebody long haul jet.

41:58 They now expect to produce around 12 jets a month from 2028 above the ten

42:03 jets a month previously. And that is something that could

42:06 potentially help the stock outperform continuously versus the old rival

42:10 Boeing. That is something that we have seen and

42:13 a lot of analysts do have positive ratings on this, around 20 buy ratings

42:17 versus just a single sell on that stock. However, it did get more negative

42:22 further down in the statement and on the analyst call as well, with the company

42:26 actually warning of continued supply chain issues affecting their ramp up,

42:30 limiting their ability to produce more jets, and also the geopolitical

42:35 situation also weighing on the earnings. And as such, the event, the earnings

42:39 before interest and tax did actually miss expectations.

42:42 And as a result, we saw a drop in the idea of the US stock overnight.

42:46 So that one did fall 4%. Potentially that outperformance versus

42:50 Boeing won't continue in the short term, at least that we're looking at The big

42:55 story of the week, Anglo American, we have got an official statement finally

43:00 officially rejecting the takeover proposal from BHP and they are quite

43:05 strong in what they say. So they say that the proposal is

43:08 opportunistic and fails to fully value Anglo American prospects.

43:13 I also take issue with the structure of the deal in this quote here, saying it's

43:17 highly unattractive and creates uncertainty and execution risk for Anglo

43:22 American shareholders. Now we'll take a look at what the stock

43:25 did following this approach. We can see that huge jump and analysts

43:29 are noting that it actually trades above where the implied takeover target price

43:34 would be potentially showing that some analysts

43:38 and traders expect a higher bid to come in for that one.

43:42 We're going to take a look at BHP as well over in Australia, because that one

43:45 did drop around 5%. It had the biggest decline in seven

43:49 months overnight on the Sydney Exchange, according to our data.

43:53 There it is on the screen, down 5.2% for BHP.

43:56 Finally, here in the UK, we've got NatWest pretty positive across the board

44:00 here. The net interest margins are in line

44:03 with expectations. Profits doing pretty well.

44:05 They stock has had a bumpy ride over the past year.

44:08 Wave the CEO leaving following the fallout with Nigel Farage and the Coutts

44:13 Bank account here. Some of the main things on the screen

44:15 here, signs of improving consumer confidence.

44:17 As I say, net interest margins stable. The stock has rallied about 65% since an

44:23 October profit warning. Those are potentially some of that

44:26 positivity priced in. Keep an eye on NatWest over in London.

44:30 Joe, thanks very much. Equities reporter Jay Lisa with the

44:32 latest on all of those names to watch at the start of trade this Friday morning.

44:35 Let's get back to the Japanese story. Governor Wade is still speaking at the

44:37 BMJ. I'm drawn to lines that put the story

44:41 front and center with regards to monetary policy weekend, not having a

44:44 big impact on underlying prices. Yes, he's one of the lines he gave us

44:47 some minutes ago and then say the impact of our moves on inflation is usually

44:52 temporary. So, you know, if you're looking for

44:54 reasons why they won't be in a hurry to intervene or desperate to intervene,

44:58 then you can see some. But obviously other views are also

45:00 coming through in this press conference this morning.

45:02 It's interesting how he's talking about the facts.

45:05 He clearly doesn't feel that the story yet is at the point where it's going to

45:09 have a material impact on inflation. At what point does that become a problem

45:14 and how does policy react to it? I think is a question that I think he's

45:17 trying to still figure out. The two lines that stuck out to me that

45:19 are still rolling out. As he said, the impact of the maximum

45:22 inflation is temporary is exactly what the market is saying.

45:25 It's not temporary. Exactly.

45:27 The oil price has not been mentioned yet, which is significant.

45:29 It's historically been a big weight on that.

45:31 He also says that they're not using bond buying as a policy tool, which I think

45:35 is interesting because they invented bond buying as a policy tool, because if

45:39 he doesn't want to, does he? You know, he wants to roll that back at

45:44 Nomura's CFO saying they expect the yen weakening to correct when the Fed cuts

45:49 rates, which goes back to the conversation we were having with our

45:52 guest earlier on this hour saying that this is actually in the hands of the US

45:55 rather than the Japanese. Now, coming up, we'll have the market

45:57 open for you. We'll get you the latest on European

46:01 trade. It's been a busy week.

46:02 This is going back.

46:18 Friday, the 26th. Welcome back, folks.

46:19 Lots to talk about this morning. We have, obviously the macro story that

46:22 is unfolding. We have data out of the United States a

46:24 little bit later on. Right now, we're dealing with the Bank

46:27 of Japan, but we also are building our way towards in a minutes and 40 seconds,

46:31 the European equity market open, which feels relative to the last few days in

46:35 terms of the volume of corporates that are having to plug in to these numbers,

46:39 like we're a little holiday this morning we got NatWest to deal with.

46:42 I think we've got a little bit of the mining story to fold in, but but it

46:45 hasn't felt quite as fast and frenetic. It feels a little more casual, doesn't

46:48 it? But yes, NatWest could be interesting,

46:49 beating estimates, growing consumer confidence.

46:51 Back to your point from the top of the program that we are seeing that story

46:54 develop here in the UK. But really it is a day where we're

46:57 focused on the macro and we've been focused on the DOJ.

47:00 That press conference at the BOJ ongoing and a bit of movement in effects.

47:04 Yeah, we are seeing a little bit of pop and yen as well, Remember has gone

47:06 through that 156 level. We're still kind of seeing what the

47:08 reaction is too. But the latest headline coming out of

47:11 governor you to simply that they're very close to stable inflation if their

47:15 outlook materializes, which really to me just seems like they're saying if all

47:19 goes to plan, we will also execute as we've been forecasting, which to me

47:23 seems like a little bit of nothing. BURGER But it sounds that central bank I

47:25 was about to say, but it's something that the markets seem to be reacting to

47:29 of course. Dollar yen one 5636 at the moment it's a

47:31 couple of stocks are worth watching totally I think is going to be

47:34 interesting. Looks like that's going to be hold high

47:35 this morning a monday. The inflow number actually really strong

47:38 over Monday, which I think is worth paying attention to as well.

47:42 AMS Osram, which has had a terrible run recently and looks like the revenue line

47:47 is beaten back. Could be a little bit of a see a little

47:50 bit of a pick up as well. But I would think maybe some sort of

47:52 bottoming out in some of the European chip story.

47:54 Will Yeah, In terms of the techniques, we'll certainly look for a bit of

47:57 whipsawing in that sector because yesterday this on yesterday we were all

47:59 weighed down by doom and gloom around Masa.

48:01 Today's a different story from the likes of Alphabet and from Microsoft.

48:05 So Nasdaq futures are higher. Where will that leave the tech sector,

48:08 which was on the back foot yesterday, down by just over 1% in Europe.

48:12 So European equity markets just opening up.

48:14 Then the Footsie 100 is pretty flat. But just out of the gates this morning,

48:18 waiting for others of the DAX is open now up by 1/10 of a percent.

48:22 In terms of where we are, of course, these European equity markets then

48:24 seems, yes, we are getting that bounce back in technology.

48:27 So it was one of the sectors under pressure yesterday.

48:29 That was the measure effects. We now have a different story to tell.

48:33 We've got very short term memories. It seems that we're over, Max, over.

48:36 We're now in the alphabet and and the Microsoft numbers, the potential of AI

48:40 to deliver really front and center. And so we see the technology sector, the

48:43 best performing here in Europe this morning.

48:46 Airbus is down, unsurprisingly. Actually, the idea is got hit a little

48:48 bit more last night. So Airbus is only down by 6/10 of 1% at

48:52 the moment. Worth mentioning, there's a whole bunch

48:54 of goods in the market today. So you got ABN Amro going next.

48:58 BSF is XD. Munich Re L'Oreal L'Oreal at the moment

49:03 is the big loser in terms of the points impact on the 600, but it's gone

49:07 ex-dividend, so that's worth mentioning here.

49:09 We talked a little about this commodity move here as well.

49:10 Some of the bigger index contributors at least is Rio Tinto and Glencore as well.

49:15 Gun cautious look at their numbers, about 12% of the revenue to that copper

49:18 exporters. I wonder if there's a macro read through

49:20 if some of the miners here this morning that you're seeing is starting to pare

49:23 back a little bit, but you didn't initially see that move.

49:26 I'm not getting an opening price on BHP yet, though, so we will see what that

49:29 looks like after after the news that their offer was basically rejected from

49:33 Anglo American. Yeah, there's a number of lines on the

49:34 on the basic resources sector aren't there.

49:36 There's, there's the nervousness perhaps around who's going to come in next with

49:40 what for Anglo and how messy will that get.

49:42 How expensive might that asset become if if it gets complicated and if there are

49:47 other players looking to get hold of it. And there are all kinds of complexities

49:50 behind that. We talked about that yesterday.

49:51 But then on the other side, there's the higher commodities price.

49:54 We were talking about that with mark up more in the copper prices at the top of

49:56 the show jumps, you know, through another big figure.

49:59 There's a whole of of gold miners as well.

50:01 I think Barrick is one of them that not only produces a lot of gold, but now

50:04 produces a lot of copper as well. So it's going to be interesting to see

50:07 how this kind of this copper story ripples out, not just out of your kind

50:10 of traditional, well known copper miners, but into into the rest of the

50:15 space as well. Airbus is now falling where it's the

50:18 biggest points loss on the on the Stoxx 600 down by 1.4%.

50:23 But it's interesting, some of the growth stocks are coming back today quite

50:25 nicely. Smells up.

50:26 Novo is up. LVMH is having a good day.

50:28 SAP bouncing back as well. Rémy Cointreau is another one rising

50:32 just shy of 7%. Fourth quarter revenue beat when we talk

50:35 about the luxury space the consumer demand there but it's a premiumization

50:38 only It's the premiumization and luxury.

50:41 Two different things, apparently. Yes, I'm American.

50:45 I don't know the difference. Electrolux also gaining.

50:49 So, you know, to your point, Christine, we're seeing some better response today

50:53 to some of the earnings stories. Rémy Cointreau Electrolux stands out as

50:56 well. That's actually an earnings story, but

50:59 also a change of leadership story. So we'll continue to watch those those

51:03 businesses as that those stories continue to develop.

51:06 Let's just recap what we've been getting from the DOJ.

51:09 Declining to comment on short term moves is the latest headline that I see that

51:14 he has commented on based on the relationship between.

51:17 The weakness in the yen and inflation. That has been something he's talked

51:21 about. You wait to said earlier on that the

51:22 impact on effect moves on inflation is usually temporary.

51:26 Let's get into a conversation about this.

51:27 He's still speaking in Japan, as you can see there.

51:30 Downing, chief investment officer for Bloomberg fixed Income, joins us plenty

51:33 to say about the Bank of Japan. Mark, very nice to have you with us.

51:36 Let's start there, shall we? The link between the weakness in the

51:40 currency and inflation in Japan, of course, it pushes up the price of

51:43 importing things like oil and a whole load of other stuff.

51:46 It benefits, of course, some of the export businesses.

51:49 Governor, you wait to say the impact of moves on inflation is usually temporary.

51:53 What are your thoughts on that front? What I think we are seeing in Japan is,

51:58 is the inflation expectations are on the rise.

52:02 I think for many years what we've seen in Japan across society has been a

52:06 pretty depressed mindset, expecting prices to stagnate and to drop.

52:13 But what we're really witnessing in Japan is the fact that we've now had a

52:18 couple of years or more of inflation above 2%.

52:23 And I think the idea of inflation is becoming more normalized.

52:25 So I think the governor is wrong here. I think that if we do see a further

52:29 overshoot in inflation, this is bleeding back into inflation expectations.

52:33 Remember, we've just had a wage round where wages have needed to go up more

52:37 than 5%. The labour market is very tight.

52:40 That will be feeding back into wages as well.

52:42 So we really do see this engine between sort of wages and prices really

52:47 connecting here and we CapEx is really feeding into this.

52:51 So I think the bank has been consistently vocal on underestimating

52:56 inflation. It's going to be continued to be sort of

52:59 more low on on on its inflation forecasts because inflation is going to

53:04 keep surprising them to the upside. And I think the effect is an important

53:07 engine of that. Okay.

53:09 And just to recap where we are on the facts, 156 is where we trade on dollar

53:14 against the yen continues to weaken. Mark, if you think that that yen

53:17 weakness is going to snap at some point, are you pushing out further into the

53:21 future the time when that happens, given the strength of the US economy?

53:26 As you know, to some extent, exceptionalism and the persistence,

53:29 therefore, of those interest rate differentials, does that that point at

53:32 which the yen snaps snaps higher, I mean, does does that get pushed out?

53:38 I think it certainly does. I think that in effect, terms, what

53:43 you're looking at is the the ratio of carry relative to volatility.

53:47 And at the moment, the carry advantage is is way too generous.

53:51 And so in a way, investors incented to carry on selling the yen if that sort of

53:59 policy gap is not closing. So obviously with the sort of US rate

54:02 expectations moving since the start of the year, that has really exposed Japan

54:07 left it in a difficult position. In a sense it feels like.

54:10 So the Japan has been out there almost playing for the US recession, preparing

54:14 for US rates to come down, but they're not.

54:17 And what we really need to see is the the BOJ really adjust to that reality.

54:23 But at the moment it feels like the BOJ a slow two to come come to that game.

54:30 And in our sense, we do believe that they're now behind the curve and they'll

54:35 probably look back at this as potentially a bit of a policy error.

54:40 But I think that that will become clearer as inflation sort of lose sight.

54:46 Mark, you say that the Fed doesn't look like it's in the business of cutting

54:49 rates. I would now price of December.

54:51 Does this embassy reasonable? We're going to see any rate cuts this

54:54 year. Yeah.

54:57 So on on the Fed, I think it's certainly a very open question.

55:01 The economy remains strong, but intrinsically I would say that having

55:05 been in DC recently, there is a clear sense that I think that Powell would

55:09 like to cut rates if he's got any chance to do so whatsoever.

55:13 In a way, I'm sure he would like the moniker of being the central bank of the

55:18 achieve the soft landing and secure his place in the Hall of Fame, so to speak.

55:23 So I think that any data excuse to cut rates and also to help Biden into the

55:28 election, I think he will look to take it.

55:30 So I wouldn't rule out the idea that we have a rate cut in the second half of

55:34 the year. All of that said, it does require a

55:38 better inflation data. But just on that particular point, one

55:42 of the things that we had been highlighting a few months ago, we

55:45 thought that the seasonals on inflation data in the US were quite problematic in

55:50 Q1. They do look a little bit better to us

55:52 in Q2. So not the core PC data today that we'll

55:57 see, but maybe in that in a month's time, in two months time, the data could

56:01 look a little bit more friendly. So I wouldn't be closing the door on

56:04 that possibility just yet. But if the data remain as they are, the

56:10 moments are in a position where the market will regard any early rate cut

56:15 from the Fed as a policy mistake, i.e. the danger is that inflation becomes

56:19 more embedded and you see a bigger move at the long end.

56:23 Yeah, I think in many respects it's you do need the data to change to justify

56:29 it. As I said, I think the Powell would like

56:31 to, but he kind of needs the data to cooperate and it's not at the moment.

56:36 The truth of the matter is the US economy is is moving ahead very nicely.

56:40 I know that we had a weak GDP print yesterday, but that was a bit of a

56:44 statistical quirk that I'm very confident will end up being revised the

56:47 way many other economic indicators continue to look very robust in the US.

56:54 And I think the in terms of the the trajectory here, the baseline really is

57:00 for rates kind of going nowhere. I do think the path to a rate hike,

57:05 though, remains very high. I think there'll be a real reluctance to

57:09 raise rates again ahead of the election. I think inflation would need to get a

57:12 lot worse for that to be on the table. So I think broadly speaking, it's

57:18 staying as we are higher for longer. Um, but certainly what we seem to be

57:22 seeing at the minute is the economy's coping.

57:25 Are you okay with rates at this sort of level?

57:29 Mark, how are you viewing Japanese assets, though?

57:32 Is the short JGB trade still at play in terms of being a hedge?

57:36 Is the Japanese yen still offering that kind of value as a part of the carry

57:41 trade? Do you even want exposure to Japanese

57:44 assets right now given the real lack of action from the BOJ?

57:50 Well, yes, actually, you really do want exposure to Japanese assets on the fixed

57:54 income side. You want that exposure to be on the

57:56 short side, being convinced that inflation's going

58:00 to be moving higher, being convinced that the BOJ is behind the curve.

58:04 I think being short JGBs continues to be a very compelling way to run.

58:09 I continue to look at that through the lens of something that looks very

58:13 asymmetric. The likelihood of yields rising is is

58:17 far greater than the likelihood of yields going down at this particular

58:21 point. And actually, the cost to carry on being

58:23 short JGBs is it is very little. So this is a position you can sit on and

58:28 you should be sitting on having strong conviction that eventually yields go

58:32 higher. But by contrast,

58:35 you should be looking at Japanese equities and be saying, this looks

58:38 great. I mean, Japan is reflecting things are

58:40 changing. In Japan, there's a very bullish

58:43 reflationary story to be made for Japanese stocks.

58:46 I can pick your novel All the Nikolai, but is certainly a big one to the

58:50 topside. And certainly I would have thought that

58:52 this is a stock market that will continue to outperform peers.

58:56 And I also think that is interesting. When I'm in Tokyo, as I was recently

59:01 meeting a lot of Japanese colleagues, a lot of them have lived in this lost

59:05 generation. The first time almost gave up hope about

59:08 the future, but there's a real brightening of sentiment.

59:12 All of my colleagues that I know are now looking to buy Japanese stocks, buy

59:15 property. They're trying to convince me to buy

59:18 condo in Tokyo as well. I'm not sure where I'll be doing that,

59:21 but I certainly am bullish on the on the stock side.

59:25 But when it comes to the folks, leave that alone for the time being.

59:28 There will be a moment when you want to buy the yen as a currency because it's

59:32 really cheap. But but now is not that moment.

59:37 Well, I can't ask you about Tokyo real estate.

59:39 Admittedly, Mark, I haven't looked into it myself.

59:41 But I do want to ask you about the oil price here.

59:43 When we're talking about that important inflation coming into Japan, how much of

59:47 the oil story is a leading indicator? So liquor oil prices are being governed

59:54 by different dynamics. And and so I think that the fact that we

59:59 have the elevated geopolitical risks and situation in the Middle East is going to

01:00:04 keep certainly a floor under oil prices, if

01:00:08 not sort of pose an upside risk there. So so I mean, the dynamic on oil is the

01:00:14 dynamic in oil. The fact that oil is a dollar priced

01:00:18 commodity means that in Japan, which is very dependent on energy imports in

01:00:24 terms of oil. When you translate that into yen, it

01:00:27 means that energy inflation is going to continue to be a theme in

01:00:32 Japan this year. Thanks so much, Mark.

01:00:36 Thanks for joining us. Have a good weekend.

01:00:37 When we get there, Moms housing chief investment officer for Bay Fixed Income.

01:00:41 We appreciate your time. Some interesting lines coming out of us.

01:00:45 Secretary of State Antony Blinken is visit to China.

01:00:47 He is going to be meeting with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping in

01:00:51 Beijing. This conversation, we knew he was there.

01:00:54 Of course, he was there yesterday and we knew he was staying on for conversations

01:00:58 with top diplomats over in China. But this new information that he's going

01:01:01 to be meeting, Xi Jinping, this as relationships described by China is

01:01:06 stabilizing. But clearly, a lot of negatives in those

01:01:09 relationships as well and a lot to talk about.

01:01:10 So we'll continue to monitor and get an update on that later in the program.

01:01:14 We will all watching that very carefully.

01:01:15 Also watching what is happening. The stock story this morning.

01:01:17 Let's take a quick look at what is happening with the cool six, the stocks

01:01:20 that we pay attention to across Europe to just give us a steer on what the

01:01:24 bigger picture looks like. And as you can see, we are a bit across

01:01:28 the board this morning. Nestlé bouncing back after yesterday's

01:01:31 disappointments. We've seen Schneider up as small as is,

01:01:35 is driving the markets certainly this morning, talking of driving Ferraris up,

01:01:39 they're all up. Are there any other stocks that we need

01:01:42 to be worrying about? There certainly are.

01:01:43 Joe. Eastern is watching those.

01:01:46 So one area that isn't catching a bit today is the aero and auto space sector

01:01:51 led lower by Airbus. We did get those better than expected

01:01:54 order numbers and production numbers from the company yesterday.

01:01:57 But the issue is the supply chains, they're not able to ramp up as quickly

01:02:01 as expected. And as a result, the earnings estimates

01:02:04 are lower than expected. That one down 2%.

01:02:06 Bear in mind, it is up massively when you compare versus Boeing, the big rival

01:02:11 year to date. I think Boeing nursing a loss of double

01:02:14 digit percent, whereas Airbus going the other way.

01:02:16 Safran, meanwhile, the engine maker, had some strong numbers out of them as well,

01:02:20 but declining 0.9% over in France potentially.

01:02:23 But have a read across coming in that they are actually a supplier to Airbus

01:02:27 themselves. The low this is in car parts had some

01:02:31 weak margins out of them over in France today.

01:02:33 That stock coming down 2% for Continental to see if there was any read

01:02:37 across. But at the moment, that one just ticking

01:02:39 higher was a little bit lower. As I say, that sector looking pretty

01:02:42 weak today. Then in terms of some other earnings, we

01:02:45 had NatWest at seven and that one did break up 4% this morning.

01:02:49 It has had a big rally since October. This as the outlook for the UK economy

01:02:54 and rates does improve at a slump last year as the CEO unexpectedly left and

01:02:58 those next interest margins today are looking pretty firm for them.

01:03:03 One stock saying a big drop though, over in Amsterdam, EMC, This is in chemicals,

01:03:07 it's agricultural chemicals. It thinks weakness out of them this

01:03:10 morning. That one is weighing on the chemical

01:03:12 space Totalenergies the big total oil firm.

01:03:17 Oil price is pretty strong at the moment, of course.

01:03:19 So that means that earnings do look pretty strong.

01:03:21 They're actually doing a $2 billion buyback I saw breaking on the headlines

01:03:25 there and that stock just taking higher, but it has had a good run with the other

01:03:30 energy stocks. Rémy Cointreau.

01:03:31 Finally some decent numbers from the drinks space.

01:03:34 We've had a swathe of profit warnings out of drinks over the past year or so

01:03:38 but Remy finally seeing some better sales.

01:03:40 Some of that in the US does seem to be stabilizing for the maker of Cointreau

01:03:46 so that one gaining 4%. Here's the deal spot Anglo American down

01:03:50 0.7%. We had an 11% gain for the stock

01:03:53 yesterday following that unsolicited bid proposal from BHP, which I have firmly

01:03:59 rejected today, saying it does undervalue their company.

01:04:03 BHP secondary listing is declining once again in London.

01:04:06 The Australian shares fell around 5% overnight, the biggest drop in seven

01:04:10 months for that stock phase. And proof Daniel Kozinski, the Czech

01:04:14 billionaire, is going to be buying a stake in their steel business, according

01:04:17 to a report overnight. He's the billionaire that's looking to

01:04:20 buy the Royal Mail. Royal Mail owner excuse me, I.D.s in

01:04:25 London. So he's doing a lot of deals at the

01:04:27 moment. Got some spare cash.

01:04:28 He's splashing it and he's buying estate and things in great style.

01:04:31 That one's up 9% today. Quick look at CVC, the long awaited

01:04:36 listing of the private equity giant over in Amsterdam.

01:04:40 We haven't got a normal ticker price on that, but we can see that 23% gain.

01:04:46 It did list at 14 years of pace. Here's the price 1725 at the moment.

01:04:51 So investors getting a decent return on the first day of trading for CVC.

01:04:56 As I say, the private equity firm listing.

01:04:57 Finally we have got a rights exchange carrying debt gets a downgrade.

01:05:01 Probably not too surprising given we did see those weak earnings.

01:05:05 Cowin is the one doing the damage. Takes it down to hope and in fact, the

01:05:08 stock gaining 2% still down for the week given those weaker legs earlier in the

01:05:13 week. Keep an eye on Carrie in Paris.

01:05:15 Thank you so much, Joe. The news coming actually faster this

01:05:18 morning. Now to reason from our equities teams

01:05:20 having a busy morning. There's that CBC listing story which I'm

01:05:23 glad that we got to talk about. I also want to talk to you about

01:05:25 Darktrace, the tech business listed here in the UK, getting an offer from Tomei

01:05:31 Bravo. And this seems to be agreed by both

01:05:33 parties, so don't. Agreeing to this.

01:05:36 Pleased to announce they've reached agreement on the terms of a recommended

01:05:40 all cash acquisition. The price on this 7.75, if you put that

01:05:44 into pounds, the equivalent value of the acquisition is 600 $0.20 per share.

01:05:50 It was certainly suspended for a moment. That one, we'll see where that one

01:05:54 heads. We're listing stocks fairly for sort of

01:05:57 foster ferociously here in the UK at the moment, it seems to be the case.

01:06:00 We will talk more about capital markets activity.

01:06:02 A busy day for that coming up. NatWest beat earnings estimates in the

01:06:05 first quarter. We'll be discussing all of those results

01:06:07 and the wider banking sector next. This is playback.

01:06:26 21 minutes into the session. NatWest shares traded higher this

01:06:29 morning. This after the bank posted a better than

01:06:31 expected first quarter results. Lending and deposits actually increased

01:06:35 amid signs of improving consumer confidence.

01:06:38 You've seen that also in the consumer confidence data that we've seen out of

01:06:42 the UK this morning. Sam Onstad joins us now from the Markets

01:06:44 Today blog. In some ways, you want these numbers to

01:06:48 be boring. You want these numbers to actually

01:06:50 deliver nothing. And Lloyds was very much the same,

01:06:52 actually, I felt earlier on in the week. But on the other hand, I can't quite

01:06:56 work out whether you want them to be exciting because in theory we're about

01:06:59 to sell a whole chunk of this stuff to the public.

01:07:02 Yeah, of specifically from NatWest point of view, I agree.

01:07:06 You sort of need a little bit more maybe to get excitement going in NatWest.

01:07:10 I think their results today, you know, they were coming in with, I would say,

01:07:13 slightly lower expectations than you had for for Barclays and for Lloyds because

01:07:16 their net interest margins have been under a bit more pressure.

01:07:20 And actually for all those banks, really the expectations have been relatively

01:07:23 low because activity in the mortgage market's been a bit lower, higher

01:07:26 redemptions, more people paying back their mortgages.

01:07:28 And then also that move over to savings accounts has sort of weighed on margins

01:07:32 a bit. So this quarter, next quarter, probably

01:07:34 not going to provide too much excitement, but then it's later in the

01:07:37 year when hopefully that will turn out. But yeah, there's a lot of volatility in

01:07:41 our expectations around when we get cuts from the Bank of England.

01:07:44 And that's playing havoc, no doubt with the expectations that these banks have

01:07:47 for their own net interest margin. I mean, we had that conversation with

01:07:50 Ben Quant yesterday over at Barclays where he's saying, you know, we were on

01:07:53 a 90 basis point round trip. We saw the yield at those yield

01:07:57 expectations coming down, then back off again.

01:07:59 It's there's a lot of volatility in here.

01:08:01 There is this an interesting comparison with Barclays?

01:08:05 So Barclays is a smaller mortgage lender, still a major one in the UK, but

01:08:08 smaller than NatWest is much more than Lloyds.

01:08:11 And those extra volumes mean that you do get a little bit more weakness.

01:08:14 And actually Barclays, the UK part of the business, did extremely well

01:08:18 yesterday. So things like they're doing better on

01:08:20 being a bit more selective about their lending within this environment where

01:08:23 margins are a bit more under pressure, volumes are a bit more under pressure.

01:08:27 And overall it's just they're kind of waiting, as you kind of allude to, for

01:08:31 those rate cuts to come potentially in the second half of the year.

01:08:33 Okay, Thanks so much, Simon. So from our markets today, we'll get

01:08:36 covering all things UK for you on that blog.

01:08:38 You can find that blog by going to the UK website or you can type to go on to

01:08:42 the Bloomberg terminal. So NatWest, a feature of that

01:08:45 conversation. We need to talk about tech technology as

01:08:47 well. We certainly do.

01:08:51 Strong demand has been cited as a key driver for positive earnings of

01:08:54 Microsoft and Alphabet. The CFOs of both tech giants expressing

01:08:58 optimism in their earnings calls. We are very pleased with our financial

01:09:04 results for the first quarter, driven in particular by strength in search and

01:09:08 cloud, as well as the ongoing efforts to durably re-engineer our cost base.

01:09:13 And in FY 25, that focus on execution should again lead to double digit

01:09:18 revenue and operating income growth to scale to meet the growing demand signal

01:09:23 for our cloud and AI products. We expect 25 capital expenditures to be

01:09:27 higher than in FY 24. For more, let's get to Bloomberg's Alex

01:09:33 Webb, who joins us with the latest on tech.

01:09:34 And we'll throw into the mix darktrace as well, which is another interesting

01:09:38 story this morning. Firstly, on the big US tech names, then

01:09:41 Microsoft and Google. How real is the revolution looking after

01:09:46 these results? I mean, at this stage it's starting to

01:09:47 look pretty real, like a decent chunk and a growing chunk of the growth.

01:09:52 Microsoft Azure in its cloud business is now coming from AI.

01:09:56 That's, you know, a consequence of the massive investments they put into

01:09:59 datacenters that money's obviously been going through and vidya a lot of it on a

01:10:02 Google. The cloud business, which had really

01:10:05 been the laggard behind was Amazon Web Services, that is, and Microsoft Azure,

01:10:11 it is now really starting to make meaningful money for Google.

01:10:15 The expectation of for $600 million or so of profit from the cloud business in

01:10:20 the most recent quarter. In the end it was actually $900 million,

01:10:23 a fairly decent beat as far as the enterprise is concerned.

01:10:26 There seems to be some really adoption Happy went to Darktrace list 2021 not

01:10:31 very long ago. It's not being taken out by Tomer Bravo,

01:10:34 is it? Is it because it's a great business or

01:10:36 because it's very cheap? I'm trying to work out what the answer

01:10:39 is. Well, actually, it's still quite a long

01:10:41 way up on its IPO price. But the thing that I find quite

01:10:44 interesting, it listed in the UK, there is a very simple path that if you're a

01:10:48 private equity firm, then you maybe take that listing in four years time to the

01:10:50 U.S. There was a slight overhang, of course,

01:10:52 for Darktrace that made it harder to listen to us because one of its big

01:10:54 shareholders might Lynch write who is a certain amount of legal difficulty in

01:10:59 the US. Yeah, there was some suspicion that

01:11:01 maybe he didn't want his shareholding to be subject to U.S.

01:11:05 seizures, perhaps if it was listed there.

01:11:07 So by taking it private here, Tim rather considered it for a few years.

01:11:10 They don't spend actually a huge amount on R&D when compared to some of their

01:11:14 peers. Cloudflare has a far higher spend and

01:11:16 R&D spend. Some people therefore suspect that's why

01:11:18 its tech might be a little bit better. They could do that for a few years, take

01:11:21 it public in the U.S. and benefit from the higher multiples of

01:11:25 which U.S. stocks tend to trade a juicy one.

01:11:28 Alex Ward, we thank you so much for walking us through some of the big tech

01:11:30 names. Plus, of course, the IPO story.

01:11:33 We continue the IPO story coming up, a French study by former Bank of France

01:11:37 Governor Christian Noyer calling for urgent action to deepen European capital

01:11:40 markets. That exclusive interview next.

01:11:43 We're going to ask him what he recommends, how they fix the problem,

01:11:46 maybe even his reaction to the fact that one of the biggest private capital deals

01:11:50 this morning are happening in Amsterdam and not Paris.

01:11:54 All that coming up next. This is Bloomberg.

01:12:19 Protests in France last year over pension reform, a political blow for

01:12:23 President Macron. Still rose.

01:12:27 Savings from it were not enough to keep the fiscal deficit under control.

01:12:32 The gap jumped to 5.5% of GDP, far higher than the official target, with

01:12:38 slower growth, meaning lower tax receipts.

01:12:41 The finance minister will have to find at least €20 billion in spending cuts in

01:12:47 the next budget. Hello, Mark.

01:12:48 So now what direction should we take? Restore our public finances.

01:12:52 Go back to a deficit below 3% in 2027. This is the commitment I'm making, a

01:12:59 commitment that's unlikely to be met, according to Moody's.

01:13:03 A year ago, Fitch downgraded France one notch, citing the high level of public

01:13:08 debt, which has jumped from around 65% of GDP 20 years ago to over 110% today.

01:13:15 Should the rating agencies decide to downgrade France?

01:13:18 Of course, that would be something that would not be welcome and that would

01:13:21 prompt certainly the government to try to act on it and to design an

01:13:25 expenditure reduction plan or maybe a new tax increase, which is really

01:13:29 orthogonal to what the government has been saying so far.

01:13:32 The pile of debt risks undermining Merkel's economic credibility and could

01:13:37 fuel support for the far right party of Marine Le Pen.

01:13:42 Her national rally movement is leading Merkel's party in the polls by more than

01:13:47 ten points as the June European election approaches.

01:13:53 Boomer's Caroline Connan reporting there from Paris on France's debt rating and

01:13:57 the political pressure that President Emmanuel Macron is facing as the issues

01:14:01 that Caroline outlined all come amid a push to deepen European capital markets

01:14:05 and meet the massive financing needs over the coming years across the

01:14:08 continent, all to close a widening economic gap with the United States.

01:14:12 Now, how do you do this? Well, in a report released Thursday,

01:14:15 former Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer identified four areas for action

01:14:19 on how to accomplish that. They include developing a bigger

01:14:22 investor base, creating a single EU platform, granting ESMA that fiscal

01:14:26 authority over in the EU more oversight. Despite being based in Paris and

01:14:30 reducing fragmentation across the continent.

01:14:33 Some lofty goals. We'll see how they're executed.

01:14:35 Joining us now for an exclusive interview is Christian Noyer, himself,

01:14:38 the former Bank of France governor and former ECB Governing Council member.

01:14:42 We thank you so much for making the time for us this morning.

01:14:45 Christian, let's start with one of your recommendations here, a number that

01:14:48 caught my eye. €1 trillion of funding needed by 2030.

01:14:53 How realistic is it that we get there? Well, basically.

01:14:58 Well, thank you very much for receiving me.

01:15:00 And good morning to all. We believe that

01:15:05 we can do it. We can do it in the European Union

01:15:08 because we have a very high rate of savings.

01:15:11 And simply, this money is not well enough targeted.

01:15:16 That goes too much into investments abroad and not enough into

01:15:23 equities. So if the investor base is better

01:15:27 reorganized with simple principles, more towards retirement and pension

01:15:35 systems and, you know, new products or more often transformation of existing

01:15:42 products to make them more efficient, we believe we can we can move probably

01:15:49 something like 200 billion a year towards the real needs of the of the

01:15:56 economy. And also we can develop new instruments,

01:16:03 especially securitisation, to

01:16:08 accelerate the rotation in banks balance sheet and permit banks to to lend more

01:16:17 to where it's needed for the transition, the green transition, the digital

01:16:22 transition that is more into the needs of co-operates

01:16:28 equipments and and the infrastructures for energy, for instance.

01:16:35 Christian, a lot of what you're outlining also is similar.

01:16:39 I don't think what you're outlining sounds very similar to the way that the

01:16:42 United States functions, these pension systems, this regulation around savings,

01:16:45 the lending story. A lot of that, however, is regulated and

01:16:49 dictated to some extent by the S.E.C.. I'm curious if we need a European SEC.

01:16:55 Does ESMA serve that purpose? Well, we believe the role of hazmat can

01:17:02 really increase. We have done that in the in the banking

01:17:06 sector for the the monetary union, for the banking union.

01:17:10 We have what we call the single supervisory mechanism that is working

01:17:15 under the umbrella of the ECB. And we believe that the ESMA could

01:17:20 really enhance its role is probably not saying that all the national supervisors

01:17:26 will well disappear. They have not disappeared in the

01:17:29 supervision of the banking sector. But ESMA should really be the the the

01:17:35 the driver, the head of the of the this single supervisory system.

01:17:41 And what we propose is to start with the big

01:17:46 market infrastructures, the cross-border and systemic market

01:17:51 infrastructures. What really doesn't make sense to have a

01:17:55 number of of national regulators. And we also believe that it could

01:18:03 develop its role progressively for the major asset managers.

01:18:08 It would really make sense because the fragmentation of the supervision today

01:18:14 means a lot of costs and inefficiencies. Yeah.

01:18:18 Christine, good morning. Do we also need a mindset shift for

01:18:21 European businesses that have relied for a long time on bank funding rather than

01:18:26 using capital markets? Is that at the heart of the problem?

01:18:30 And that seems to be something that's been discussed for more than a decade.

01:18:35 Well, it's it's true.

01:18:39 It's true globally, although there are differences

01:18:44 between countries. For instance, in France, the share of

01:18:49 market financing is probably close or equivalent to that of the UK.

01:18:54 So it's just not at all the American system, but it's probably

01:18:59 something like the double of what exists in other countries.

01:19:02 Now we're not alone. It's true also in the and the

01:19:05 Netherlands, for instance, so that they are already a premises of

01:19:11 the start of a possible move. But we we believe we can develop that.

01:19:17 It doesn't mean that the role of banks will disappear.

01:19:20 They can arrange structure, securitize part of the loans they do, and then move

01:19:27 that to the market. But yes, it's true in a way, yeah,

01:19:31 we should move towards the model. You described the American model, or at

01:19:36 least be on the way to to change.

01:19:41 Yes. Okay.

01:19:42 So some kind of mindset shift. I mean, you're talking about more union

01:19:45 here, Christine, And this is being, as we say, discussed for many, many years

01:19:48 how you forge more capital markets union.

01:19:51 How do you set that in the context of European politics, where we see the rise

01:19:56 of populist leaders in some places, not everywhere, but certainly in some

01:20:00 places, and the idea of more integration could prove controversial.

01:20:07 Well, I believe that first we we want to to be

01:20:12 very concrete for the ordinary people. I mean, the savers, they are interested

01:20:19 in what they get, the return they get on their savings.

01:20:23 What we propose would be products that would enhance the return that they

01:20:29 receive. And that can be a very, very telling for

01:20:32 for the for the people in general. Second, we think that

01:20:39 we have no choice anyway if we want to finance and to find the money to finance

01:20:46 the big investment costs for the transitions, we need to really move

01:20:51 ahead. This is well understood across all

01:20:54 countries. I think there is a political dynamics in

01:20:58 the sense that we had a few days ago, the report from Enrico Letta,

01:21:04 who is well known and to who produce conclusions shorter than than ours, but

01:21:10 that go in the same direction. And I don't I don't think that this is a

01:21:15 subject that really the populist parties will will want to discuss too much.

01:21:21 They are not so much interested by that. Kristen, good morning.

01:21:26 It's guy. You know, a thing or two about monetary

01:21:28 policy. So let me just get your take on what is

01:21:31 happening. The Federal Reserve increasingly looks

01:21:35 like it may not cut interest rates this year.

01:21:37 How far do you think the ECB can stray and cuts from the Fed?

01:21:44 If if the Fed is basically on hold? Well, I think I mean,

01:21:53 the ECB, as is is in charge of a large enough

01:21:57 monetary union to be to be really independent, so to say on what they

01:22:05 decide. I mean, what they have to do is to look

01:22:08 after the reality of the European economy and target price stability for

01:22:13 the European economy, for the Eurozone economy.

01:22:17 The the things may be different and they seem to be different because the the

01:22:24 growth in the US is more resilient. These there's been in the in the EU or

01:22:31 in the eurozone is stronger. The level of unemployment is lower.

01:22:36 And and it's clear that the need seen from the Fed for from the FOMC may be

01:22:44 different at a certain point of time. So I have no idea or I shouldn't talk

01:22:51 about whether the ECB will do the the the they have to decide that.

01:22:56 But it it's not realistic to believe that they move at different times even

01:23:02 if the general the general movement will probably be going in the same direction.

01:23:09 But there can be a gap of some months or quarters depending on the circumstances

01:23:15 of each economic and monetary resultant. Okay.

01:23:21 That was interesting. Christine, great to catch up with you.

01:23:24 I it's interesting what you're saying about what is happening with Capital

01:23:27 Markets union and the advantages that Europe could face if it were to move

01:23:30 forward with that. I just wonder if the crisis is

01:23:33 sufficient at the moment to make that happen, because, you know, the former

01:23:35 Bank of France governor, former ECB Governing Council member and author of

01:23:39 this report into the Capital Markets Union here in Europe, one example maybe

01:23:44 this morning of things happening in the the capital markets here in Europe, CVC

01:23:49 is listing finally €2 billion. I think this is so fascinating.

01:23:53 This is a private equity firm essentially that is going public at an

01:23:57 IPO
