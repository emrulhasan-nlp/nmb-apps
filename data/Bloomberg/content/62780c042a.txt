00:13 >> I CAN'T REALLY THINK OF A TIME WHEN THERE HAS BEEN QUITE

00:18 THIS MUCH THE VERGENCE. -- THIS MUCH DIVERGENCE.

00:21 >> I THINK WE HAVE BEEN IMPATIENT. THEY ARE COMING.

00:22 THEY ARE HERE.

00:27 >> I WOULD BE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT A DEFLATION SCENARIO IN

00:29 THE U.S. FOR SERVICES.

00:34 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG "SURVEILLANCE"

00:37 WITH TOM KEENE, JONATHAN FERRO, AND LISA ABRAMOWICZ. JONATHAN:

00:44 GOOD MORNING FOR OUR AUDIENCE WORLDWIDE.

00:48 ALONGSIDE TOM KEENE I AM JONATHAN FERRO.

00:51 TAKING OVER FOR THE NEXT TWO HOURS WITH THE WONDERFUL, THE

00:55 BEAUTIFUL, THE MOHAMED EL-ERIAN. TOM:

01:00 BONDS, CURRENCIES, COMMODITIES, AFTER WHAT HAPPENED PRACTICE TO

01:08 RIGHT NOW, DELAYED, THE FANS CANNOT SHOW UP FOR PRACTICE, IT

01:14 IS ALMOST AS BIG OF A MESS AS THE SHORTS CALL ON THE MARKET.

01:21 JONATHAN: WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS

01:23 ALL YEAR. SACRIFICING THE INTEGRITY OF

01:30 THE SPORT FOR COMMERCIAL GAIN CHASING THIS MARKET IN AMERICA.

01:33 TOM: IT IS THE NETFLIX EFFECT. THEY GOT DROWNED BY IT.

01:39 NOW TO GET TO THE SERIOUS STUFF AT HAND, THEY ARE GOING TO DO

01:43 THIS PRACTICE, TRUNCATED NO ONE IN THE STANDS, RIDICULOUS.

01:47 YOU OPEN THE ROADS FOR THE LAS VEGAS COMMUTE, AND THEN THEY

01:50 HAVE THE QUALITIES WHERE THEY FIGURE OUT WHO SITS WHERE IN

01:54 THE RACE AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING. IT IS A BIG SUCCESS.

01:58 LET'S MOVE ON TO WHAT DR. EL-ERIAN CARES ABOUT. JONATHAN:

02:02 WE COULD TALK ABOUT THIS OR SOFT LANDING HOPES AND DREAMS.

02:10 MOHAMED: LET'S TALK ABOUT SOFT LANDING.

02:12 THERE IS BIGGER NEWS, THE OAKLAND A'S ARE MOVING TO LOS

02:16 ANGELES. TOM: IT IS THE CHANGING OF AMERICA.

02:19 THE DEMOCRATIC SKEW. THE BASIC IDEA IS THE

02:23 ATTAINMENT OF THE SOUTH AND THE WEST. YOU LOOK AT THE

02:28 DEMOGRAPHIC STUDIES, LITERALLY TO THE IMPORTANT ECONOMIC

02:33 DEMOGRAPHICS, THE NAMES THAT KEEP COMING UP ARE NASHVILLE,

02:35 AUSTIN, LAS VEGAS, AND OTHERS.

02:36 JONATHAN: I DON'T GET HOW YOU CAN TAKE A

02:40 SPORTING FRANCHISE OUT OF ONE CITY AND TAKE IT TO ANOTHER.

02:44 IN ENGLISH FOOTBALL THAT IS NOT A THING. MOHAMED: MONEY.

02:47 STADIUMS AND MONEY. TOM: THE OWNER OF THE SAN DIEGO

02:53 PADRES DYING OF CANCER, TRAGICALLY, HIS FATHER STARTED

02:56 IT. WALTER O'MALLEY ONE DAY PACKED

02:59 UP THE BROOKLYN DODGERS AND MOVED THEM TO L.A.

03:00 AND THAT IS WHEN IT STARTED. LET'S EMBRACE IT.

03:06 JONATHAN: LET'S TRY TO MOVE ON IN CASE

03:10 PEOPLE GET CONFUSED AND THINK THAT WE TURNED INTO ESPN.

03:15 THE YIELDS ARE LITTLE BIT LOWER, DOWN FOUR BASIS POINTS.

03:18 WE HAVE TO SIT ON CRUDE. THE IDEA THAT CRUDE HAS

03:23 ESSENTIALLY COLLAPSED INTO A BEAR MARKET, DOWN 20% FOR THE

03:28 SEPTEMBER HIGHS, WE HAVE SPENT THIS WEEK TALKING ABOUT SOFT

03:31 LANDING HOPES AND DREAMS. DO WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT AN ECONOMIC

03:33 DOWNTURN IN THE NOT SO DISTANT FUTURE? MOHAMED:

03:38 SOME PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS.

03:40 TO SEE OIL PRICES DOWN MORE THAN 20% FROM THE HIGHS AT A

03:44 TIME THERE IS A CONFLICT IN THE MIDDLE EAST IS QUITE ASTOUNDING.

03:47 THAT IS FEEDING INTO A SOFT LANDING.

03:50 WE ARE GOING TO TALK A LOT ABOUT THIS.

03:52 THE MARKET HAS FULLY EMBRACED NOT JUST THAT THE FED HAS

03:56 FINISHED ITS HIKING CYCLE, WHICH I THINK IS CORRECT, BUT

03:59 THAT WE WILL SEE DEEPER AND DEEPER CUTS NEXT YEAR WITHOUT A

04:01 RECESSION. THAT IS THE CRITICAL ASSUMPTION

04:05 THAT IS NOT BUILT-IN ACROSS MARKETS. TOM:

04:13 AS CEO OF A MAJOR 2 MILLION EMPLOYEE COMPANY IN AMERICA,

04:16 WALMART, BROUGHT UP DEFLATION. SEARED IN THE FABRIC OF

04:19 CAMBRIDGE AND THE LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS, THERE IS THE

04:25 STUDY OF THE BRITISH DEFLATION IN THE 1930'S AND 1940'S.

04:26 AMERICA HAS NEVER FACED IT? MOHAMED: JAPAN HAD IT RECENTLY.

04:32 DEFLATION DISCOURAGES PEOPLE FROM BUYING TODAY.

04:36 FOOD BEING THE PRIMARY EXAMPLE. THAT IS WHY WE RECYCLE IT.

04:42 WE DON'T HAVE GENERAL DEFLATION AND I DOUBT WE WILL HAVE

04:43 GENERAL DEFLATION.

04:44 TOM: THE GENERAL DEFLATION QUESTION

04:49 IS A VECTOR OF DISINFLATION IN PLACE. CLEARLY, WE SEE THAT.

04:53 WHAT IS YOUR OPTIMISM OF GETTING BACK TO JOHN WILLIAMS

04:57 2.0% OR RICHARD CLARIDA'S TWO-POINT X PERCENT?

05:04 MOHAMED: I THINK WE WILL BE STUCK IN THE

05:08 HIGH TWO'S AND THE FED WILL HAVE TO DECIDE IF IT LIVES WITH

05:11 INFLATION HIGHER THAN TARGET BECAUSE THE TARGET IS TOO LOW,

05:17 OR DOES IT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT 2% IS THE RIGHT TARGET AND CRASHES

05:20 THE ECONOMY? JONATHAN: WHAT IS YOUR BEST GUESS?

05:25 MOHAMED: I THINK IT WILL GO FOR THE

05:27 FORMER. THE FED WILL UNDERSTAND THAT

05:30 PRESSING 2% INFLATION IN A WORLD WHERE THERE IS

05:33 INSUFFICIENT STRUCTURAL SUPPLIES IN THE RIGHT THING TO

05:35 DO. JONATHAN: WHERE DO YOU THINK IT LEAVES

05:38 THIS BOND MARKET? A TWO-YEAR AT 480, 10 YEAR AT

05:41 440. THINK ABOUT WHERE WE'VE BEEN IN

05:43 THE LAST MONTH OR SO.

05:51 10-YEAR THROUGH 5%, HIGH OF THE CYCLE.

05:54 HOW DO YOU THINK WE WILL COME BACK DOWN TO BEARING IN MIND

05:56 WE'LL WILL BE PRICING FOR RATE CUTS NEXT YEAR? MOHAMED:

06:01 I THINK WE HAVE COME DOWN TOO FAR.

06:03 I UNDERSTAND WHY SOME THINK WE ARE GOING FURTHER BUT IF YOU

06:04 LOOK AT THE INFLATION DYNAMICS THAT'S HARDER TO GET UNLESS WE

06:08 GO INTO A RECESSION. IF WE GO INTO THE RECESSION THE

06:12 STOCK MARKET WILL SPIKE. YOU CAN'T HAVE BOTH AT THE SAME

06:18 TIME. JONATHAN:

06:19 HAS SOMETHING CHANGED POSTTEST -- POST-PANDEMIC?

06:22 WHERE DO YOU COME DOWN ON IT? MOHAMED:

06:26 I THINK THAT THE PRE-PANDEMIC WORLD WAS EXCEPTIONAL, A WORLD

06:30 OF QE AND INSUFFICIENT AGGREGATE DEMAND.

06:33 WHEN YOU HAVE INSUFFICIENT AGGREGATE DEMAND YOU CAN PUSH

06:36 INTO THE ECONOMY AS MUCH LIQUIDITY AS YOU WANT BECAUSE

06:38 YOU WON'T HAVE INFLATION. WE ARE NOW IN A WORLD OF

06:42 INFLEXIBLE SUPPLY, AND THAT IS A VERY DIFFERENT WORLD. TOM:

06:47 GROWTH ECONOMICS. I HAVE BEEN TELLING PEOPLE TO

06:53 REMIND THEMSELVES OF A GUY AT M.I.T.

06:54 IN 1956 AND THE NEAR RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE OF TRUSTING AND

06:57 GROWTH. CAN YOU STATE THAT WE HAVE A

07:00 NEW AMERICAN GROWTH ECONOMICS AWFUL FOOT SOME PEOPLE ARE

07:04 INDICATING IS IMPROVED PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY?

07:06 MOHAMED: I LISTEN CAREFULLY TO OUR

07:12 FRIEND MIKE SPENCE, THE NOBEL PRIZE WINNER. TOM:

07:16 STUDYING WITH JOHN HICKS. THE MAJESTY OF THAT ALONE.

07:19 MOHAMED: HE IS INCREDIBLE. HIS INSIGHTS ARE INVALUABLE.

07:26 HIS BOTTOM LINE IS MOST COUNTRIES HAVE TO EVOLVE TO A

07:29 NEW GROWTH MODEL IN THE U.S. IS THE MOST ADVANCED IN THAT

07:31 EVOLUTION. THREE IMPORTANT PIECES OF

07:35 LEGISLATION WERE CRITICAL. IF YOU LOOK AROUND THE WORLD,

07:41 THE U.S., EUROPE, OR CHINA, ALL THREE HAVE THE CHALLENGE OF

07:44 EVOLVING THEIR GROWTH MODEL AND ONLY THE U.S.

07:47 IS DOING IT SERIOUSLY RIGHT NOW. TOM: ARE WE TOO GLOOMY? MOHAMED:

07:51 NO, WE ARE NOT TOO GLOOMY. I THINK THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT

07:56 THE WORLD IS EVOLVING. THIS IS A DIFFERENT GLOBAL AND

07:59 DOMESTIC ECONOMY AND POLICIES HAVE TO EVOLVE ACCORDINGLY.

08:02 JONATHAN: WHAT WORRIES MAN CONCERNS A LOT

08:06 OF PEOPLE IS YOU HAVE TO GO BACK 48 HOURS AND WE ARE

08:08 TALKING ABOUT DISINFLATION, SOFT LANDING HOPES AND DREAMS.

08:14 48 HOURS LATER YOU LOOK TO BURBERRY, A COLLAPSE IN LUXURY.

08:18 WALMART, A WARNING ABOUT THE U.S. CONSUMER.

08:21 CRUDE ENTERING A BEAR MARKET. ALL OF A SUDDEN WE ARE TALKING

08:23 ABOUT A SLOWDOWN AND EVEN RECESSION.

08:26 THE BOND MARKET IS STUCK BETWEEN THIS WITH DOUBLE-DIGIT

08:29 MOVES DAY AFTER DAY IN EITHER DIRECTION.

08:31 YOU HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT THIS EXTENSIVELY IN THE LAST FEW

08:34 MONTHS ABOUT A BOND MARKET THAT HAS LOST ITS ANCHORS.

08:37 IS AN ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN SUFFICIENT TO REGAIN IN

08:39 TREASURY SPECIFICALLY? MOHAMED: NO. YESTERDAY I WAS WATCHING YOU

08:45 WHEN YOU SAID, GUESS WHAT, WE ARE AT THE SAME LEVEL OF THE 10

08:48 YEAR AS A WEEK AGO. MY REACTION IS, HOW CAN THAT BE?

08:52 YOU WERE RIGHT. MOST PEOPLE FEEL THAT THIS WEEK

08:54 IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM LAST WEEK.

08:56 BECAUSE OF THE INFLATION PRINT THAT WE'VE HAD.

09:02 WE STILL LACK ONE OF THE THREE ANCHORS.

09:05 YOU EITHER NEED AN ECONOMIC ANCHOR OR A POLICY ANCHOR OR A

09:07 TECHNICAL ANCHOR TO THE BOND MARKET. WE HAVE LOST ALL THREE.

09:12 THESE MOVES ARE GOING TO CONTINUE.

09:13 THE THING THAT'S REALLY IMPRESSED ME IS THAT NOTHING IS

09:15 BROKEN. IF YOU HAD TOLD ME A YEAR AGO

09:18 THAT WE WOULD SEE THIS INCREDIBLE VOLATILITY IN THE

09:23 MOST IMPORTANT MARKET IN THE WORLD, THE BENCHMARK FOR SO

09:25 MUCH ELSE AND NOTHING WOULD BREAK, I WOULD TELL YOU THAT'S

09:27 IMPOSSIBLE. THE RESILIENCE OF THE

09:29 FUNCTIONING OF THE MARKET HAS IMPRESSED ME. TOM:

09:35 THE FINANCIAL MARKET, AND THE SHOCK AND THE UNITED KINGDOM

09:38 OFF DERIVATIVE STRUCTURE AND PENSION PLANS, BUT THE LEADER

09:41 IN STANDARD DEVIATIONS, WHICH IS HOW FANCY PEOPLE LIKE AL

09:44 ARIAN THINK, WE HAVE SIX STANDARD DEVIATION END OF THE

09:46 GREAT MODERATION. THERE IS A HOPE AND PRAYER THAT

09:51 WE GET BACK TO THE TRENDLINE IN YEARS.

09:52 HOW MANY YEARS OUT DO THINK THAT WE HEAL THIS GREAT BONDED

09:54 DEBACLE? MOHAMED: I THINK IT WILL TAKE TIME.

09:57 WE HAD 10 EXCEPTIONAL YEARS WHERE THE BOND MARKET WAS

10:01 DISTORTED. TOM: ALMOST BACK TO VOLKER WHERE WE

10:05 HAD 30 EXCEPTIONAL YEARS.

10:11 MOHAMED: THE SHIFT TO AN ARTIFICIALLY

10:12 LOW INTEREST RATE AND PREDICTABLE INJECTIONS OF

10:15 LIQUIDITY FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED THE BOND MARKET.

10:17 THAT WILL TAKE TIME TO RECOVER FROM. TOM:

10:21 DID YOU AND BILL GROSS GET A FREE RIDE BECAUSE YOU WERE IN

10:23 THE GREAT MODERATION? WAS THAT SUCH A STRUCTURAL --

10:26 MOHAMED: I'M NOT SURE THAT IT FELT LIKE

10:28 A FREE RIDE AT THE TIME. TOM: PIMCO, WHEN YOU INVENTED IT

10:32 WITH BILL, WAS IT EASIER BECAUSE YOU HAD THE GREAT

10:33 MODERATION?

10:34 MOHAMED: INVESTORS CARE ABOUT THREE

10:39 THINGS. RETURNS, VOLATILITY, AND CORRELATIONS.

10:44 WE WENT THROUGH A TIME THAT BECAUSE LIQUIDITY WAS BEING

10:48 INJECTED INTO THE ECONOMY OVER AND OVER, WE GOT HIGH RETURNS,

10:52 VIRTUALLY NO VOLATILITY, AND THE CORRELATIONS BROKE DOWN IN

10:54 YOUR FAVOR. YOU MADE MONEY ON YOUR RISKY

10:56 AND RISK-FREE ASSETS AT THE SAME TIME.

11:01 IT WAS A GREAT TIME AND WE TOOK IT TO BE NORMAL, BUT IT WAS

11:03 EXCEPTIONAL. WE ARE GOING BACK TO A WORLD

11:06 THAT WAS MORE LIKE WHAT WE HAD BEFORE THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL

11:07 CRISIS. JONATHAN: IT WILL BE HARD TO SHAKE THIS

11:13 BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD A COUPLE OF GENERATIONS CONDITIONED BY TWO

11:16 MAJOR SHOCKS. THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND

11:18 PANDEMIC. WE KNOW HOW THE FED RESPONSE TO

11:21 MAJOR SHOCKS. WHAT WE HAVE FORGOTTEN IS HOW

11:25 IT RESPONDS TO NORMAL ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS AND UPSIDES ON

11:27 INFLATION. MOHAMED:

11:33 JON, IT IS STRIKING THAT THE MARKET IS WILLING TO TAKE ON

11:36 THE FED ON A PRICE THAT THE FED CONTROLS.

11:40 THE FED TOTALLY CONTROLS THE POLICY RATE, AND YET THE MARKET

11:44 DOESN'T BELIEVE WHAT THE FED IS TELLING US.

11:49 IT'S REALLY STRIKING, BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TO, RESTORE FED

11:52 CREDIBILITY OTHERWISE WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE WITH THIS

11:56 ENORMOUS VOLATILITY. TOM: YOUR THOUGHTS PERCOLATING INTO

12:00 THE END OF THE YEAR INTO Q1 2020 FOUR, ARE THERE SHADOWS IN

12:01 PRIVATE EQUITY? ARE THERE SHADOWS IN THE NEW

12:05 NONTRADITIONAL FINANCE? MOHAMED: ONE THING THAT I DON'T THINK

12:09 HIS PRICED AND ENOUGH IS WHEN YOU MOVE FROM THE BANKING

12:15 SYSTEM TO THE NONBANKS, YOU CHANGE THE LAGS IN THE SYSTEM.

12:18 WE SEE THIS WITH COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE.

12:23 EVERYONE RECOGNIZES THAT THE REFINANCING OF ONE TRILLION

12:26 PLUS ASSETS IS GOING TO BE TRICKY.

12:30 BECAUSE IT IS OVER TIME, WE DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

12:33 EVERYONE RECOGNIZES IT, BUT BECAUSE IT'S OVER TIME WE DON'T

12:35 WORRY ABOUT IT. IF IT WERE ALL WITHIN THE

12:40 BANKING SYSTEM WE WOULD HAVE WORRIED QUICKLY.

12:43 THE MOVE FROM BANKS TO NONBANKS HAS EXTENDED -- TOM:

12:48 THIS IS A MICHAEL SPENCE ISSUE? THE REGULATORY LAG?

12:55 JONATHAN: THIS MATURITY WALL IS OUT THERE

12:56 IN 2025 AND THERE IS THE FEELING WE WILL HAVE TO THINK

12:58 ABOUT IT. AT SOME POINT WE HAVE TO START

13:01 THINKING ABOUT IT? MOHAMED: YOU ENJOY THE JOURNEY BEFORE

13:05 YOU GET TO THE DESTINATION. TOM: ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE US GOOD

13:08 NEWS, BAD NEWS? MOHAMED: MOMENTUM IS IMPORTANT AND YOU

13:15 WANT TO BE EXPOSED TO THIS MARKET.

13:18 MORE PEOPLE HAVE A TACTICAL MINDSET THAN A STRATEGIC OR

13:19 STRUCTURAL MINDSET. INVESTMENT HAS BECOME VERY

13:22 TECHNICAL. JONATHAN: IT IS GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US.

13:29 FOR THE NEXT TWO HOURS, A FANTASTIC LINEUP OF GUESTS.

13:35 WE WILL CHECK UP WITH A FEDERATED OR. TONS OF FED SPEAK.

13:40 WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO LEARN TODAY GOING INTO THE WEEKEND?

13:44 TOM: TO SPEAK LESS WOULD BE HELPFUL.

13:49 AUSTAN GOOLSBEE I THINK IS FASCINATING BECAUSE HE COMES

13:56 FROM THE CHICAGO SOCIAL SCIENCE BEHAVIOR NEXIS AND IS TUNED TO

13:59 THE RAMIFICATIONS OF POLICY MORE THAN OTHERS. JONATHAN:

14:04 IN THE FINANCIAL TIMES, "IT'S TOO EARLY TO DECLARE VICTORY."

14:08 TOM: HER LIFE STORY MAKES HER A GOOD

14:09 FED PRESIDENT. JONATHAN: TRYING TO GET YOU TOWARDS THE

14:15 WEEKEND, TOWARDS A THIRD WEEK OF GAINS ON THE S&P.

14:19 YIELDS LOWER BY FOUR OR FIVE BASIS POINTS.

14:24 IT IS A BREAK OF 4.40 ON THE 10 YEAR. YIELD THIS MORNING, 4.38.

14:30 FROM NEW YORK, GOOD MORNING.

14:46 >> WE STILL DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO GET

14:49 INFLATION DOWN TO 2%, SO I THINK THAT THE DEGREE OF

14:53 UNCERTAINTY AND RISK IS LESS TODAY THAN 18 MONTHS AGO, BUT

14:58 THERE IS STILL A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHETHER THE

15:04 FED IS DONE. JONATHAN:

15:06 BILL DUDLEY ON THE SITUATION IN THE MARKET.

15:07 FIXED INCOME, HOPES AND DREAMS OF A SOFT LANDING AND WITHOUT

15:14 THE PAIN OF HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT. EVERYONE SAYING THE SAME THING,

15:18 IT IS TOO PREMATURE TO MAKE THAT CALL NOW, THAT DECLARATION

15:20 OF VICTORY OVER INFLATION. TOM: THE TRANSITORY THING IS

15:24 TENTATIVE AND OTHER THINGS ARE TENTATIVE.

15:29 THERE IS A NEW KIND OF DATA-DEPENDENT.

15:33 I CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH THE NATURE.

15:40 I AM FOCUSED ON JAPAN, THE EURO-YEN, BUT THE ANSWERS ARE

15:43 SLAVES TO DATA DEPENDENCY. AFTER THE WEEK THAT WE'VE HAD,

15:47 THE NEW ATTENTION TO DATA DEPENDENCY HAS INCREASED.

15:50 JONATHAN: GOOD MORNING. EQUITY FUTURES ON THE S&P ARE

15:55 POSITIVE AGAIN. THREE DAYS ON THE S&P 500.

16:00 ANOTHER LIFT UP BY 0.2%, POTENTIALLY A THIRD WEEK OF

16:06 GAINS INTO THE WEEKEND.

16:09 THE EURO IS STRONGER AGAIN, 108. 71 AGAINST THE DOLLAR.

16:15 THIS HAS BEEN THE SURPRISE SINCE OCTOBER.

16:17 WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT TRIPLE DIGIT CRUDE, BANK IN A BEAR

16:19 MARKET ON CRUDE. IT IS A SHOCKER OVER THE LAST

16:21 SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS. TOM: EDWARD MORRIS OF CITIGROUP,

16:28 ABSOLUTELY NAILED IT. IT WAS AS LONELY A CALL AS

16:36 DUDLEY AND ELLEN ARIAN -- AS DUDLEY AND MOHAMED EL-ERIAN.

16:42 JONATHAN: YOUR GOOD FRIEND ON THE ENERGY

16:46 DESK, WE COULD SEE OPEC PLUS TWO SIZABLE CUTS FROM HERE.

16:49 I THINK THAT IT'S MORE LIKELY THEY WANT TO STABILIZE THEM

16:53 AMONG THEIR OPEC PEERS A COLLECTIVE CUT RATHER THAN ONE

16:56 ON THEIR OWN TO GET AHEAD OF THE ECONOMIC WEAKNESS GOING

16:57 INTO NEXT YEAR. TOM: IN THE NEXT HOUR, LOOKING FOR

17:01 E.M. EXPANSION TO BOOST DEMAND.

17:04 FOR WHATEVER REASONS, I'M NOT FAULTING THEM, BUT IT HASN'T

17:10 HAPPENED. THAT'S THE JP MORGAN READJUSTMENT.

17:14 JONATHAN: WTI IS THREATENING TO BREAK

17:15 INTO THE 60'S. TOM: MOHAMED EL-ERIAN IS WITH US AND

17:20 IT'S A GREAT THRILL. HE IS AT QUEENS COLLEGE IN

17:25 CAMBRIDGE AND IS INTERESTED IN THE ASSET ALLOCATION OF THEIR

17:28 ENDOWMENT. STEVE SHARON HAD MULTI-ASSET

17:30 SOLUTIONS. STEVE, THIS IS A LONELY BULL

17:33 MARKET. HOW DO YOU REALLOCATE INTO THE

17:36 END OF THE YEAR? STEVE: YOU HAD TO GET AHEAD OF IT A

17:39 LITTLE BIT. WE WERE ADDING OVER THE COURSE

17:44 OF THE SUMMER WHEN IT WAS UNCOMFORTABLE ON THE IDEA THAT

17:48 MARKETS LIKE FED PAUSES AND THEY PRICE IN SOFT LANDINGS.

17:52 EVEN IF THE SOFT LANDING DOES NOT MATERIALIZE.

17:55 WHEN THE FED PAUSES, INVARIABLY, IT IS ON SUSPICION

18:00 THEY'VE GONE TOO FAR AND NOT CONFIRMATION.

18:02 THE DATA AVAILABLE TO YOU IS A FED THAT IS NO LONGER HIKING

18:04 AND AN EMPLOYMENT -- UNEMPLOYMENT W RATE THAT IS STI

18:09 LOW. WITH THE BOND MARKET HAVING BROKEN, WE ARE GETTING THE FED

18:16 PAUSE RALLY, AND THAT CAN BE POWERFUL. HISTORICALLY THOSE ARE

18:18 NINE-MONTH EVENTS. YOU CAN SEE THE EQUITY MARKET

18:22 UP 15%-20%. INTERESTINGLY, THE EQUITY

18:27 MARKET HAS HIT AN ALL-TIME HIGH EACH OF THE LAST FIVE TIMES

18:30 THAT THE FED HAS PAUSED. FOUR OF THOSE ENDED IN TEARS,

18:34 BUT IT HAPPENED EITHER WAY. WE THINK THAT THIS RALLY HAS

18:36 LEGS. THE JURY ON WHETHER OR NOT HOW

18:40 SOFT THIS LANDING IS NEXT YEAR IS VERY MUCH OUT, BUT FOR THE

18:43 TIME BEING WE THINK THIS RALLY CONTINUES. MOHAMED:

18:47 WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT TO DETERMINE THE MACRO QUESTION OF

18:52 HAS THE FED NOT JUST PAUSED BUT WILL START CUTTING?

18:55 CAN IT DO SO WITHIN A SOFT LANDING?

18:58 WHAT ARE THE KEY VARIABLES WE LOOK AT? STEVE:

19:01 WE ARE CALLING THEM THE FIVE GAMES OF CHICKEN.

19:03 IT IS THAT CORPORATE REFINANCING LAW.

19:08 YOU WILL HAVE 60% OF CORPORATE DEBT COME DUE BETWEEN 24 AND

19:23 28. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THAT WILL FACE MATERIALLY HIGHER RATES

19:25 AND WHAT DOES THAT DUE TO COMPANY EARNINGS?

19:26 NUMBER TWO, SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE ALREADY SEEN THEIR DEBT

19:28 REPRICED. HOW MANY QUARTERS OF HIGH RATES

19:29 CAN THEY SURVIVE? ON THE CONSUMER, REAL INCOME

19:31 GROWTH HAS FINALLY TURNED POSITIVE, BUT HOW POSITIVE DOES

19:33 IT GET AND DOES IT ALLOW THE CONSUMER TO DE-LEVER AND

19:37 CONTINUE TO SPEND? 800 $77 OF BANK DEPOSIT

19:42 OUTFLOW, WHAT DOES THAT DO TO RESTRICT

19:45 LENDING?THE FEDERAL DEBT, ONE THIRD OF WHICH BECOMES DUE THIS

19:49 YEAR, RE-PRICES TO A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER RATE.

19:53 THOSE FIVE THINGS, IF THEY WERE TO ALL GO PERFECTLY YOU WOULD

19:57 GET THIS IMMACULATE SOFT LANDING, BUT WE THINK IT IS

19:59 UNLIKELY. WHAT IS MORE LIKELY IS A ROCKY

20:03 LANDING WHERE INFLATION IS STUCK AT 3%, SOME RATES ARE

20:06 HIGH, THERE IS A SLOW DOWN AND IT IS A SINGLE DIGIT EQUITY

20:09 ENVIRONMENT. THERE IS A REAL RISK THAT

20:13 SOMETHING BREAKS AND YOU GET A CLASSIC RECESSION.

20:17 BETWEEN THE ROCKY LANDING AND CLASSIC RECESSION BREAK THAT WE

20:20 THINK IS MOST LIKELY TO HAPPEN, WE ARE IN THE ROCKY LANDING

20:21 CAMP FOR NOW. MOHAMED:

20:27 YOUR FIVE FACTORS, IT IS ALL ABOUT SUPPLY, IT IS ALL ABOUT

20:29 WHO WAS GOING TO BUY ALL OF THE SUPPLY?

20:33 STEVE: I THINK WHERE I WOULD FOCUS

20:37 MORE ACUTELY IS ON THE NEXUS BETWEEN BANKS AND SMALL

20:42 BUSINESSES.

20:43 THE BANKS, IF THERE ARE 877 BILLION DOLLARS LESS IN

20:47 DEPOSITS, THAT IS $877 BILLION LESS IN LOANS THAT CAN BE MADE.

20:51 SMALL BUSINESSES ARE NOT FACING THE MATURITY WALL.

20:54 THEY HAVE ALREADY SEEN IT. IF SOMETHING WERE TO BREAK WE

20:56 WOULD LOOK THERE SO WE ARE SPENDING A LOT OF TIME FOCUSING

21:01 THERE, AND ALSO LARGER CAP COMPANIES IN OUR ASSET

21:06 ALLOCATION. JONATHAN: IT CAME FROM THE WALMART CEO,

21:10 WE MAY BE MANAGING THROUGH A TIME OF DEFLATION IN THE MONTHS

21:11 TO COME. WHEN YOU HEARD THOSE WORDS,

21:14 WHAT WAS YOUR RESPONSE? STEVE: I THINK THAT THE WORD DEFLATION

21:19 IS STRONG, BUT I THINK THERE COULD BE MORE DISINFLATION THAN

21:22 WE ARE EXPECTING. IF YOU LOOK AT THE AREAS IN THE

21:26 ECONOMY WHERE YOU HAVE SEEN DISINFLATION SO FAR, IT IS

21:31 GOODS PRICES, FOOD PRICES, ENERGY PRICES.

21:33 A LOT OF STUFF THAT CAN BE EXPLAINED BY COVID

21:38 NORMALIZATION. INTEREST-RATE SENSITIVE

21:40 PURCHASES HAVE NOT SEEN THE BIG DEFLATION THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT.

21:43 HOME PRICES ARE STILL RELATIVELY BUOYANT.

21:48 TRY TO BUY A CAR, IT IS NOT EXACTLY A VALUE EXERCISE THESE

21:49 DAYS. THROUGH THE ECONOMY, THERE IS

21:54 MORE DISINFLATION IN THE PIPELINE AND YOU COULD SEE THE

22:00 FED IN SOME POINT IN 2024 GO VERY QUICKLY FROM WORRYING

22:03 PRIMARILY ABOUT INFLATION TO WORRYING VERY MUCH ABOUT GROWTH

22:08 IN THE EMPLOYMENT MARKETS. THAT COULD SWITCH ON A DIME AND

22:09 IT IS SOMETHING THAT KEEPS US IN A HUMBLE POSITION. JONATHAN:

22:13 IS THE SAME TRUE FOR INVESTORS? YOU MENTIONED THE FEDERAL

22:16 RESERVE CAN MAKE THAT SWITCH. I WONDER HOW QUICKLY INVESTORS

22:20 START TO MAKE THAT SWITCH AND IF WE CAN GET THE VIRGINS

22:22 BETWEEN WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH BONDS AND STOCKS? STEVE:

22:27 I THINK WHAT YOU DO IS YOU PULL UP CHARTS AND YOU LOOK AT THEM

22:28 HISTORICALLY.

22:34 UNEMPLOYMENT TAKES STAIRS DOWN AND ELEVATORS UP.

22:39 EQUITY MARKET STAIRS DOWN AND ELEVATORS UP.

22:41 IF YOU'RE HEADED TOWARDS A RECESSION YOU DON'T GRADUALLY

22:44 SHIFT YOUR VIEW IN THE LATE PART OF THE CYCLE.

22:47 IT HAPPENS VERY SWIFTLY. THAT IS WHY AS AN INVESTOR YOU

22:50 HAVE TO PREPARE AND YOU START TO LENGTHEN DURATION AND

22:51 UPGRADE THE QUALITY OF YOUR EQUITIES.

22:53 WE LIKE COMPANIES WITH STRONG BALANCE SHEETS AND CASH FLOW

22:57 GENERATION AND LOW EXTERNAL FINANCING.

23:00 YOU MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION SO THAT IF IT MOVES ON A DIME,

23:03 WHICH HISTORICALLY IT DOES COME YOU AREN'T LEFT OUT IN THE COLD.

23:08 JONATHAN: HAVE A GOOD WEEKEND. ONE OF MY FAVORITE NOTES COMES

23:15 OUT WEEKLY ON FRIDAY MORNING FROM BANK OF AMERICA, HE HAD

23:17 THIS TO SAY. ESSENTIALLY, LOWER YIELDS ARE

23:20 GOOD FOR RISK ASSETS UNTIL THEY ARE NOT.

23:27 5% TO 4% BOND YIELDS, BULLISH RISK, EASY FINANCIAL CONDITIONS.

23:30 FOR PERCENT TO 3%, DIFFERENT WORLD. BEARISH RISK, WE WILL BE

23:32 TALKING ABOUT RECESSION. MOHAMED:

23:36 I THINK THAT THAT'S A REALLY GOOD WAY.

23:37 WE AGREE ON THE EFFECTS OF

23:43 LOWER YIELDS AND OIL PRICES. IF YOU SEE RATES COME DOWN TOO

23:46 RAPIDLY THE MARKET IS PRICING IN A MAJOR SLOW DOWN AND THAT

23:48 IS NOT GOOD FOR RISK ASSETS. TOM:

23:58 2009, A CHAPTER ON MICHAEL AT CREDIT SUISSE.

24:01 HE WROTE AN ESSAY 20 PLUS YEARS AGO ON THE CONCENTRATION OF

24:05 TECHNOLOGY, THE CONCENTRATION OF RETURN IN CAPITALISM.

24:07 IS THAT WHERE WE ARE? WE WILL COME BACK AND TALK

24:10 ABOUT THIS. IT IS IMPORTANT. ARE WE GOING TO SEE A

24:16 CONTINUATION OF THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN? JONATHAN:

24:20 I THINK IT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION GOING INTO

24:22 NEXT YEAR FOR THE STOCK MARKET GIVEN THE SURPRISE WE'VE HAD

24:25 THIS YEAR. THEY DOMINATED IN A WAY THAT

24:26 WAS UNEXPECTED FOR MANY.

24:46 JONATHAN: THREE DAYS OF GAINS ON THE S&P

24:49 500. FUTURES LOOK LIKE THIS ON THE

24:53 S&P, THE NASDAQ, THE RUSSELL, THE SMALL CAPS ALL OVER THE

24:57 PLACE UP BY 1.3% THIS YEAR THE S&P UP BY 0.2%.

25:01 A POSITIVE WEEK OF GAINS BY MORE THAN 2% CURRENTLY THROUGH

25:05 THE CLOSE ON THURSDAY. THREE WEEKS OF GAINS ON THE S&P

25:11 500 WOULD BE THE LONGEST WEEKLY STREAK SINCE THE END OF JULY.

25:14 YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT BIG TECH AND THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN,

25:17 GOLDMAN SACHS, THIS IS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY.

25:22 THE MAGNIFICENT PERFORMANCE OF THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN HAS BEEN

25:24 A DEFINING FEATURE OF THE EQUITY MARKET IN 2023, THE

25:28 STOCK SHOULD COLLECTIVELY OUTPERFORM THE REMAINDER OF THE

25:31 INDEX IN 2024 THIS IS SOMETHING YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT A MILLION

25:33 TIMES. HIGHER MARGINS, GREATER REINVESTMENT RATIO, STRONGER

25:36 BALANCE SHEETS. TOM: I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING THIS

25:43 IN NOVEMBER, I DON'T HAVE A CONCEPT FOR NEXT YEAR.

25:48 I AM 99% CERTAIN IT WILL BE THE PROBABILISTIC NARROWNESS OF THE

25:50 STREET AND THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN WILL CONTINUE TO DOMINATE.

25:55 MANY PEOPLE SAY IT WILL BE THIS OR THAT, AND I'M SAYING

25:57 POSSIBLY BALONEY. I AM NOT THERE YET.

25:59 I AM DISTRACTED. JONATHAN: I AM DISTRACTED TOO.

26:05 THE BOND MARKET, IT LOOKS LIKE THIS. IT IS AMAZING TO SEE THE

26:09 10-YEAR HERE, IT IS NOT A TYPO. IT IS A BREAK OF 4.40.

26:17 MOHAMED 4.3946, DOWN FOR BASIS POINTS.

26:22 IT FEELS LIKE A NORMAL SNOOZE DAY DOWN FIVE BASIS POINTS.

26:26 MOHAMED: IT HAS BEEN INCREDIBLE. WE HAVE HAD 10 BASIS POINTS

26:30 MOVE UP AND DOWN AND IT HAS BEEN THIS AMAZING VOLATILITY

26:32 FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT MARKET IN THE GLOBAL SYSTEM. JONATHAN:

26:36 IT FEELS LIKE A PENNY STOCK SOME DAYS.

26:40 VERY LITTLE INFORMATION. THINK ABOUT TUESDAY, THE

26:46 TINIEST DOWNSIZE AND WE ARE MOVING 20 BASIS POINTS ACROSS

26:50 THE CURVE.

26:52 TOM: THE 10 YEAR YIELD 2.15%, TWO

26:57 STANDARD DEVIATIONS MOVE, THE 2.07.

27:01 THE 10 YEAR INFLATION IS JUST YIELD BREAK BELOW 2.07%, WHAT

27:06 QUALITY OF DISINFLATION/DEFLATION DOES

27:07 THAT SIGNAL AND WEAKER DEMAND?

27:10 JONATHAN: LET'S TURN TO OUR TOP STORIES.

27:14 PRESIDENT BIDEN SIGNING A STOPGAP BILL TO EXPAND

27:18 GOVERNMENT FUNDING INTO EARLY 2024, VOIDING A GOVERNMENT

27:22 SHUTDOWN FOR NOW, DESPITE THE AGREEMENT BOTH SIDES REMAIN

27:26 DIVIDED ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES, INCLUDING UKRAINE, ISRAEL AID,

27:27 AND IMMIGRATION. THE MESSAGE EXTENDING TWO

27:31 FUNDING DEADLINES. JANUARY 19, FEBRUARY 2.

27:35 THE SHOW DOWN ON THE HORIZON, THE MOTHER OF ALL ARGUMENTS,

27:41 OVERSPENDING? MOHAMED: ABSOLUTELY.

27:42 THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WE FIND A WAY TO KICK THE BALL, AND

27:44 THAT'S FINE. JONATHAN: KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD.

27:50 TOM: SHORT RADIO ANSWERS. MOHAMED:

27:57 WITH THE PRESENCE OF THE TWO OF YOU, PEOPLE WOULD RATHER LISTEN

27:59 TO THE TWO OF YOU THAN TO ME. I AM JUST A TRANSITION.

28:01 JONATHAN: I THINK THAT T.K. IS DISTRACTING YOU.

28:09 TOM: THE IMPORTANT STUFF HERE, JANUARY, WE GET THROUGH THE

28:14 HOLIDAYS, DO YOU TAKE THE FIGTREE DOWN? JONATHAN:

28:18 I TAKE THE FAKE TREE DOWN THE FIRST WEEK OF JANUARY.

28:19 AFTER MY BIRTHDAY THE NEW YEAR. TOM:

28:24 A FAKE TREE AND THEN ANOTHER SHUT DOWN. MOHAMED:

28:27 WHERE DOES THE FIGTREE GO? JONATHAN: IN THE LIVING ROOM.

28:30 MOHAMED: ONCE YOU TAKE IT DOWN? JONATHAN:

28:36 IN STORAGE IN THE CLOAK ROOM BY THE FRONT DOOR IN THE CUPBOARD.

28:40 IT IS THE ONE COVERED THAT WE HAVE. TOM:

28:44 DOES IT HAVE LIGHTS OR NO LIGHTS? JONATHAN: IT HAS LIGHTS.

28:47 IT HAS LIGHTS. TOM:

28:53 RED AND BLACK QUE? JONATHAN: CLEAR, BUILT IN LIGHTS.

29:02 YOU ARE SO JEALOUS OF MY TREE, EVERY YEAR.

29:04 I WILL SHARE A PICTURE. HE HAS TREE ENVY. TOM:

29:10 THE UGLY LIGHTS LIKE BILL GROSS HAS. JONATHAN:

29:16 THAT IS ALL I EXPECT FROM YOU. GO HOME AND THE TREE SITS IN

29:20 THE CORNER AND IT DOESN'T GET DECORATED UNTIL CHRISTMAS EVE.

29:22 LET'S GET TO THIS STORY AND MOVE ON.

29:28 CHINESE PRESIDENT XI JINPING SAYING THAT HE WILL TAKE

29:34 HEARTWARMING STEPS, AN ACTUAL QUOTE, TO ATTRACT FOREIGN

29:37 CAPITAL AND CREATE A WORLD-CLASS BUSINESS

29:38 ENVIRONMENT. IN A WRITTEN SPEECH IN

29:42 CALIFORNIA, WE WILL ALSO TAKE MORE HEARTWARMING MEASURES,

29:45 SUCH AS IMPROVING THE POLICIES ON ENTRY AND STAY OF FOREIGN

29:48 NATIONALS IN CHINA. ALL OF THIS IS DESIGNED TO MAKE

29:52 IT EASIER FOR FOREIGN COMPANIES TO INVEST AND OPERATE IN CHINA.

29:55 IN A MINUTE, THE DATA POINT IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS,

29:58 FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT INTO CHINA TURNED NEGATIVE.

30:01 ARE THOSE QUOTES ENOUGH TO TURN THAT AROUND?

30:05 MOHAMED: WORDS WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO

30:08 TURN THIS AROUND. YOU WILL NEED MORE THAN WORDS.

30:13 WHEN HE WILL NEED IS CONSISTENCY.

30:15 PEOPLE NOW CANNOT PREDICT THE POLICY REACTION FUNCTION IN

30:18 CHINA, AND THAT IS CRITICAL IF YOU ARE AN INVESTOR, LET ALONE

30:20 A FOREIGN INVESTOR. HE WILL NEED MORE THAN WORDS.

30:24 JONATHAN: THIS WAS WHAT WE EXPECTED, BUT

30:25 SOMEHOW IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT. TOM:

30:32 HARKENING 2024, 2025, WOULD YOU SUGGEST THAT THE CRITICAL POINT

30:37 IS TO BRING SOME FORM OF CAPITALISTIC STRUCTURE BACK TO

30:38 HONG KONG? THEY TRASHED HONG KONG, DO THEY

30:39 NEED TO BRING IT BACK? MOHAMED: IT IS BEYOND THAT.

30:45 THEY NEED TO INVOLVE THEIR GROWTH MODEL AND STOP PULLING

30:47 EVERYTHING UP TO THE TOP, PUSHING IT BACK DOWN.

30:52 LET THE BOTTOM UP FORCES ACT AND CRITICALLY UNDERSTAND THE

30:55 NEED TO TRANSITION TO A CONSUMER-LET ECONOMY.

31:01 -- CONSUMER-LED ECONOMY. IT'S HARD BUT WITHOUT THAT THEY

31:03 WILL GET STUCK IN THE MIDDLE INCOME TRAP. TOM:

31:10 HAVE TALKED ABOUT A CONSUMER-LED ECONOMY SINCE

31:11 JONATHAN SPENCER WAS A YOUNG MAN AND IT HASN'T HAPPENED.

31:14 MOHAMED: PART OF A CONSUMER-LED ECONOMY

31:16 IS TO GIVE UP CONTROL AND THAT IS THE HESITANCY.

31:21 THEY ARE SCARED ABOUT TWO THINGS. ONE, LOSING CONTROL.

31:25 TWO, THAT THIS WILL COME WITH SOME KIND OF CORRUPTION.

31:30 THAT IS WHY THEY ARE GOING SLOW TALKING ABOUT HIGH-QUALITY

31:31 GROWTH BUT NOT PUTTING IN PLACE WHAT IS NEEDED FOR HIGH-QUALITY

31:32 GROWTH. JONATHAN: HUGE CHALLENGES.

31:39 I WANT TO SQUEEZE IN THIS STORY. THE GRAND PRIX, FORMULA ONE,

31:44 HERE IS THE DRAMA.TEMPERS ARE FLARING

31:45 AFTER ORGANIZERS CANCELED THE FIRST PRACTICE SESSION AFTER

31:51 NINE MINUTES WHEN FERRARI BADLY DAMAGED HIS CAR DRIVING OVER A

31:55 LOOSE MANHOLE COVER. SAYING, WE HAD A VERY TOUGH FP1

32:01 THAT WILL COST A FORTUNE. IT IS UNACCEPTABLE.

32:10 TOTO WOLF OF MERCEDES, FORMULA ONE, ARE THEY SACRIFICING THE

32:12 INTEGRITY OF THE SPORT CHASING COMMERCIAL OBJECTIVES IN THE

32:14 UNITED STATES OF AMERICA? TOTO WOLF, THEY WILL SEAL THE

32:19 DRAIN COVERS AND NO ONE WILL TALK ABOUT IT TOMORROW MORNING.

32:22 WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT AND IT'S COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS.

32:24 YOU'RE SPEAKING ABOUT A DRAIN COVER THAT HAS BEEN UNDONE AND

32:27 IT HAS HAPPENED BEFORE. SEVERAL YEARS AGO.

32:32 ULTIMATELY, THIS IS WHAT WE FEARED.

32:35 YOU CHASE THIS COMMERCIAL GAIN AND TO GO TO PLACES LIKE LAS

32:38 VEGAS AND END UP IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS. TOM:

32:43 THE RISK IS THERE. ALONZO JUST MISSED TURN 12 AND

32:47 OTHER PEOPLE HAVE MISSED TURNED 12. THIS COURSE IS BRAND-NEW.

32:49 FOR THE SAFETY OF THE DRIVERS, THAT'S NOT GOOD. JONATHAN:

32:55 WE ALL WISH IT THE BEST OF LUCK OVER THE WEEKEND AND HOPE THAT

32:58 IT IS SUCCESSFUL IN LAS VEGAS, BUT BIG CHALLENGES. TOM:

33:04 WE WILL SEE AND WE WILL CONTINUE, BRINGING ALL OF THAT

33:05 TOGETHER. SIMON GORDON, CHIEF ECONOMIST,

33:11 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO WRITE ABOUT INTO THE WEEKEND INTO

33:12 MONDAY? WE HAVE DEFLATION, WEAKER

33:18 DEMAND, DIFFERENT DYNAMICS, AND A STOCK MARKET TO THE MOON.

33:20 HOW DO YOU SYNTHESIZE THAT TOGETHER? SIMON:

33:25 I WAS LISTENING TO YOUR CONVERSATION FIVE MINUTES AGO

33:27 WITH THE IDEA THAT THE U.S. 10-YEAR TREASURIES ARE TRADING

33:34 LIKE A PENNY STOCK. THE PARALLELS BETWEEN THE

33:36 MAGNIFICENT SEVEN AND EQUITY MARKETS, HOW DO YOU PULL THOSE

33:37 TOGETHER? YOU HAVE SEEN HUGE PRO CYCLIC

33:44 HAL IT IN PRICING IN CAPITAL MARKETS, BOND MARKETS AS WELL.

33:50 I THINK IT IS PERHAPS NOT A

33:58 SHORT-TERM TRADING IDEA OR A POINT OF NEAR TERM DIRECTION

34:01 AND POLLS, BUT THE FINANCIAL STABILITY POINT, THE HEALTH OF

34:05 THE CAPITAL MARKETS, EFFICIENCY, THE TYPE OF SOCIAL

34:08 GOOD THAT CAPITAL MARKETS TO DO, IS IT A GOOD IDEA THAT YOU

34:14 ARE A CORNERSTONE PRICING AS SET IN THE TREASURY MARKET AND

34:20 SUCH A SINKHOLE FOR EQUITY CAPITAL IS BEHAVING LIKE THAT?

34:22 I DON'T THINK IT IS. I WONDER IF THE REGULATORS WANT

34:28 TO, GIVEN ALL OF THE OTHER CHALLENGES ON THEIR PLATE, GET

34:31 INTO A DEBATE OF DECOMPOSING WHY THE BIG ASSET CLASSES ARE

34:35 TRADING LIKE THAT AND WHAT IT DOES TO FINANCIAL STABILITY,

34:38 ECONOMIC GROWTH, AND EFFICIENCY? TOM:

34:41 CAN THE CAPITALISTS GET ON THE SAME PAGE AS THE PEOPLE IN 2024?

34:48 PARTICULARLY AFTER WHAT WE WITNESSED IN SAN FRANCISCO.

34:50 THEY SEEM TO BE A BIT REMOVED. SIMON:

34:54 THE SOCIAL LICENSE OF CAPITAL MARKETS IS VERY IMPORTANT.

35:04 LOOK, THERE HAS BEEN QUITE A LOT OF, PARTICULARLY IN THE

35:08 UNITED STATES ECONOMY, POST-PANDEMIC ENCOURAGING

35:12 REDISTRIBUTION, REDUCTION IN POVERTY LEVELS, BUT THAT HAS

35:14 LARGELY BEEN THE RESPONSE OF FISCAL POLICY POST-PANDEMIC.

35:21 AGAIN, TAKING IT BACK FROM THE NEAR-TERM CALL TO WHAT WE'VE

35:24 LEARNED ABOUT A RESPONSE TO A BIG ECONOMIC CONTRACTION AND

35:26 THE NATURE OF FISCAL TRANSFERS AND WHAT THAT DOES TO GROWTH

35:30 AND REDISTRIBUTION. I THINK THAT THERE'S A BIG

35:35 DIVERGENCE IN THE EXPERIENCE OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIES AND THE

35:37 U.S. ECONOMY THAT I THINK WILL FRAME

35:45 RESPONSES TO FINANCIAL CONTRACTIONS, ECONOMIC

35:50 CONTRACTIONS, FOR YEARS TO COME. MOHAMED:

35:52 IMAGINE A REGULATOR CALLING AFTER THIS INTERVIEW SAYING, I

35:54 TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU. THE VOLATILITY IN THE BOND

35:57 MARKET RISKS FINANCIAL STABILITY.

35:58 WHY HAS IT HAPPENED AND WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT IT?

36:02 WHAT WOULD YOU SAY? SIMON: I THINK REGULATORS FOR A LONG

36:05 TIME, AND THIS IS A BIPARTISAN COMMENT, NOT AIMED AT ANY

36:09 PARTICULAR REGULATOR, HAVE TAKEN QUITE A CONSUMER-CENTRIC

36:17 APPROACH TO HOW THE ULTIMATE INVESTOR ALLOCATES CAPITAL.

36:22 A REDUCTION IN FEES, PASSIVE ALLOCATION, WHICH GENERATES IN

36:27 MY VIEW MORE PROCYCLICAL PRICING AND HEIGHTENS FINANCIAL

36:32 RESPONSIBILITY.

36:33 MY RESPONSE TO THE REGULATOR SAID, THIS ISN'T A FREE LUNCH.

36:38 YES, YOU ARE UNDOUBTABLY GENERATING MORE CONSUMER

36:41 SURPLUS FOR THE END SAVOR, BUT ARE YOU INTRODUCING MORE

36:42 FINANCIAL STABILITY RISK? YES, YOU ARE.

36:47 ARE YOU HAPPY WITH THAT TRADE? IF NOT, YOU NEED TO VOCALIZE

36:52 WHAT YOU WILL DO WITH IT IF NOT THE REDISTRIBUTION OF THE

36:56 CONSUMER SURPLUS IS THE WAY TO LEAN INTO IT. MOHAMED:

36:59 THEY CONTINUE SAYING, YOU ARE A WORRIER. LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF

37:02 VOLATILITY AND NOTHING HAS BROKEN, THE SYSTEM IS RESILIENT.

37:04 WHAT WOULD YOU SAY? SIMON: I WOULD SAY -- TO SAY THAT

37:12 NOTHING IS BROKEN GIVEN SOME OF THE TURBULENCE WE'VE SEEN IN

37:17 TERMS OF MONEY MARKET FUNDS EARLIER IN THE YEAR, THE

37:21 BANKING SYSTEM, BEING REALLY STRESSED IN THE U.S.

37:24 ECONOMY, THERE ARE SIGNS APLENTY THAT THIS ISN'T A

37:26 HEALTHY BACKDROP.

37:32 THE FACT THAT WE HAVE AVERTED THROUGH THE RELATIVELY RAPID

37:35 RESPONSE FROM THE CORPORATE SECTOR AND REGULATORS DOESN'T

37:38 MEAN THAT THE RISKS HAVE GONE AWAY.

37:42 MAYBE WE HAVE BEEN LUCKY, BUT HOW LONG DO YOU WANT TO STAY

37:44 LUCKY? I THINK WE NEED TO BE AHEAD OF

37:49 THESE DEBATES RATHER THAN BEING CONSTANTLY REACTIVE TO THESE

37:53 EVENTS. JONATHAN: SIMON FRENCH OUT OF LONDON.

37:56 HE IS RIGHT, SURELY THINGS DID BREAK. BIG BANKS WENT UNDER.

38:00 WE MOVED AWAY FROM THAT PRETTY QUICKLY.

38:02 SPRING FEELS LIKE A LIFETIME AGO, BUT THINGS BROKE, DIDN'T

38:03 THEY?

38:04 MOHAMED: THEY BROKE IN A VERY CONTAINED

38:09 FASHION. THE BIG ISSUE WE DON'T TALK

38:11 ABOUT IS WE CHANGED THE SYSTEM.

38:14 WE HAVE THE EXTENDED DEPOSIT INSURANCE TO ALL BANKS, TO ALL

38:19 DEPOSITS. TOM: LET ME GIVE A LECTURE FROM

38:23 QUEENS COLLEGE IN CAMBRIDGE. THIS WAS NOTHING MORE THAN A

38:28 BAIL OUT OF FANCY PEOPLE. THE BANKS THAT WENT UNDER WERE

38:33 NO MORE THAN MARKETING CONCEPTS FOR THE RICH PEOPLE, THE RICH

38:36 GUYS, AND WE USE THE INSTITUTIONAL INSURANCE.

38:38 I WOULD LOVE SPENCER ON THIS. THE INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE TO

38:41 BAIL OUT THE RICH GUYS.

38:44 MOHAMED: IF YOU BAILOUT THE RICH GUYS,

38:48 YOU HAVE TO BAIL OUT EVERYONE. THAT IS DEPOSIT INSURANCE.

38:53 JONATHAN: 4.40 ON THE 10-YEAR.

39:00 SURPRISES IN COMMODITIES WITH

39:16 >> A LOT OF THE INFLATION AND POLLS ON THE WAY UP WAS FROM

39:19 HIGHER OIL PRICES, OIL PRICES HAVE COME BACK DOWN AND

39:23 COMMODITY PRICES ARE UNDER PRESSURE.

39:26 IF WE IMAGINE CHINA GRADUALLY COMING BACK TO STRONG GROWTH,

39:28 THE U.S. STAYS RESILIENT, I THINK WE

39:31 WILL HAVE TO BE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER FOR A LITTLE BIT LONGER.

39:33 MOHAMED: HIGHER FOR LONGER -- JONATHAN:

39:36 HIGHER FOR LONGER.

39:42 SPEAKING AT THE SINGAPORE FINTECH FESTIVAL.

39:44 WELCOME TO THE FUTURE. EQUITY FUTURES LOOKING A LITTLE

39:48 SOMETHING LIKE THIS, POSITED BY CLOSE TO 0.2%.

39:52 THREE DAYS OF GAINS COULD HELP US GET TO THREE WEEKS OF GAINS

39:54 ON THE S&P 500. YIELDS LOWER. ON THE 10-YEAR WE HAD A BRIEF

40:01 BREAK OF 4.40, BACK ABOVE IT NOW AT 4.4082.

40:07 LET'S GET ONE NAME IN THE PREMARKET.

40:08 SHARES OF MANCHESTER UNITED. A REPORT FROM SKY NEWS IN THE

40:14 LAST HOUR, FINALLY, I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS

40:18 FOR AGES, A DEAL TO BUY 25% OF THE CLUB FOR $33 A SHARE EARLY

40:21 NEXT WEEK. TOM: I LOOK AT IT AS AN AMATEUR.

40:27 YOU ARE PROS AT THIS. THE ANSWER IS HE LOOKS AWFUL

40:29 LONELY OUT THERE. JONATHAN: THE TEAM? TOM:

40:34 THEY NEED A REBUILD WITH THEIR NEW OWNERS. MOHAMED:

40:37 HE WAS ON THE BENCH FOR THE LAST GAME. JONATHAN:

40:40 HE WASN'T PLAYING WELL. TOM: WHO DOES HE HAVE TO PLAY WITH?

40:45 JONATHAN: THEY HAVE TAKEN CRITICISM FOR

40:48 HOW THEY HAVE RUN THE CLUB, AND I UNDERSTAND, BUT THEY HAVE

40:51 SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON PLAYERS WHO HAVEN'T GOTTEN IT DONE.

40:54 THE CLUB LOOKS ROTTEN ON THE PITCH AND OFF THE PITCH.

40:58 MOHAMED: WHY BY 30%? YOU DON'T HAVE CONTROL.

41:01 JONATHAN: IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY WANT TO

41:06 SELL THE CLUB TO THE QATARI'S BUT THE GLAZER'S WANT TO RETAIN

41:08 A BIG STEAK. I WONDER IF YOU HAS A BIG SAY?

41:14 MAYBE THE SIDE OF THE BUSINESS THAT THE GLAZIERS HAVEN'T? TOM:

41:21 BLOOMBERG WORLDWIDE PICKED UP LIKE NO INTERVIEW WE'VE EVER

41:24 DONE, JON FERRO, THAT WAS REALLY FASCINATING. JONATHAN:

41:26 DANIEL LEAVY. TOM: I HAVE TO GET THIS IN.

41:32 ALONZO, AT TURN 12, FOR ALREADY DOING WELL IN P2.

41:38 QUALITIES IN ROME AS WELL. THE UPROAR IN ROME IS NORTH

41:46 MACEDONIANS ARE NOT SHOWING UP AS TOURISTS THIS TIME. JONATHAN:

41:50 QUALIFIER FOR THE EUROS IN ITALY AGAIN.

41:53 IT IS THE GROUP STAGE. THEY HAVE TWO GAMES LEFT. TOM:

42:00 IF NORTH MACEDONIA -- IT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN -- IF THEY WERE TO

42:02 DEFEAT ITALY IT WOULD BE ONE AND DONE? JONATHAN:

42:05 WE WOULD BE THREE POINTS BEHIND UKRAINE, I BELIEVE. MOHAMED:

42:10 REMIND THE AUDIENCE WHY THIS IS SO PAINFUL. JONATHAN:

42:15 I APPRECIATE THIS BETWEEN FRIENDS.

42:17 NORTH MACEDONIA KICKED US OUT OF WORLD CUP QUALIFYING NOT TOO

42:18 LONG AGO. DO YOU WANT ME TO CARRY ON

42:21 WORKING HERE? I AM WALKING AWAY. TOM:

42:29 OIL DISINFLATION. STEPHEN, HOW DOES THE NEW YORK

42:36 HARBOR ADJUST TO OIL DEFLATION?

42:43 JET FUEL, DIESEL, HOW DO THEY ADJUST AS COLLAPSE IN OIL?

42:46 STEPHEN: IT IS AN INTERESTING QUESTION

42:50 WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT AS WE SPEAK.

42:52 WHEN WE LOOK AT THE SPREAD ACTION BETWEEN GASOLINE AND

42:58 INVENTORIES, SEEMINGLY THERE IS ENOUGH OIL, GASOLINE, IN NEW

43:03 YORK HARBOR. NEW YORK HARBOR IS IMPORTANT

43:05 BECAUSE THAT IS THE DELIVERY

43:11 HUB FOR THE MERCANTILES DIESEL AND GASOLINE CONTRACTS.

43:14 WHEN WE LOOK AT SUPPLY RELATIVE TO DEMAND, WE ARE LOOKING AT 24

43:21 DAYS WORTH OF A SUPPLY OF GASOLINE.THAT IS NORMAL.

43:23 SPOT ON TO THE FIVE-YEAR AVERAGE, SLIGHTLY ABOVE.

43:27 THE PROBLEM NOW IS THAT TRADERS ARE SKEPTICAL.

43:30 THEY ARE PRICING IN A PREMIUM ON THE FRONT END OF THE CURVE,

43:34 WHICH IS A CLEAR SIGNAL THAT SOMEONE IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE

43:37 SUPPLIES, REGARDLESS OF THE FACT THAT WE HAVE ALL OF THE

43:40 DAYS WORTH OF SUPPLY. THE OTHER ISSUE IS JET FUEL.

43:45 NOW, WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH. JET FUEL STOCKS ARE EXTREMELY

43:51 LOW. AS WE LOOK FORWARD TO NEXT

43:54 WEEK, WE EXPECT THIS, OR AAA EXPECTS IT TO BE ONE OF THE

43:57 BUSIEST TRAVEL SEASONS ON THANKSGIVING IN THE LAST 20-ODD

44:02 YEARS.YOU LOOK AT THE RISE IN DEMAND AND SPREAD ACTION,

44:03 SOMETHING IS AFOOT. IT DOESN'T LINE UP THAT THE

44:08 SPREADS ARE SAYING ONE THING, THERE IS NOT ENOUGH SUPPLY,

44:12 REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE ARE SEEING AN WEEKLY INVENTORY

44:14 REPORTS. JONATHAN: THE SAUDI'S ARE FRUSTRATED WITH

44:16 THE PRICE ACTION. I WONDER IF THEY ARE FRUSTRATED

44:19 ENOUGH TO CHANGE POLICY AGAIN? STEPHEN: IT IS INTERESTING.

44:23 IT IS A CONUNDRUM. TO BE HONEST, I AM PERPLEXED

44:30 THAT THE MARKET NEVER REALLY PRICED IN ANY RISK PREMIUM WITH

44:34 REGARDS TO WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE MIDDLE EAST. LET'S BE

44:41 CLEAR, THIS IS A WAR NOT BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS BUT

44:44 BETWEEN ISRAEL AND IRAN GIVEN THAT WE ARE FIGHTING -- ISRAEL

44:52 IS FIGHTING HAMAS, HEZBOLLAH, BACKED BY IRAN.

44:58 THAT IS A SCARY PROPOSITION, IRAN'S ABILITY TO STOP THE FLOW

45:01 OF OIL FROM THE STRAIGHT OF HORMUZ.

45:05 IT IS AHEAD SCRATCHER THAT WE HAVE THIS HUGE RISK ON SUPPLY

45:10 BUT THE MARKET REFUSES TO PRICE THAT IN.

45:13 WE AREFOCUSING ON THE DEMAND PICTURE .

45:15 IF YOU ARE IN TEXAS AND YOU ARE TRYING TO PRODUCE, AND YOU ARE

45:19 LOOKING AT THIS PRICE ACTION, YOU ARE FRUSTRATED AT THIS

45:22 POINT. I WANT TO SAY, BASED ON OUR

45:25 MODELING, WE ARE LIKELY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE MARKET RIGHT NOW

45:30 GIVEN THE SITUATION AROUND THE GLOBE AND THE IMBALANCE BETWEEN

45:34 SUPPLY AND DEMAND. MOHAMED: DO YOU THINK THAT THE SAUDIS

45:41 WILL WAIT THIS OUT OR THEY WILL BE ON TO THE RUSSIANS OR ANY

45:46 OPEC-PLUS MEMBER THAT IS WILLING TO PARTICIPATE IN

45:50 ANOTHER CUT IN PRODUCTION? STEPHEN:

45:52 I DO THINK THAT THERE IS A CONCERN THAT WE WILL SEE

45:55 FURTHER CUTS. ALREADY THE SAUDIS AND RUSSIA

45:57 HAVE EXTENDED THEIR VOLUNTARY CUTS TO THE END OF THE YEAR.

46:03 WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN OIL PRICES, UNLIKE THE PRODUCT

46:07 PRICES, WE HAVE SEEN AN ABSOLUTE COLLAPSE IN THE FRONT

46:08 END OF THE CURVE.

46:14 WE HAVE MOVED INTO A SITUATION MEANING THAT PRICES IN

46:18 NEAR-TERM DELIVERY ARE BELOW PRICES FOR LONGER-TERM DELIVERY.

46:23 THIS IS A CLEAR TAKEAWAY THAT FROM AN LOYAL STANDPOINT THE

46:25 FUNDAMENTALS ARE EXTREMELY WEAK. I WOULD SUSPECT THAT WE WILL

46:34 SEE, CHANCES ARE GOING INTO THE QUARTER, OPEC-PLUS EITHER

46:39 EXTENDING THE CUTS OR PUSHING THOSE CUTS INTO THE NEW YEAR.

46:42 TOM: IN THE ARK OF BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE'S 20 YEARS, A

46:46 GREAT SHOCK HAS BEEN AMERICA'S SUCCESS WITH HYDROCARBONS.

46:49 INTO THE NEW YEAR, R.O.E.

46:55 ENERGY AND -- ENTERED -- INTO THE NEW YEAR, ARE WE ENERGY

46:57 INDEPENDENT? STEPHEN: NO.

47:05 ENERGY INDEPENDENCE DOES NOT MEAN YOU DON'T HAVE TO IMPOR T.

47:10 WE WERE THE DOMINANT CRUDE OIL PRODUCER IN THE WORLD AND WE

47:12 WERE THE SWING PRODUCER.FOR ALL INTENT S AND PURPOSES WE WERE

47:17 ENERGY INDEPENDENT WHEN IT COMES TO HYDROCARBONS, AND THAT

47:22 IS A SHOUT OUT TO HOW WELL AND EFFICIENT THE INDUSTRY HAS

47:27 GROWN OVER THE PAST 15 TO 20 YEARS.

47:29 GIVEN THE CURRENT POLICY NOW, WE ARE NOT ENERGY INDEPENDENT

47:33 AND THE BIG RISK IS THAT WE ARE PLAYING A ZERO-SUM GAME.

47:36 THAT'S TO SAY THAT WE ARE

47:45 TAKING OFF DISPATCHABLE BTU FASTER THAN WE CAN REPLACE THEM

47:47 WITH RENEWABLES. THAT'S FACT. REGULATORS ARE TELLING THE

47:52 GOVERNMENT, YET THE GOVERNMENT IS STILL GOING AHEAD AND

47:57 FORCING THESE RETIREMENTS WHERE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH POWER.

48:00 EVERYONE OUT THERE, GET USED TO THIS AND GET READY.

48:06 THERE WILL BE A HUGE JUMP IN VOLATILITY, A HUGE JUMP IN

48:10 PRICING FOR ELECTRICITY AND ALTERNATIVE BTU'S BECAUSE WE

48:14 ARE NOT QUITE READY FOR THE TRANSITION THE GOVERNMENT IS

48:15 FORCING UPON THE INDUSTRY. JONATHAN: A BIG WARNING.

48:19 THE SHORE GROUP. WE WILL CATCH UP BEFORE YEAR

48:21 END. AMAZING TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT ENERGY

48:25 INDEPENDENCE.

48:31 TOM: IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE.

48:36 SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY. KEEPING THE RANGERS OUT OF THE

48:42 BOTTOM OF SAID LEAGUE. A JOB OPENING, JON. JONATHAN:

48:49 I HAVE SAID A MILLION TIMES THAT WE SHOULD PUT TOGETHER A

48:51 CONSORTIUM. TOM:

48:57 CAN WE MAKE THIS A JOB INTERVIEW?

48:59 WHAT ARE THE VALUES OF RESURGENCE OF QPR? MOHAMED:

49:03 HUGE. THEY HAVE THE BEST GROUNDS IN

49:06 LONDON, THE MOST INFAMOUS GROUNDS. I AM WITH YOU.

49:09 YOU GO IN THE LEAD. TOM: JON FERRO LEADING US.

49:16 JONATHAN: IF ANYONE IS LISTENING, PERHAPS

49:18 IN SAUDI ARABIA THAT MIGHT HAVE SOME MONEY --

49:40 >> I CANNOT THINK OF A TIME THERE IS BEEN QUITE THIS MUCH

49:44 DIVERGENCE.

49:45 >> PUSHING BACK ON PRICE AND THAT IS WHY PRICES ARE COMING

49:48 DOWN.

49:49 >> HIGH INTEREST COSTS ARE COMING, THEY ARE HERE.

49:56 >> I WOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT A DEFLATION SCENARIO IN THE U.S.

50:00 >>'S GROWTH GOING TO SLOW DOWN? I THINK SO.

50:05 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE WITH TOM KEENE,

50:08 JONATHAN FERRO, LISA ABRAMOWICZ. JONATHAN:

50:13 FOR OUR AUDIENCE WORLDWIDE, THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE

50:14 ON TV AND RADIO. TOGETHER FOR THE NEXT 60

50:19 MINUTES WITH THE BRILLIANT MOHAMED EL-ERIAN.

50:23 YOUR EQUITY MARKET POSITIVE .2% ON THE S&P.

50:27 AT THE START OF THE WEEK WE WERE TALKING ABOUT DISINFLATION

50:32 COME AT THE END OF THE WEEK WE ARE TALKING ABOUT DEFLATION AND

50:34 MAY BE AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. TOM: FRACTURED MARKETS IN A

50:39 FRACTURED WORLD. WE WILL TALK ABOUT MOHAMED

50:43 EL-ERIAN'S BOOK IN A MOMENT. WE'VE BEEN DOING ASIDE CHAT ON

50:48 SPORTS, FORMULA ONE AND SOCCER. HUGE TURMOIL IN THE MARKET.

50:54 THIS WILL BE EVENTFUL TO THE FED MEETING. JONATHAN:

51:00 I REMEMBER JAMES OF ABERDEEN SAID NARRATIVE TABLE TENNIS.

51:03 THAT IS WHAT IT HAS FELT LIKE WEEK AFTER WEEK AND SOMETIMES

51:07 DAY AFTER DAY SWITCHING BETWEEN VERY DIFFERENT VIEWS ON THE

51:10 NEXT 12 MONTHS. MOHAMED: THINK ABOUT IT.

51:19 FOR THE LAST 15 MONTHS CONSENSUS FOR THE BIGGEST AND

51:23 MOST MATURE ECONOMY HAS GONE FROM SOFT LANDING TO HARD

51:25 LANDING TO NO LANDING TO CRASH LANDING BACK A HARD LANDING,

51:29 SOFT LANDING, NOW WE TALK ABOUT DEFLATION.

51:32 IT IS HARD TO EXPLAIN WHY WE CANNOT HAVE STABILITY IN THE

51:35 MOST FUNDAMENTAL NARRATIVE. TOM: HERE IS THE BOOK COVER, THE

51:42 MOVIE COMING TO NETFLIX, WE ARE THINKING THREE YEARS OUT.

51:47 YOU SPOKE TO GORDON BROWN. MOHAMED EL-ERIAN.

51:52 MICHAEL SPENCE ON THIS. HOW IN GOD'S NAME DID WE GET TO

51:55 WHERE WE ARE? THAT IS A LOADED QUESTION.

52:00 JONATHAN: THE VIEW OF THIS BOOK IS NOT

52:01 ALL DOOM AND GLOOM. THERE ARE CONSTRUCTIVE

52:04 RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT HOW WE GET OUT OF THIS AND IT DOES

52:08 FEEL LIKE A PERM A CRISIS. HOW DO WE GET OUT OF THIS?

52:13 MOHAMED: BY UNDERSTANDING THE THREE

52:16 COMMON CAUSES TO THE CRISIS. LOW GROWTH THAT IS

52:21 INSUFFICIENTLY INCLUSIVE AND DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE

52:22 PLANET. TWO IS REPEATED POLICY MISTAKES

52:28 AND THREE IS INADEQUATE GLOBAL POLICY COORDINATION.

52:32 ALL THREE CAN BE ADDRESSED AND IT IS A HOPEFUL BOOK BECAUSE WE

52:35 BELIEVE WE ARE ON THE VERGE OF A PRODUCTIVITY SEARCH LED BY

52:42 TECHNOLOGY AND DEGENERATIVE AI, SCIENCES, AND THE CLIMATE

52:43 TRANSITION. THIS WILL BE AN EXCITING TIME

52:47 IF WE GET POLICIES ALIGNED. TOM: OUT OF THE PANDEMIC PRIME

52:55 MINISTER BROWN HAS LIVED BUDGET DEFICITS, THE UNITED KINGDOM

52:57 AUSTERITY. NOW WE HAVE THE INTEREST

53:00 EXPENSE AND A REAL RATE REGIME THAT IS NORMAL.

53:05 HOW DO YOU HANDLE THE FISCAL CHALLENGES? MOHAMED:

53:07 THERE ARE FOUR WAYS TO DO IT.

53:11 YOU HAVE GROWTH, AUSTERITY, FINANCIAL ENGINEERING, OR DEBT

53:15 RESCHEDULING. GROWTH IS THE BEST RESPONSE.

53:19 THE OTHER THREE ARE PROBLEMATIC SO WE FOCUS ON ECONOMIC GROWTH.

53:23 TOM: THE HEADLINE IS MOHAMED EL-ERIAN SAYS AMERICA IS LIKE

53:27 GREECE. MOHAMED: I SAID AMERICA IS THE MOST

53:34 ADVANCED IN THE GROWTH TRANSITION BECAUSE THEY

53:37 UNDERSTOOD YOU HAVE TO EVOLVE YOUR GROWTH MODEL. THE U.S.

53:41 IS WAY AHEAD OF EUROPE AND CHINA IS LAGGING. TOM:

53:44 ARE THEY DIMINISHED BY AUSTERITY.

53:47 IT IS AN OLD WORLD ISSUE. ARE THEY TOO AUSTERE?

53:54 MOHAMED: NOBODY IS AUSTERE RIGHT NOW BUT

53:59 WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED IS YOU CANNOT SHRINK GROWTH IF YOU

54:00 HAVE TO SHRINK CONSISTENTLY. YOU WOULD BE AMAZED HOW MANY

54:05 COUNTRIES GET STUCK ON THIS AUSTERITY TRACK. JONATHAN:

54:08 THIS WILL BE AWAKE -- THIS WILL BE A BIG FIGHT IN WASHINGTON,

54:12 D.C. POSITIVE .2% ON THE S&P. YIELDS ARE LOWER.

54:22 EARLIER THIS MORNING A BREAK OF 4.40%.

54:27 JOINING US IS JAY PELOSKY, FOUNDER OF DPW ADVISORY.

54:30 IN YOUR NOTES THIS LINE JUMPS OUT.

54:35 CURRENT CONDITIONS ARE ALMOST TAILOR-MADE FOR A YEAR END

54:36 RALLY. WALK US THROUGH IT. JAY:

54:42 WE ARE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF A CLASSIC INTERNET RALLY.

54:46 ALL OF THE FACTORS ARE LINING UP.

54:51 YOU HAVE SEASONALITY NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER.

54:55 YOU HAVE SENTIMENT UNTIL THE PAST WEEK HAS BEEN VERY BEARISH.

54:58 YOU HAVE POSITIONING WHERE HEDGE FUNDS ARE THE LARGEST NET

55:02 SHORT POSITION IN FIVE YEARS. CTAS ARE OFFSIDES.

55:09 INSTITUTIONS ARE UNDERPERFORMING AND RETAIL SOLD

55:14 THE MOST STOCK LAST MONTH OF ANY MONTH IN THE LAST TWO YEARS.

55:18 IMAGINE THE TECHNICAL SITUATION WHERE WE HAD A TREMENDOUS SURGE

55:26 IN THE MARKET, AND THEY ARE TYPICALLY VERY POSITIVE.

55:29 IN ADDITION YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF SECTORS AND MARKETS AND

55:34 REGIONS NOW RECAPTURING THEIR 200 DAY MOVING AVERAGE AND YOU

55:40 HAVE SOME LIKE THE SEMICONDUCTOR CYCLE THAT ARE

55:43 BREAKING OUT NEW ALL-TIME HIGHS. VERY POWERFUL AND WE KNOW HOW

55:47 THE PROCESS GOES. HEDGE FUNDS FIRST RECOVER AND

55:53 THEN THEY GO ALONG, AND THEN THE CTAS FLIP, AND THEN THE

55:58 INSTITUTIONS PANIC, THEY ARE UNDERPERFORMING.

56:00 THEY START TO CHASE. RETAIL JOINS THE SHOW.

56:06 VERY CONSTRUCTIVE BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THE YEAR. TOM:

56:12 DO WE DO THAT WITH A RENEWED BREATH OR DO WE DO IT WITH A

56:16 CONTINUATION ON THE MAGNIFICENT 20 SET? MOHAMED:

56:21 IT IS DEFINITELY -- JAY: IT IS DEFINITELY THE LEADER AND

56:24 THE SEMI'S ARE BREAKING OUT. ONE OF THE DEBATES IS OUR

56:30 RELATE CYCLE ABOUT TO GO INTO A RECESSION OR ARE WE EARLY

56:33 CYCLE, ABOUT TO GO INTO A NEW GROWTH CYCLE.

56:35 I AM IN THE LATER CAMP. THE FACT THAT SEMI'S ARE

56:41 BREAKING OUT ALL-TIME HIGHS IS CONSTRUCTIVE.

56:45 TECH LEADS BUT YOU HAVE OTHER SEGMENTS LIKE EMERGING MARKETS

56:47 WHERE WE ARE QUITE KEEN ON. EMERGING MARKETS JUST

56:53 RECAPTURED THEIR 200 DAY MOVING AVERAGE.

56:55 HOMEBUILDERS DOING WELL. PARTS OF THE MARKET STARTING TO

57:02 SNIFF OUT THE FACT THAT INTEREST RATES ARE COMING DOWN,

57:07 THE FED IS DONE, ALL OF THAT IS CONSTRUCTIVE FOR THE BROADER

57:09 MARKET THAT HAS BEEN LABORING UNDER THE IDEA THAT RATES ARE

57:12 HIGHER FOR LONGER. MOHAMED: I SUSPECT A LOT OF PEOPLE

57:20 WATCHING YOU WOULD TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOUR TECHNICAL

57:23 ANALYSIS, THE HANDOFF FROM ONE SEGMENT OF INVESTORS TO THE

57:24 OTHER. WHERE THEY MAY PUSH BACK IS THE

57:32 EVEN MORE BULLISH CALL THAT YOU WILL HANDOFF ON POSITIVE

57:33 TECHNICALS TO POSITIVE FUNDAMENTALS.

57:35 WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE THE ECONOMY WILL RESPOND TO THE

57:39 LOWER INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT? JAY:

57:44 ONE THING, WHAT REALLY DRIVES STOCKS ARE EARNINGS.

57:47 WE JUST CAME THROUGH Q3. Q3 WAS BETTER-THAN-EXPECTED FOR

57:52 YEAR-OVER-YEAR EARNINGS GROWTH. MORE IMPORTANTLY TO US, BECAUSE

57:59 WE BELIEVE YOU HAVE TO FOCUS FORWARD IN TODAY'S MARKETS,

58:03 PARTICULAR WITH THE NARRATIVE PING-PONG YOU WERE TALKING

58:04 ABOUT A FEW MINUTES AGO. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A VISION AND A

58:07 PROCESS.

58:14 THE FACT THAT EARNINGS FOR NEXT YEAR, 2024, ARE DOUBLE-DIGIT,

58:16 THEY HAVE HELD IN. PEOPLE DID NOT MARK DOWN 24.

58:21 THAT IS VERY CONSTRUCTIVE. WE JUST PUT OUT OUR 2024

58:30 OUTLOOK SEVERAL WEEKS AGO IN OCTOBER CALLED SURPRISE,

58:34 SURPRISE AND WE LAID OUT FOUR MACRO SURPRISES.

58:37 I WILL MENTION TWO. WHAT IS INFLATION COMES DOWN

58:43 SOONER THAN EXPECTED AND FASTER THAN EXPECTED AND

58:44 LOWER-THAN-EXPECTED.

58:51 IN THE SECOND PLACE, DIRECTLY TO WHAT YOU FOLKS WERE JUST

58:55 TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF STABILITY, WE BELIEVE WE ARE ON

58:57 THE CUSP OF MACRO STABILITY. WE WOULD POINT OUT THAT

59:03 NOTWITHSTANDING THE NARRATIVE PING-PONG, THE VIX IS UNDER 50.

59:06 THERE IS A LOT GOING ON WE THINK IS VERY POSITIVE AND THE

59:13 MARKET IS STARTING TO SNIFF OUT AND IT MAKES US CONSTRUCTIVE

59:15 INTO 2024. JONATHAN: TYPICALLY WHEN YOU'RE

59:20 CONSTRUCTIVE YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT THE REST OF THE WORLD.

59:23 IN MY HEARING TECH IN THE UNITED STATES? JAY:

59:27 I HAVE CONVERTED. WE DID GO DIRECTLY TO U.S.

59:32 TECH IN OUR LATEST PORTFOLIO UPDATE.

59:39 WE HAVE BEEN LONG SEMIS FOR THE WHOLE YEAR SO THAT SPACE HAS

59:41 BEEN ONE WE HAVE PARTICIPATED IN.

59:46 WE ARE BELIEVERS THAT BIG TECH -- THE IDEA WAS THAT HIGHER

59:52 RATES WOULD HURT BIG TECH BECAUSE OF THE WAY PEOPLE VALUE

59:53 LONG-TERM CASH FLOWS. THE REALITY OF TODAY IS BIG

59:59 TECH ARE MONEYMAKING MACHINES AND THEY ARE PRINTING MONEY ON

01:00:02 TOP OF THE MONEY THEY ALREADY PRINTED IN TERMS OF INTEREST

01:00:04 RATES AT THIS LEVEL.

01:00:10 TECH IS A LEADER IN SUSTAINING THAT LEADERSHIP BUT THE REST OF

01:00:13 THE WORLD OFFERS A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE THEY HAVE

01:00:16 VALUATION IN EARNINGS GROWTH. THE U.S.

01:00:20 IS CAPPED BY ITS VALUATION. THE REST OF THE WORLD,

01:00:24 VALUATION AND EARNINGS GROWTH. WE CONTINUE TO FAVOR THE REST

01:00:30 OF THE WORLD, PARTICULARLY EMERGING MARKETS. TOM:

01:00:35 WHAT YOU JUST HEARD FROM JAY PELOSKY I WILL SUGGEST IS A

01:00:36 MINORITY OPINION. INTO THIS WEEKEND, THE HOLIDAY

01:00:42 SEASON, PEOPLE CANNOT FATHOM THE TECHNICAL EXTENT. JONATHAN:

01:00:46 THEY CAN BE CONSTRUCTIVE GOING INTO YEAR END BUT HERE IS A BIG

01:00:48 CALL. I KNOW YOU WANTED TO SQUEEZE IN

01:00:52 A QUESTION FOR TOM KEENE. JAY: OUR TWO SCHOOLS WILL MEET ON

01:00:58 THE FIELD OF FOOTBALL TOMORROW. AS A DUKE GUY, I'VE WONDERED

01:01:02 ABOUT THIS.

01:01:09 WHAT THE HECK IS A WAHOO? TOM: I LOOK AT THE WAHOO AND I SAY I

01:01:15 HAVE TO TALK TO SONALI BASAK. SHE IS THE BUCK NOW WONDER.

01:01:20 SHE IS AN ENCYCLOPEDIA ON THIS. SHE IS A BUCKNELL GRAD.

01:01:35 BUCK NOW -- THE BUCKNELL BISONS TAKING ON THE DUKE BLUE DEVILS.

01:01:37 JONATHAN: WHERE DID THESE NAMES COME FROM?

01:01:40 TOM: IT IS TRADITION. THE WHOLE COLLEGE FOOTBALL

01:01:49 THING TO JOHN -- JONATHAN: COLLEGE FOOTBALL TO ME IS

01:01:50 ALABAMA, LSU. TOM: I AM THINKING ABOUT CAMBRIDGE

01:01:55 CRICKET. JONATHAN: THAT IS A REAL SPORT.

01:02:00 IT IS RELAXING IN THE SUMMER. HAVE A COUPLE OF BEERS,

01:02:03 CHILLOUT. MOHAMED: BEER AT A CRICKET GAME?

01:02:07 JONATHAN: IN THE STANDS. NOT WHEN YOU ARE PLAYING.

01:02:13 JAY PELOSKY OF DPW ADVISORY. EQUITIES POSITIVE .2%.

01:02:19 YIELDS LOWER. 4.4063 ON THE 10 YEAR.

01:02:25 TOM: THE 10 YEAR IS THE THERMOMETER.

01:02:30 MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, WHICH MATURITY SHOULD OUR AUDIENCE

01:02:31 FOCUS ON? DO YOU GO OUT TO 30 OR MY 97

01:02:36 YEAR AUSTRIAN? MOHAMED: IT DEPENDS FOR WHAT.

01:02:46 JONATHAN: HAMED HAS NOT HAD TO DO THE

01:02:48 PIMCO ALARM IN A LONG TIME. SETTING THE ALARM TO 3:00 A.M.

01:02:52 TO GO ON THIS SHOW. YOU FORGET WHO PEOPLE ARE.

01:02:58 MOHAMED: YOU SAID IT 10 TIMES BEFORE

01:03:01 HAND BECAUSE YOU ARE WORRIED YOU WILL NOT WAKE UP AT 3:00.

01:03:06 JONATHAN: I NEVER WAKE UP BY THE ALARM, I

01:03:09 ALWAYS WAKE UP BEFORE BY 30 OR 40 MINUTES.

01:03:12 I JUST SORT OF LIE THERE AND ROLL AROUND AND START READING

01:03:16 THE NEWS AND OFTEN TOM WILL MESSAGE ME AT ABOUT 1:00 OR

01:03:19 2:00 A.M. JUST GET THE TEXTS LIGHTING UP

01:03:23 THE PHONE. TOM: IN THE WORLD WE ARE IN, PEOPLE

01:03:30 THINK FERRO WORKS OF FOUR HOUR DAY. I WORK A 4.5 HOUR DAY.

01:03:34 MOHAMED: THEY ARE VERY WRONG. JONATHAN:

01:03:39 MOHAMED IS STICKING AROUND. DAVID LED TO WHICH JOINING US

01:03:43 IN THE NEXT HOUR. LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY THIS

01:04:04 PRES. BIDEN: WE GATHER THIS WEEK AT AN

01:04:07 INFLECTION POINT OF HISTORY. WE CAN HARNESS THE POWER OF THE

01:04:12 PACIFIC TO GROW OUR ECONOMIES AND UPLIFT OUR WORKERS AND

01:04:17 CONNECT OUR PEOPLE TO ONE ANOTHER.

01:04:20 SO MUCH OF THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD WILL BE WRITTEN IN THE

01:04:23 ASIA-PACIFIC IN THE COMING YEARS.

01:04:27 WE MUST NEVER FORGET THAT IS A HISTORY THAT BELONGS TO ALL OF

01:04:28 US. JONATHAN: QUITE A LOVEFEST IN THE LAST 48

01:04:32 HOURS IN CALIFORNIA. PRESIDENT BIDEN HOSTING A

01:04:36 DINNER CAPPING OFF MEETINGS WITH CHINA'S XI JINPING.

01:04:42 THE PRESIDENT LEAVING SAN FRANCISCO TODAY TO SPEND TIME

01:04:43 IN DELAWARE OVER THE WEEKEND. SOME OF THE TIME -- SOME OF THE

01:04:50 LANGUAGE THAT CAME FROM PRESIDENT XI PLEDGING

01:04:52 HEARTWARMING STEPS TO ATTRACT FOREIGN CAPITAL.

01:04:54 WE MENTIONED IT WOULD LIKELY WE WOULD GET THIS CHARM OFFENSIVE

01:04:56 FROM THE LEADER OF CHINA. THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE HAD THIS

01:04:59 WEEK. TOM: WATCH WHERE PEOPLE SIT IN A

01:05:02 GATHERING. TO THE RIGHT OF THE PRESIDENT,

01:05:12 FOLKS ON TV, WAS MR. LEE OF SINGAPORE AFTER HIS MEETING

01:05:14 WITH OUR JOHN MICKLETHWAIT. THIS IS ABOUT CHINA AND THE U.S.

01:05:20 , BUT IN A BROAD SENSE THE PACIFIC RIM AS WELL.

01:05:27 OUR MILITARY, OUR TREATY OBLIGATIONS ON THE APPROACH OF

01:05:30 WASHINGTON TO A PACIFIC RIM OF A NEW CENTURY. JONATHAN:

01:05:34 THEY ARE ALL WITH A BIG INTEREST IN THIS.

01:05:38 THERE ARE TWO COUNTRIES I CAN THINK OF THAT HAVE BENEFITED

01:05:39 FROM THIS TENSION.

01:05:45 VIETNAM, AND SINGAPORE, GIVEN WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH HONG

01:05:46 KONG. SINGAPORE, IF YOU WANTED TO PUT

01:05:49 IN IT -- IF YOU WANTED TO PUT A HEADQUARTERS IN ASIA AND WERE

01:05:53 THINKING ABOUT DOING IT. 15 YEARS AGO MOST PEOPLE IN

01:05:57 FINANCE WOULD SAY HONG KONG. NOW THEY ARE SAYING SINGAPORE.

01:06:03 TOM: WHAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT.

01:06:09 THE BRAMO IS PICKING UP MOHAMED EL-ERIAN WHO WANTS TO JUMP IN.

01:06:14 TO SEE MR. LEE SITTING TO THE RIGHT OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE

01:06:18 UNITED STATES? MOHAMED: WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND MOST

01:06:20 COUNTRIES HAVE A DUAL OPTION APPROACH. THEY RELY ON THE U.S.

01:06:23 FOR NATIONAL SECURITY AND THEY RELY ON CHINA FOR ECONOMIC

01:06:25 PROSPERITY. THE LAST THING THEY WANT IS TO

01:06:28 MAKE A CHOICE. THEY ARE HAPPY TO SEE A

01:06:33 RAPPROCHEMENT BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA.

01:06:37 WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT IS IN THE INTEREST OF BOTH LEADERS.

01:06:42 BOTH LEADERS NEEDED TO BE SEEN DOMESTICALLY AS DOING SOMETHING

01:06:46 THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THEIR LEADERSHIP.

01:06:49 PRESIDENT XI NEEDED IT DESPERATELY.

01:06:51 I AM ENCOURAGED BY WHAT WE SAW BUT I WOULD NOT GET CARRIED

01:06:55 AWAY. JONATHAN: CAN I NAME A FENCE SITTER?

01:06:57 GERMANY. HIS GERMANY HAPPY WITH THIS?

01:07:02 MOHAMED: GERMANY IS HAPPY WITH THIS.

01:07:09 NOBODY WANTS TO MAKE THE CHOICE BETWEEN ALIGNING WITH CHINA OR

01:07:10 THE U.S. AUSTRALIA HAS DISCOVERED THAT

01:07:14 TALK OF NOT GETTING INVOLVED.

01:07:21 JONATHAN: ENEL LOW WEIGHING IN ON THE

01:07:23 MEETING, SAYING THE U.S. WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR

01:07:28 DECOUPLING OR DE-RISKING WITH CHINA TO PROTECT ITS NATIONAL

01:07:31 INTEREST AND CHINA WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH TO DEVELOP A

01:07:37 MULTIPOLAR WORLD AGAINST INTERESTS. TOM:

01:07:44 JOINING US FROM STRATEGAS IS JEANETTE LOWE.

01:07:47 WHAT IS THE NEXT STEP. SHOULD WE LOOK FOR PRESIDENT

01:07:51 BIDEN TO VISIT CHINA? JEANETTE: THAT IS PROBABLY UNLIKELY.

01:07:56 IF WE LOOK AT LAST YEAR WE HAD A MEETING BETWEEN BIDEN AND XI

01:08:02 IN NOVEMBER 2022 AND NOT MUCH OCCURRED OUT OF THAT.

01:08:06 A COUPLE MONTHS LATER WE HAD THE SPY BALLOON FLYING OVER

01:08:08 MONTANA WHICH RUPTURED RELATIONS.

01:08:11 I DO NOT THINK THERE'LL BE A LOT MORE STEPS MOVING FORWARD.

01:08:15 IT IS ALSO INTERESTING TO HAVE THE DEFENSE SECRETARY IN THE

01:08:20 PHILIPPINES TALKING ABOUT CONTINUED COORDINATION WHILE

01:08:23 THIS AIPAC AND THE BIDEN-XI SUMMIT WAS HAPPENING IN SAN

01:08:29 FRANCISCO. THIS WILL BE ABOUT TRYING TO

01:08:33 LOWER THE TEMPERATURE, MAKE SURE WE HAVE CONTINUED

01:08:34 COMMUNICATIONS. XI IS HAVING DOMESTIC ISSUES.

01:08:40 THIS IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM TO HAVE A RESET.

01:08:45 ULTIMATELY I THINK THE TWO SIDES WILL CONTINUE ON THEIR

01:08:47 TRAJECTORIES AND THIS WILL NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL PATH.

01:08:50 IT WILL MAKE THINGS EASIER IN THE SHORT TERM.

01:08:53 WE HAVE AN ELECTION IN THE U.S.. WE DO NOT WANT TO TENSIONS WITH

01:08:56 CHINA. AT THE SAME TIME IF BIDEN WAS

01:09:02 TO BE TOO CONCILIATORY AGAINST CHINA, WE HAVE HAWKS WITHIN

01:09:04 CONGRESS WHO WILL POUNCE ON THAT. MOHAMED:

01:09:08 I VERY MUCH AGREE WITH YOUR ANALYSIS.

01:09:14 HOW IS IT -- HOW EASY IS IT TO DE-RISK WITHOUT DECOUPLING?

01:09:17 JEANETTE: AND THIS IS PART OF THE ISSUE.

01:09:20 THE U.S. HAS BEEN TRYING TO MAKE STRIDES

01:09:22 TO DE-RISK FROM CHINA BUT IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME.

01:09:27 WE ARE QUITE RELIANT ON CHINA FOR SUPPLY CHAINS AND CRITICAL

01:09:30 MINERALS SO IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO MOVE THOSE PIECES

01:09:31 AWAY. I THINK THAT TREND IS IN PLACE.

01:09:36 YOU WILL SEE IT CONTINUE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS BUT

01:09:39 THAT ALSO MEANS TO SOME EXTENT YOU ALMOST NEED A TO TAUNT AT

01:09:45 THE HIGHEST LEVEL SO YOU CAN BUILD THESE PIECES OUT FROM THE

01:09:48 BOTTOM AND ULTIMATELY GET TO THAT DE-RISKING.

01:09:51 I DO NOT THINK DECOUPLING IS WHERE THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS BUT

01:09:54 IT IS ABOUT TRYING TO PROTECT U.S.

01:09:56 NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS AND MAKING SURE THERE IS REDUCED

01:09:58 PENDENCY ON CHINA. YOU ARE SEEING THAT REGARDLESS

01:10:05 OF THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE TO MAKE CHOICES HOW YOU ALIGN WITH

01:10:06 THE U.S. AND CHINA, THERE IS A REALIZATION ACROSS THE GLOBE

01:10:11 THAT HAVING TOO MUCH DEPENDENCY ON CHINA IS NOT A GOOD THING.

01:10:14 MOHAMED: FROM CHINA'S PERSPECTIVE

01:10:20 DE-RISKING INVOLVES BUILDING LITTLE PIPES AROUND THE U.S.

01:10:21 AT THE CORE OF THE SYSTEM. HOW FAR CAN THEY GO INTO

01:10:26 BUILDING AN ALTERNATIVE GLOBAL SYSTEM? JEANETTE:

01:10:30 THIS IS SOMETHING THEY'VE BEEN WORKING ON AND WOULD LIKE TO

01:10:31 CONTINUE TO ACCELERATE. THE ONE THING THAT IS IMPORTANT

01:10:36 IS THE FACT THAT THE U.S. IS NOT DOING THIS ALONE, IT IS

01:10:41 IMPORTANT THEY WILL BE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN TRYING TO MOVE

01:10:45 SUPPLY CHAINS. CHINA WILL BE INVOLVED AND TRY

01:10:48 TO WORK WITH PARTNERS IN ASIA TO GET AROUND SOME OF THOSE

01:10:49 PIECES. THE OTHER THING IS IF YOU LOOK

01:10:56 AT CHINA TRYING TO BUILD THIS MULTI-POLAR WORLD, THEY HAVE

01:10:57 BEEN DOING THAT OVER THE COURSE OF A COUPLE OF YEARS.

01:11:01 THEY ARE TRYING TO MOVE AWAY FROM U.S.

01:11:02 DOLLAR AND GET OTHER COUNTRIES TO DO THE SAME.

01:11:07 IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT CHINA BEING IN A PLACE OF ECONOMIC

01:11:11 WEAKNESS, THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY CONDUCIVE TO THEM

01:11:12 BEING THE LEADER OF THAT MOVEMENT.

01:11:15 THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT HAVE TO BE WORKED OUT ON BOTH

01:11:18 SIDES TO REACH THEIR ULTIMATE GOAL AND THAT IS WHY WE WILL

01:11:24 SEE A MODEL THROUGH SCENARIO WHERE THEY CONTINUE DOWN A PATH.

01:11:28 THERE IS SOME NEED TO BE CONCILIATORY IN THE INTERIM.

01:11:31 TOM: QUICKLY, AND I'VE BEEN GUILTY

01:11:32 OF THIS ALL WEEK. I HAVE TAKEN MY EYE OFF UKRAINE.

01:11:39 UKRAINE IN THIS COLD DECEMBER. WHAT WILL THAT STUDY LOOK LIKE?

01:11:45 JEANETTE: THE U.S. DOES NOT HAVE A LOT OF MILITARY

01:11:49 AID LEFT TO PROVIDE TO UKRAINE AT THE MOMENT UNLESS CONGRESS

01:11:52 APPROPRIATES MORE FUNDING.

01:11:59 THE SPRING OFFENSIVE HAS NOT PRODUCED THE RESULTS BOTH SIDES

01:12:00 WERE LOOKING FOR. WE ARE GOING INTO WINTER, WHICH

01:12:04 MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THERE TO BE PROGRESS ON THE

01:12:08 BATTLEFIELD. I THINK YOU WILL SEE AN EFFORT

01:12:11 IN CONGRESS TO TRY TO COME BACK FROM THE THANKSGIVING HOLIDAY

01:12:16 AND PASS BIDEN'S NATIONAL SECURITY SUPPLEMENTAL WHICH

01:12:18 WOULD PROVIDE AID FOR UKRAINE AS WELL AS ISRAEL AND TAIWAN,

01:12:20 BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THEY ARE TRYING TO FIND A SOLUTION ON.

01:12:25 THEY NEED TO FIGURE OUT IF THEY CAN FIND BORDER POLICY CHANGES

01:12:27 TO GET REPUBLICAN SUPPORT FOR THAT BILL.

01:12:30 IF WE DON'T GET AID TO UKRAINE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS

01:12:37 THERE IS GOING TO BE A STRONG HOLE PUT INTO UKRAINE'S

01:12:40 DEFENSES BECAUSE THEY DO NEED MORE MONEY.

01:12:43 YOU HAVE EUROPE ALSO SUPPORTING THEM BUT EUROPE HAS BEEN

01:12:48 STRUGGLING TO GET AID PACKAGES PAST. IT HAS BEEN PUT ON THE

01:12:54 BACK BURNER BUT YOU MIGHT START TO SEE MORE DISCUSSION OVER THE

01:12:56 NEXT MONTH IN CONGRESS. JONATHAN:

01:12:59 THIS IS THE FIGHT WE WILL SEE GOING INTO THE NEW YEAR.

01:13:03 WE TALKED ABOUT THE NATIONSTATES THAT WERE SITTING

01:13:05 ON THE FENCE TRYING TO MAINTAIN A RELATIONSHIP IN BOTH SPHERES,

01:13:08 CHINA AND THE U.S.. CAN WE TALK ABOUT CORPORATE

01:13:11 AMERICA.

01:13:18 PLEASE PROGRESSIVE CONSUMER BASES IN THE UNITED STATES AND

01:13:20 AT THE SAME TIME APPEASE FOREIGN DICTATORSHIPS.

01:13:22 HOW WILL THAT GO? MOHAMED: IT IS EASIER FOR A COUNTRY TO

01:13:28 BE A POLITICAL SWING STATE AS JARED COHEN CALL IT THAT A

01:13:33 CORPORATION. IF I WAS SITTING A BOARD I

01:13:37 WOULD CAUTION AGAINST INVESTING TOO MUCH INTO CHINA. JONATHAN:

01:13:40 AND THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE SEEN OVER THE LAST YEAR WHICH IS WHY

01:13:42 YOU SEE IT IN THE DATA. TOM: NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.

01:13:48 JONATHAN:

01:14:09 JONATHAN:

01:14:15 SO FAR SO GOOD. EQUITIES UP .2 PERCENT.

01:14:21 THIRD WEEK OF GAINS ON THE S&P. LONGEST RUN SINCE THE SUMMER.

01:14:28 SMALL CAPS ON THE RUSSELL 2000 UP A LITTLE BIT.

01:14:32 BEFORE ENTERING RECESSION THIS IS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY, "THEIR

01:14:38 SHARE OF COMPANIES IN THE RUSSELL 2000 WITH NO EARNINGS

01:14:39 IS AT 40%." THAT IS TORSTEN SLOK OVER AT

01:14:43 APOLLO. TOM: IT DRIVES ME NUTS WHEN THEY SAY

01:14:50 THIS IS ABOUT APPLE, I AM DRESSED LIKE DAN IVES SO I HAVE

01:14:51 TO BE CAREFUL. YOU RUN A COMPANY FOR GROWTH AT

01:14:55 THE TOP LINE OR A COMPANY FOR GROWTH DOWN THE INCOME

01:14:57 STATEMENT? JONATHAN:

01:15:03 IT IS DIFFICULT GOING INTO NEXT YEAR, THAT IS FOR SURE.

01:15:07 IF WE GET AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN WHAT TO THE NUMBERS LOOK LIKE

01:15:08 IN 12 MONTHS? TOM: I THINK BY THE MIDDLE OF

01:15:15 JANUARY I WILL BE ABLE TO ANNOUNCE THAT MY THEME FOR 2024

01:15:18 IS THE SUSTAINING OF THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN.

01:15:20 I THINK THAT IS WHERE WE ARE HEADING. JONATHAN:

01:15:23 LET'S TURN TO THE BOND MARKET. TWO YEAR, 10 YEAR, 30 YEAR.

01:15:30 YIELDS LOWER IN A BIG WAY FROM WHERE WE WERE LAST MONTH.

01:15:35 WE HAVE GONE FROM JUST ABOVE 4.40 ON THE 10 YEAR, DOWN TWO

01:15:38 OR THREE BASIS POINTS. TONS OF FEEDBACK ABOUT THE

01:15:44 CONSORTIUM WE ARE PUTTING TOGETHER BY MOHAMED EL-ERIAN'S

01:15:46 QUEEN PARK RANGERS AS THEY SUPPORT THE IDEA OF US PUTTING

01:15:51 FORWARD A CONSORTIUM. TOM:

01:16:00 THANKSGIVING, NORWICH'S ROUTE LIKE WHERE THE PILGRIMS CAME

01:16:03 FROM, THEY ARE PLAYING AT NORWICH, WE COULD GO AND FEEL

01:16:05 THE PILGRIM EXPERIENCE. JONATHAN:

01:16:10 OPRAH PIMCO, NORWICH IS HIS SIDE. MOHAMED:

01:16:13 HE GOES TO EVERY GAME. JONATHAN: USED TO BE CHAIRMAN. TOM:

01:16:19 YOU GO AND START A RUMOR. HENRY WINTER WILL PICK IT UP.

01:16:23 JONATHAN: EUROZONE INFLATION, FINAL READ

01:16:27 FOR OCTOBER CAME OUT WITH A TWO HANDLE. 108.65.

01:16:33 LET'S GET YOU COMPANY STORIES.

01:16:35 DISNEY CEO BOB IGER PLANNING TO ADDRESS EMPLOYEES IN A

01:16:40 COMPANYWIDE WIDE TOWN HALL AFTER THANKSGIVING.

01:16:43 A NUMBER OF SENIOR EXECUTIVES INCLUDING THE HEADS OF FILM,

01:16:47 TV, AND PART DIVISIONS ARE EXPECTED TO JOIN THE DISCUSSION.

01:16:51 THE MEDIA GIANT HAS BEEN BATTLING ACTIVIST INVESTORS AND

01:16:54 STRUGGLING TO ADAPT TO A CHANGE IN VIEWING HABITS OF CONSUMERS

01:16:59 CUT THE CABLE CORDS IN FAVOR OF STREAMING.

01:17:01 IT IS MESSY AT DISNEY. IT FEELS LIKE THINGS ARE FOR

01:17:04 SALE. ABC, ESPN.

01:17:12 TOM: EVERY OUT OF DUKE AND QUITE SKILLED AT VALUE.

01:17:16 HE WILL NOT YELL AND SCREAM AND GET UP ON THE TABLE.

01:17:19 IT WILL BE A GOVERNANCE MISSION BY THESE ACTIVISTS SHAREHOLDERS

01:17:22 STIRRING THE PART. I WOULD SUGGEST THEY ARE

01:17:28 GETTING THEM FORWARD IN A TOPOLOGY THAT IS NOT IDENTIFIED

01:17:31 PROFIT -- IN A TECHNOLOGY THAT IS NOT IDENTIFIED PROFIT YET

01:17:34 WITH THE EXCEPTION OF NETFLIX.

01:17:41 GM APPROVING AN ORAL -- APPROVING A NEW 4.5 YEAR

01:17:43 CONTRACT ENDING A MONTHS LONG BARGAINING PROCESS.

01:17:48 THE HISTORIC DEAL WILL SEE BASE WAGES INCREASED 25% OVER THE

01:17:52 LIFE OF THE CONTRACT, THE RETURN OF COST-OF-LIVING

01:17:54 ADJUSTMENTS, AND THE ABILITY TO STRIKE OVER PLANNED CLOSURES.

01:18:00 AT CHRYSLER AND STELLANTIS WORKERS SUPPORT THE AGREEMENT

01:18:02 BY WIDER MARGINS THAN GENERAL MOTORS. 25%.

01:18:07 WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR WEEKS.

01:18:10 YOU LOOK AT THE SITUATION AS THE DYING EMBERS OF A HOT LABOR

01:18:15 MARKET OR IS THIS A SIGN AS TO WHAT MIGHT BE IN STORE FOR US

01:18:16 AROUND THE CORNER? MOHAMED: I THINK IT IS THE LATTER.

01:18:21 WE ARE FINALLY SEEING LABOR GETTING MORE POWER RELATIVE TO

01:18:26 CAPITAL AND THAT REVERSES DECADES OF CAPITAL DOMINATING.

01:18:30 I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT SHIFT AND DOES CHANGE THE

01:18:36 STRUCTURE OF THE LABOR MARKET AND YOU WILL SEE OTHER

01:18:37 AGREEMENTS FOLLOW THIS ONE.

01:18:43 TOM: CAN WAGE GAINS ON A REAL BASIS

01:18:46 MOVE OUTSIDE THE UNION DEBATE? MOHAMED:

01:18:49 I THINK THEY ARE ALREADY DOING THAT. TOM:

01:18:52 YOU CALLED ME JOHN AGAIN. SEE HOW HE DOES THAT? JONATHAN:

01:18:57 HE WILL NEVER COME BACK. TOM: BILL, CONTINUE. MOHAMED:

01:19:02 I AM SPEECHLESS. I WOULD LOVE TO BE CALLED JOHN.

01:19:07 IT WOULD BE THE BIGGEST COMPLIMENT. JONATHAN:

01:19:09 THANK YOU SO MUCH. TOM: HONDA WILL LIFT WAGES 9% OFF OF

01:19:14 THE UAW. MOHAMED: I HAVE NEVER SEEN YOU BLUSH

01:19:18 BEFORE, TOM. TOM: IT IS THE MAKEUP. JONATHAN:

01:19:24 LET'S TURN TO ANOTHER STORY. IBM ANNOUNCING IT IS SUSPENDING

01:19:32 ITS ADVERTISING ON X, THE PLATFORM FORMERLY CALLED

01:19:35 TWITTER COME AFTER THEIR ADS WERE SPOTTED NEXT TO PRO NAZI

01:19:40 POSTS ON THE SITE, DAY AFTER ELON MUSK ENDORSED AN

01:19:43 ANTI-SEMITIC POST TARGETING THE ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE.

01:19:47 THE INCIDENT PROMPTING OUTRAGE FROM AN INVESTOR AT TESLA.

01:19:51 THE ELECTRIC CAR COMPANY FOLLOWING 4%.

01:19:53 WHERE TO BEGIN WITH THIS? TOM: IS A REALLY DELICATE QUESTION.

01:19:59 WITH IMMENSE RESPECT TO THE CAREER OF MOHAMED EL-ERIAN WHO

01:20:02 HAS PROSPERED IN BUSINESS. TWO PEOPLE START THINKING

01:20:05 DIFFERENTLY WHEN THEY HAVE A LOT OF MONEY?

01:20:09 ELON MUSK HAS A TON OF MONEY.

01:20:15 RICHEST GUY IN THE WORLD, ONE OF.

01:20:16 TO THEY THINK DIFFERENTLY THAN WE DO? MOHAMED:

01:20:19 I THINK THEY BELIEVE THEY CAN CONTROL ANY NARRATIVE AND THEY

01:20:26 ARE SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE WHO REINFORCE THAT. TOM:

01:20:29 ON A SECOND BY SECOND BASIS. JONATHAN:

01:20:33 THE BUSINESS DAMAGE IT COULD DO TO X, IMB TAKING A STEP BACK,

01:20:39 AND THEN YOU HAVE THE BRAND DAMAGE YOU DO TO TESLA, NEVER

01:20:45 MIND THE INVESTORS, WHAT ABOUT BEING ASSOCIATED WITH THAT

01:20:48 BRAND GIVEN YOU KNOW THAT BRAND IS SO CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH

01:20:49 ELON MUSK. THOSE KIND OF COMMENTS, I DO

01:20:53 NOT KNOW WHERE THAT IS. TOM: THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER,

01:20:59 HOW DOES SHE RESPOND TO THIS PROFESSIONALLY AND PERSONALLY?

01:21:02 JONATHAN: DO YOU GET THE FEELING LINDA IS

01:21:04 RUNNING THAT COMPANY? TOM: I DO NOT THINK ANYBODY IS

01:21:08 RUNNING ELON MUSK AT ELON MUSK. I DO NOT THINK I AM

01:21:11 EDITORIALIZING. JONATHAN: I AM RIGHT THERE WITH YOU. TOM:

01:21:18 IT IS FASCINATING AND IT SPEAKS TO DAVOS, THE FANCY AND THE

01:21:22 GREAT AND WORTHY ARE NOT RUNNING AROUND MAKING ELON MUSK

01:21:25 COMMENTS. JONATHAN: DABO'S NEEDS TO GET REAL.

01:21:28 THIS ESTABLISHMENT NONSENSE. THEY TALK ABOUT DIVERSITY.

01:21:35 THEY DEALS -- THEY NEED SOME REAL DIVERSITY OF THOUGHT. TOM:

01:21:39 WE CAN DO AN HOUR THERE ON FORMULA ONE RACING.

01:21:45 JONATHAN: TOTO IS JUST A BUSINESS GUY.

01:21:48 DID YOU SEE HIS REACTION TO THE MESS IN LAS VEGAS? TOM:

01:21:51 IS ALSO AN ACADEMIC. HE LECTURES AT HARVARD.

01:21:56 HE HAS A REAL CARE ABOUT THE ACADEMICS. MOHAMED:

01:21:58 HE REALLY DOES. TOM:

01:22:04 JOINING US IS THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER OF FIXED

01:22:07 INCOME AT FRANKLIN TEMPLETON, SHE HAS SURVIVED 2023.

01:22:11 WILL YOU CLIP THE COUPON LIKE BILL GROSS DID OR CAN YOU FIND

01:22:16 TOTAL RETURN AND FIXED INCOME NEXT YEAR?

01:22:20 >> I THINK NEXT YEAR WILL BE MORE DIFFICULT.

01:22:22 YOU ARE GETTING THE INCOME. I DO NOT BUY THE RATE CUTS THAT

01:22:26 THE MARKET IS PRICING IN. RIGHT NOW MARKET SURPRISED

01:22:31 BEYOND THE PERFECT LANDING, RIGHT? JONATHAN:

01:22:36 GIVEN THAT, WHAT IS YOUR CALL ON THE BOND MARKET?

01:22:39 WE HAVE HAD THE CORRECTION DOWN TO 4.30 RIGHT NOW.

01:22:42 WHAT IS THE CALL NOW?

01:22:47 >> IT HAS BEEN TOO FAST. I DO NOT THINK IT IS UNDERPINNED BY

01:22:48 FUNDAMENTALS. I THINK CLOSER TO FIVE IS

01:22:52 CLOSER TO WHERE THE BOND MARKET NEEDS TO BE.

01:22:57 DOES IT HAPPEN IN NEXT WEEK OR TWO WEEKS? MAYBE NOT.

01:23:05 THE REALITY IS THE FED TALKED ABOUT FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND

01:23:10 HAS STOPPED, BECAUSE AT EVERY LEVEL, INCLUDING WHAT WE ARE

01:23:12 HEARING IN TERMS OF WAGE AGREEMENTS, AT EVERY LEVEL, I

01:23:17 THINK THERE ARE REMAINING RISKS TO INFLATION AND WHILE I THINK

01:23:22 THE FED WILL CERTAINLY HAS A LOT OF DATA SUPPORTING THE FED

01:23:27 REMAINING ON PAUSE, THERE IS DATA SUPPORTING THE PACE OF

01:23:29 RATE CUTS NEXT YEAR THAT THE MARKET IS PRICING IN RIGHT NOW.

01:23:33 THAT IS THE PART WHICH IS UNLIKELY TO MATERIALIZE.

01:23:37 MOHAMED: LET'S GET YOUR VIEW ON FLOWS.

01:23:40 A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WAITING FOR THE EXTENSION TRADE.

01:23:44 PEOPLE GOING FROM THE FRONT END TO LOCKING IN HIGHER YIELDS FOR

01:23:46 LONGER. HAVE YIELDS MOVED DOWN TOO

01:23:53 QUICKLY FOR THE EXTENSION TRADE OR IS THE MOVE DOWN

01:23:54 ACCELERATING THE EXTENSION TRADE?

01:24:02 >> RIGHT NOW WE CONTINUE TO SEE -- I THINK THE SPEED HAS BEEN

01:24:03 TOO MUCH. I THINK -- I DO NOT THINK THIS

01:24:10 IS THE REAL EXTENSION TRADE YET. I THINK IT WAS TOO FAST. WE

01:24:16 WILL SEE MOVEMENT TO THE TEAM.

01:24:24 IT IS MUCH MORE OF A FEAR OF MISSING OUT.

01:24:31 YOU ARE SEEING HIGH-YIELD RALLY TO 3.75.

01:24:34 YESTERDAY IT WAS THE 30% CHANCE OF RATE CUTS BEGINNING IN MARCH.

01:24:40 IF YOU NEEDED THAT KIND OF NARRATIVE TO SUPPORT THESE

01:24:43 RATES, I DO NOT THINK THAT IS REALISTIC.

01:24:48 AS THOSE RATES CUTS START GETTING PRICED OUT I EXPECT

01:24:49 YIELDS TO START MOVING UP.

01:24:55 THERE IS A LAST PIECE ON FLOWS WHICH IS THE FISCAL DEFICIT,

01:24:57 THE FACT THAT THE NEXT THREE MONTHS OR SIX MONTHS THAT

01:25:01 STARTS MOVING AND WE WILL SEE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT LEAVE THE

01:25:05 LONG END OF THE YIELD CURVE SO THERE ARE MANY REASONS NOT TO

01:25:13 FEEL THAT THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THAT SERIOUS RALLY. MOHAMED:

01:25:19 WHEN YOU SAID THIS IS WELL BEYOND A SOFT LANDING WAS YOUR

01:25:25 PHRASE, TELL US, WHAT IS THE CATALYST FOR CHANGING THE

01:25:28 DYNAMICS THE WAY YOU THINK THEY WILL CHANGE?

01:25:30 WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? WHAT WILL BE THE CATALYST?

01:25:36 >> NOT HAVING A SOFT LANDING OR SEEING A SOFT LANDING? MOHAMED:

01:25:40 FORESEEING REALITY GET BACK INTO THE BOND MARKET?

01:25:48 >> I THINK THE DATA, THE FED IS TRYING TO DO WHAT IT CAN DO IN

01:25:52 TERMS OF SAYING RATE HIKES ARE NOT OFF THE TABLE.

01:25:57 CERTAINLY THE S&P MIGHT PLAY A ROLE BUT IT IS NOT CLEAR THEY

01:26:00 WILL CONTINUE TO CALL FOR LOW RATE CUTS.

01:26:03 THE QUANTITY OF RATE CUTS THE MARKET IS PRICING, I THINK

01:26:07 THOSE START GETTING PRICED OUT AND I DO NOT THINK WE ARE

01:26:13 SEEING GOOD DATA POINT.

01:26:19 WE ARE NOT GETTING A SUSTAINED -- THE MOVE DOES NOT COME AS

01:26:24 QUICKLY AND AS SMOOTHLY AS MARKET SENTIMENT IS

01:26:28 ANTICIPATING , PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF THESE WAGE INCREASES.

01:26:33 POLICY REMAINS QUITE EXPANSIONARY.

01:26:36 MOST OF THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT EMPLOYMENT HAS NOT EVEN

01:26:37 HAPPENED. WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEE SUPPORT

01:26:41 FROM THAT INTO NEXT YEAR. JONATHAN: APPRECIATE THE UPDATE.

01:26:49 ON THIS BOND MARKET MAY BE GETTING TOO HAPPY WITH ITSELF

01:26:50 ON THE PROSPECTS OF A SOFT LANDING.

01:26:52 EQUITIES LOOK LIKE THIS. POSITIVE .3%.

01:26:57 YIELDS LOWER THREE BASIS POINTS. THE TURNAROUND HAS BEEN AMAZING.

01:27:01 I WANT TO GO BACK TO SOMETHING WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER.

01:27:05 WE HAVE BEEN CONDITIONED BY HAVING BIG SHARKS SEEK OUT THE

01:27:08 FED RESPONSE TO BIG SHARKS. WHAT IS MISSING OF SOME OF THE

01:27:12 CUTS OF 2019. THE FED IS CAPABLE OF MOVING 75

01:27:18 BASIS POINTS UNDER CHAIR POWELL WITHOUT GOING ALL THE WAY BACK

01:27:19 DOWN. MOHAMED:

01:27:25 GO BACK TO MARY DALY'S FTP WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER TODAY.

01:27:29 THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT REPEATING THE MISTAKE OF THE

01:27:30 1970'S. THEY DO NOT WANT THIS STOP GO

01:27:33 PROCESS. I THINK THE HURDLE FOR RATE

01:27:37 CUTS IS MUCH HIGHER THAN WHAT THE MARKET THINKS IT IS.

01:27:41 JONATHAN: GIVEN THE COMMUNICATION WE HAVE

01:27:45 HAD, THE BIGGEST RISK, IS IT THAT THEY DO NOT GO FAR ENOUGH

01:27:47 WHERE THEY GO TOO FAR? IS IT THEY GO TOO FAR? MOHAMED:

01:27:52 I THINK THAT IS THE BIGGEST RISK RIGHT NOW. JONATHAN:

01:27:56 THAT IS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE. TOM: I TALKED ABOUT THIS AT LENGTH.

01:28:02 IS THERE AN OPERATIVE THEORY RIGHT NOW IN THE NEW MEASURED

01:28:03 APPROACH? MOHAMED: NO. IF THERE WAS THEY WOULD NOT

01:28:08 REPEAT DATA DEPENDENCY. THIS IS A FED WITH VERY LITTLE

01:28:12 STRATEGIC VISION. JONATHAN: HOLD THAT THOUGHT.

01:28:16 WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT IN THE NEXT SEGMENT.

01:28:19 FINAL SEGMENT WITH MOHAMED EL-ERIAN IN NEW YORK CITY.

01:28:21 THIS WAS FUN.

01:28:40 >> WHAT IS MORE LIKELY IS A ROCKY LANDING WHERE INFLATION

01:28:41 STAYS STUCK AT THREE AND RATES STAY HIGH.

01:28:44 THERE IS SOME SLOW DOWN AND IT IS A MALAISE, A SINGLE-DIGIT

01:28:48 EQUITY ENVIRONMENT WITH A REAL RISK THAT SOMETHING BREAKS.

01:28:53 IT IS BETWEEN THAT ROCKY LANDING AND A CLASSIC RECESSION

01:28:57 BREAK WE THINK IS MOST LIKELY TO HAPPEN. JONATHAN:

01:28:59 THAT IS A NEW ONE. ROCKY LANDING.

01:29:03 ROCKY LANDING, CLASSIC RECESSION.

01:29:07 STEVE CHEVRON EARLIER ON TODAY. FINAL THOUGHTS WITH MOHAMED

01:29:12 EL-ERIAN COMING RIGHT UP. LET ME GET YOU A THOUGHT FROM

01:29:15 CITI.

01:29:22 "THE REALITY IS LESS PLEASANT. RISING INITIAL AND CONTINUING

01:29:27 JOBLESS CLAIMS MAY BE ASSIGNED ACTIVITY IS SLOWING AND

01:29:32 UNDERLYING INFLATION STUCK ABOVE 3% WILL CONSTRAIN THE FED

01:29:37 FROM ACTING PREEMPTIVELY TO AVOID OF GROWTH SLOWDOWN."

01:29:41 THAT IS HOW THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT 2024. TOM:

01:29:44 MOHAMED EL-ERIAN OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE IN

01:29:47 WRITING SO MUCH TO HELP US WITH OUR CLEAR THINKING ON THESE

01:29:48 MATTERS. THE NEXT STRATEGIC THEORY AND

01:29:53 WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. I SUGGEST THE ANALOGS WE HAVE

01:30:00 OF THE PAST ARE HUGELY FAULTED INCLUDING THE ANALOG OF JEROME

01:30:02 POWELL IN COMPARISON TO PAUL VOLCKER.

01:30:05 HOW DO WE GET RID OF OUR ANCIENT ANALOGS TO GET TO OUR

01:30:10 NEXT STRATEGIC THEORY? MOHAMED: THE ONE THING WE NEED TO DO

01:30:16 MORE OF HIS LISTEN TO THE CORPORATE EARNINGS CALLS.

01:30:21 THE REASON WHY THEY MISSED THE INFLATION CALL AND GOT STUCK ON

01:30:24 THIS NOTION IT WILL GO AWAY QUICKLY IS BECAUSE THEY WERE

01:30:27 NOT LISTENING TO COMPANY AFTER COMPANY SAYING COSTS ARE GOING

01:30:30 UP AND THEY BELIEVE THEY CAN PASS IT ON BECAUSE DEMAND IS

01:30:31 STRONG. TODAY MOST COMPANIES ARE TELLING YOU DEMAND IS SOFTENING

01:30:36 QUICKLY. WE HAVE HEARD THIS AT THE HIGH

01:30:41 END AND AT THE LOW END.

01:30:48 YOU HAVE TO BE MORE FORWARD-LOOKING AND STOP

01:30:52 RELYING ON DATA NUMBERS. THIS EXCESSIVE DATA DEPENDENCY

01:30:57 WILL GET US INTO A ANOTHER PROBLEM.

01:31:05 TOM: THE GREAT STEPHANIE KELTON WILL

01:31:07 JOIN US LATER ON TODAY. HAVE WE CONFLATED MONETARY AND

01:31:11 FISCAL POLICY? ALAN GREENSPAN FOUGHT THAT DAY

01:31:14 AFTER DAY. HIS JEROME POWELL PROSECUTING

01:31:19 FISCAL THEORY? MOHAMED:

01:31:26 WHEN THE FED WAS PURSUING QE THEY ENABLE LARGER AND LARGER

01:31:29 DEFICITS AND THEY ENABLED EXCESSIVE RISK-TAKING, THEY

01:31:33 ENABLED ALL SORTS OF THINGS BUT THEY DID NOT WANT TO DO THAT.

01:31:37 THAT IS JUST AN UNPLEASANT CONSEQUENCE OF SOMETHING THEY

01:31:38 HAD TO DO. I DON'T THINK SO. I DO NOT BUY THE FISCAL

01:31:43 DOMINANCE ARGUMENT. I DO THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE

01:31:48 FISCAL SIDE YOU COULD HAVE A SITUATION WHERE YIELDS STAY

01:31:51 HIGHER IN INFLATION STAYS HIGHER DESPITE THE FACT THE

01:31:54 ECONOMY IS WEAKENING FASTER THAN PEOPLE ANTICIPATED. TOM:

01:31:59 -- JONATHAN: YOU HAVE BEEN CRITICAL OF THIS

01:32:01 FEDERAL RESERVE AND YOU MENTIONED THE LACK OF A

01:32:05 STRATEGIC THEORY. FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT READ THE

01:32:08 PIECES, WHAT DO YOU MEAN, HOW WOULD THE FEDERAL RESERVE

01:32:11 CHANGE IN THE LEADERSHIP OF IT IF THEY DEVELOPED A STRATEGIC

01:32:12 THEORY? MOHAMED: LOOK WHAT HAPPENED IN THE LAST

01:32:15 MONTH. CHAIR POWELL CAME OUT AND SAID

01:32:20 SOMETHING ENCOURAGING, HE SAID WE ARE SEEING MORE SUPPLY

01:32:23 COMING INTO THE ECONOMY. THE MARKET LOVED THAT BECAUSE

01:32:27 THAT IS A SOLUTION TO A SOLUTION TO A LOT OF OUR

01:32:31 PROBLEMS. IF WE CAN ENHANCE THE SUPPLY SIDE YOU GET MORE GROWTH

01:32:33 AND REDUCE INFLATION. THE VERY NEXT SPEECH, HE STEPS

01:32:38 AWAY FROM THAT. THE VERY NEXT SPEECH.

01:32:44 IT CONFUSES PEOPLE. ARE WE LOOKING IN A WORLD IN

01:32:47 WHICH SUPPLY-SIDE IS GETTING MORE FLEXIBLE OR ARE WE NOT

01:32:51 LOOKING IN A WORLD IN WHICH SUPPLY-SIDE IS MORE FLEXIBLE?

01:32:54 THE FED HAS TO BE MORE CONSISTENT AND HOW IT BELIEVES

01:32:58 THE ECONOMY WILL EVOLVE. THAT IS WHAT CENTRAL BANKERS DO.

01:33:01 THAT IS WHAT GREENSPAN DID. THEY DID NOT JUST REPEAT WE ARE

01:33:05 DATA-DEPENDENT. JONATHAN: THEY WERE CONSISTENTLY WRONG

01:33:10 COMING OUT OF THE PANDEMIC. THEY HAD A STRATEGIC THEORY BUT

01:33:13 IT WAS THE WRONG ONE OR TOOK LONGER TO PLAY OUT THAN THEY

01:33:16 THOUGHT THEY WOULD. HAVEN'T THEY BEEN BURNED BY

01:33:19 THAT? MOHAMED: IT MAY BE.

01:33:25 I CANNOT GET INTO THEIR HEADS. IT MAY WELL BE THAT IS THE CASE.

01:33:30 WHEN YOU ARE WRONG, THE ANSWER IS TO STEP BACK AND TRY TO

01:33:32 FIGURE OUT.

01:33:38 WE HAVE HAD FAILURES OF COMMUNICATION, ANALYSIS,

01:33:41 ACTION, SUPERVISION, AND ACCOUNTABILITY. TOM:

01:33:47 I GO TO ALAN MELTZER ON THIS. I HAVE MENTIONED THIS MANY

01:33:50 TIMES BEFORE. YOU HAVE TO AGGREGATE

01:33:52 STATISTICS. THAT IS WHAT WE DID IN 1947.

01:33:58 CAN WE HAVE AN AGGREGATE A STRATEGIC VISION FOR A FED OR

01:34:03 DO WE HAVE JOHN EDWARDS TWO AMERICAS OR THREE AMERICA'S

01:34:06 WHERE WE CANNOT HAVE AN AGGREGATE ECONOMIC VISION?

01:34:08 MOHAMED: THE MANDATE IS SUCH THAT THEY

01:34:12 HAVE TO HAVE AN AGGREGATE VIEW. WHEN IT COMES TO DISTRIBUTION

01:34:17 ISSUES, WHICH ARE REALLY IMPORTANT, THE AMOUNT OF

01:34:19 INEQUALITY IN THE U.S. TODAY IS EXCESSIVE.

01:34:22 THAT IS THE FISCAL SIDE. THE FED CAN HAVE A VIEW THAT IT

01:34:26 NEEDS TO BE AN AGGREGATE OF VIEW. JONATHAN:

01:34:31 I LOOK AT -- TOM: I LOOK AT THE WONDERFUL BOOK

01:34:34 OUT NOW ON INEQUALITY AND THE HEART OF THE MATTER IS THE

01:34:37 INEQUALITY JEROME POWELL HAS TO PROSECUTE IS EXTRAORDINARY.

01:34:40 THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO PUT IT. MOHAMED:

01:34:45 IT IS NOT JUST A SOCIAL AND POLITICAL ISSUE, IT IS ALSO AN

01:34:47 ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ISSUE. TOM:

01:34:53 HOW DID THE HAVES GET THE TRUST BACK OF THE HAVE-NOTS? MOHAMED:

01:34:58 BY SHOWING THEY CARE ABOUT INEQUALITY.

01:35:00 YOU CANNOT BE A CONSISTENTLY GOOD HOUSE AND A WEAKENING

01:35:03 NEIGHBORHOOD. JONATHAN: TRUST IS SHATTERED OF THE

01:35:06 ESTABLISHMENT. WHAT YOU ARE REALLY ASKING IS

01:35:11 HOW CAN THE PEOPLE TRUST THE ESTABLISHMENT GIVEN WHAT

01:35:13 HAPPENED WITH THE PANDEMIC, COMING OUT OF THE PANDEMIC?

01:35:17 WE HAVE AN MINISTRATION THAT CLAIMS THEY CARE ABOUT THESE

01:35:19 THINGS AND YET WHEN YOU GO THROUGH THE POLLING THE TRUST

01:35:23 IS NOT THERE, THE TRUST IN THEIR ABILITY TO DELIVER IS NOT

01:35:24 THERE. MOHAMED: WHEN WE LOOK BACK WE WILL LOOK

01:35:30 AT THIS ADMINISTRATION AS HAVING DELIVERED AN AMAZING

01:35:32 NUMBER OF JOBS AND HAVING HELPED PIVOT THE ECONOMY TO A

01:35:35 NEW GROWTH MODEL, BUT IT IS BEING JUDGED ON INFLATION.

01:35:39 INFLATION IS PROBLEMATIC. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT INFLATION

01:35:44 COMING DOWN, THE PUBLIC BELIEVES INFLATION COMING DOWN

01:35:46 MEANS PRICES COMING DOWN. THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND THAT

01:35:51 INFLATION COMING DOWN MEANS PRICES ARE GOING UP AT A SLOWER

01:35:54 RATE AND WHY DO THEY NOT UNDERSTAND THAT?

01:35:56 THEY ARE GETTING POORER. THE IRONY IS THE FED SLIPPAGE

01:36:03 ON INFLATION HAS SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERMINED THE TRUST PEOPLE

01:36:06 HAVE IN THE ADMINISTRATION, EVEN THOUGH THE ADMINISTRATION

01:36:07 HAS LARGELY DELIVERED ON WHAT IT SAID IT WOULD DO. JONATHAN:

01:36:12 DON'T YOU THINK WE NEED TO CHANGE HOW WE TALK ABOUT THE

01:36:13 ECONOMY? THE ELECTORATE FEELS WHAT

01:36:18 ISRAEL IS PRICES ARE HIGHER THAN THEY WERE PRE-PANDEMIC

01:36:21 VERSUS NOW AND WE TALK ABOUT THIS MONTH OVER MONTH STAFF,

01:36:27 THIS REAL OVER REELS -- THIS YEAR-OVER-YEAR STUFF AND IT

01:36:29 DOES NOT REGISTER FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE BECAUSE THAT IS NOT HOW

01:36:30 IT WORKS. WHEN WE SIT HERE AND STRIP OUT

01:36:35 FOOD AND ENERGY, A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK WAIT A SECOND,

01:36:39 WHERE WILL I LIVE, HOW WILL I FEED MYSELF? MOHAMED:

01:36:47 A FEW DAYS AGO I TWEETED -- I PUT ON MY SOCIAL MEDIA

01:36:49 PLATFORMS OF GRAFT FROM THE WALL STREET JOURNAL THAT SHOWED

01:36:55 THE ABSOLUTE LEVEL OF PRICES OF CERTAIN THINGS.

01:36:59 FOOD, GASOLINE, AND HOUSING. THAT IS REALITY. TOM:

01:37:04 THAT IS THE CUMULATIVE. OUR AUDIENCE IS THINKING HE

01:37:09 LIVE INFLATION AND THE BOWTIES ARE SAYING MONTH OVER MONTH.

01:37:11 JONATHAN: THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE LIVING.

01:37:15 MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, THIS WAS GREAT. A PLEASURE.

01:37:19 TWO HOURS GONE JUST LIKE THAT. TOM: A TOUGH SCHEDULE. MOHAMED:

01:37:28 THE FACT THAT WE ARE 4-5 AND THE PATRIOTS ARE 2-8 IS ALL WE

01:37:32 HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT. JONATHAN:

01:37:38 AT THE START OF THE SEASON MOHAMED EL-ERIAN DID NOT WANT

01:37:39 THIS TRAIT. HE WILL COME BACK AT THE END OF

01:37:42 THE SEASON. MOHAMED: I THINK HE IS TRYING BUT MOST

01:37:47 PEOPLE ARE TELLING HIM TO NOT RUSH IT. TOM:

01:37:56 IF THE HESS FAMILY SELLS OUT TO CHEVRON, IS THIS ANOTHER

01:37:57 OPPORTUNITY? YOU COULD BE SOME PREMIER

01:38:00 LEAGUE TIGHTEN. JONATHAN: I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT WOODY

01:38:06 JOHNSON WATCHES THIS PROGRAM. TOM: AMBASSADOR JOHNSON?

01:38:12 MOHAMED: AMBASSADOR JOHNSON REALLY CARES

01:38:13 ABOUT THE JETS. TOM:

01:38:19 WE DID NOT HAVE TIME TODAY. I WANT TO TALK TO ABOUT EGYPT,

01:38:24 WHICH IN ROBERT KAPLAN'S THE LOOM OF TIME IS THE PIVOT.

01:38:27 MOHAMED: I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.

01:38:33 JONATHAN: COMING UP WE'LL CATCH UP WITH

01:38:36 DAVID OF UBS GLOBAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT.

01:38:40 HEADING TOWARDS THE THIRD WEEK OF GAINS ON THE S&P.

01:38:57 >> THE FED IS DONE RAISING RATES.

01:39:00 THAT PART OF THE PROCESS IS COMPLETE.

01:39:02 >> IS THE FED DONE? THE MARKETS HAVE DRAWN THAT

01:39:05 CONCLUSION.

01:39:09 >> THIS IS THE SOFTEST IN THE LABOR MARKET WE NEEDED IT IT

01:39:12 TAKES PRESSURE OFF THE FED TO RAISE RATES.

01:39:15 >> THE FED IS HESITANT. IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE CUTS ARE

01:39:18 FORTHCOMING.

01:39:20 >> THE FED WILL BE PATIENT BUT I DON'T THINK THIS IS A VICTORY.

01:39:25 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE WITH TOM KEENE,

01:39:27 JONATHAN FERRO AND YOU SO BRAVO IT'S. TOM: GOOD MORNING.

01:39:35 ABRAMOWITZ REFRIGERATOR SHOPPING.

01:39:40 LOOKING AT EQUITIES AND THE YIELD SPACE.

01:39:47 THE 10 YEAR REAL YIELD BREAKS DOWN TO 2.1%.

01:39:52 CAN YOU IMAGINE A ONE POINT 99% INFLATION-ADJUSTED YIELD? JON:

01:39:54 IT'S BEEN AMAZING. LET'S GO TO NOMINAL YIELDS.

01:39:58 THROUGH 5% HIGHER. HIGHER YIELDS IN THE LAST

01:40:01 MONTH, THEN LOWER. THIS MORNING, 441.

01:40:11 CITI'S QUOTE.

01:40:20 GOING ON TO SAY THE REALITY IS LESS PLEASANT.

01:40:25 INITIAL CLAIMS, CONTINUING CLAIMS MAY BE AN EARLY SIGN

01:40:28 ACTIVITY IS SLOWING AND GOES ON TO SAY, AND THIS IS THE

01:40:31 IMPORTANT LINE, INFLATION STUCK ABOUT 3% WILL CONSTRAIN THE FED

01:40:35 FROM ACTING PREDICTABLY TO AVOID A GROWTH SLOWDOWN.

01:40:38 THAT THERE I THINK IS THE COUNTERPOINT TO THE HAPPY TALK

01:40:43 AROUND THE SOFT LANDING, DISINFLATIONARY STORY. JON:

01:40:49 WE WILL SEE THAT IN THE COMING DATA.

01:40:56 WHAT I FIND IMPORTANT HERE IS, FOR EXAMPLE, ON THIS WEEKEND OF

01:40:59 PERFECT HOME VIEWING, LEAVES FALLING, THE LEAVES OF NEW

01:41:02 ENGLAND, THINK OF WHAT CENTRAL PARK LOOKS LIKE. JON:

01:41:05 WE CAN TAKE A STROLL. TOM: EIGHT POINT OH 3% DOWN TO SEVEN

01:41:09 .69%. IF WE GET THE PRESUMED DISINFLATION, WHAT DO YOU DO

01:41:18 WITH THE MORTGAGE? YOU SAY LET'S GO.

01:41:29 JON: A LOT OF EQUITY BOWLS WANT TO

01:41:30 DECLARE VICTORY OVER INFLATION. THE FEDERAL RESERVE DOES NOT

01:41:33 WANT TO GO THERE. OFFICIALS DON'T WANT TO

01:41:36 PREMATURELY DECLARE VICTORY OVER INFLATION.

01:41:38 CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO MARKETS IF THEY DID?

01:41:41 GERMAN PAL WITH A SPEECH TOMORROW. TOM:

01:41:43 HE HAS TO BE EXPOSED. JON: HE SAYS WE ARE DONE.

01:41:47 WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS MONDAY? TOM:

01:41:50 WE SAW THAT THIS WEEK WITH THE REPORT.

01:41:57 TO DESCRIBE THAT RATIO, THE BLOOMBERG FINANCIAL CONDITIONS

01:41:58 INDEX, AND IT SCREAMS ACCOMMODATIVE AT 0.26%, EXACTLY

01:42:03 WHAT CHAIRMAN POWELL DOES NOT WANT. HE NEEDS A DATA CHECK.

01:42:06 JON: A DATA CHECK. TOM: WE SHOULD DO ONE NOW. JON:

01:42:10 EQUITY FUTURES ON THE S&P. I WILL KEEP IT VANILLA.

01:42:15 EQUITIES AT THE MOMENT POSITIVE BY .26%.

01:42:17 I HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS THREE DAY WINNING STREAK.

01:42:19 COULD BE THREE WEEKS OF GAINS ON THE S&P.

01:42:21 UP A LITTLE MORE THAN 2% OVER THE LAST THREE DAYS.

01:42:27 THREE WEEKS OF GAINS, LONGEST WEEKLY STREET POTENTIALLY GOING

01:42:28 BACK TO JULY. LOOK AT THE BOND MARKET.

01:42:33 DOWN TO BASIS POINTS ON THE TENURE.

01:42:35 WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT CRUDE. ENTERING BEAR MARKET TERRITORY.

01:42:40 DOWN 20% FROM WHERE WE WERE IN SEPTEMBER.

01:42:44 I WAS LOOKING AT CRUDE EARLIER THIS MORNING LIKE YOU WERE.

01:42:47 A PERCENT, 9% ON THE MONTH THIS MONTH. CLOSE TO 11% LAST MONTH.

01:42:52 WE HAD A CONVERSATION AT THE START OF OCTOBER.

01:42:54 WE WENT TO LONDON TOGETHER. TRIPLE DIGIT CRUDE BY HALLOWEEN.

01:43:00 HERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE 70'S, MAYBE EVEN A BREAK OF

01:43:07 THEM. TOM:

01:43:09 GASOLINE IS AN EMOTIONAL TOPIC. OBSCURE ON A FRIDAY.

01:43:13 WE LIKE OBSCURE ON A FRIDAY AND WE DO THIS BECAUSE ITALY IS

01:43:17 TAKING ON NORTHERN MACEDONIA. LOOKING AT THE ITALY-GERMAN

01:43:22 SPREAD SHOWING SOME QUIESCENCE, WHERE IF YOU BREAK DOWN TO NEW

01:43:26 CONSTRUCTION FOR ITALY, AGAIN, THAT SAME IDEA OF A GOOD

01:43:29 FEELING. JON: THEY NEED THAT NOW BECAUSE

01:43:32 THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT

01:43:38 MALONEY'S PLANS FOR THE -- MELL ONI'S PLANS FOR THE DEFICIT AND

01:43:41 THERE MAY BE A DISPUTE ON THE HORIZON.

01:43:43 WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO PLAY THAT GAME AGAIN ON THE

01:43:46 PERIPHERY, PARTICULARLY IN ITALY. TOM: THE HEAD OF U.S.

01:43:50 EQUITIES AT UBS GLOBAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT JOINS US.

01:43:59 I HAVE A 72 PAGE UBS PHONEBOOK WITH SCENARIOS LINKING GDP AND

01:44:03 YIELD INTO STANDARD & POOR'S 500.

01:44:07 WHICH SCENARIO DO YOU BELIEVE IN WHICH MARK -- BELIEVE IN?

01:44:12 >> THAT'S AN EASY QUESTION. OUR BASE CASE, TOM, IS THAT WE

01:44:19 WILL SEE MODERATE GAMES IN THE EQUITY MARKET -- MODERATE GAINS

01:44:21 IN THE EQUITY MARKET IN THE COMING 12 MONTH.

01:44:25 WE ARE ALSO GOING TO SEE SOME NICE GAINS IN THE BOND MARKET

01:44:29 WITH YIELDS FALLING, SO OUR MAIN MESSAGE IS WE THINK

01:44:34 THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT WE CAN HAVE A SOFT LANDING.

01:44:38 THAT'S REALLY THE CORE OF OUR BASE CASE.

01:44:41 ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE U.S. WILL LIKELY SLOW DOWN.

01:44:43 THE STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENTS HAVE RESTARTED.

01:44:46 EXCESS SAVINGS ARE BECOMING LESS PRONOUNCED.

01:44:49 BUT WE THINK THE SOFT LANDING MAKES SENSE. TOM:

01:44:52 THIS IS SO IMPORTANT. I AM TRYING TO BUY MY FIRST

01:44:56 SHARE THIS WEEKEND. IF I LOOK AT FACTOR ANALYSIS,

01:45:01 WHICH OF THOSE FACTORS WILL BENEFIT NEXT YEAR?

01:45:05 INTERNATIONAL VERSUS U.S., VALUE VERSUS GROWTH, AND THE

01:45:09 OTHER 14 FACTORS. WHICH MATTERS TO YOU?

01:45:15 >> ARE FACTOR THAT WE LIKE THE MOST ACROSS STOCKS AND BONDS IS

01:45:16 QUALITY. WE ARE IN A LATE CYCLE ENVIRONMENT.

01:45:21 WE HAVE A LOW UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, AN INVERTED YIELD CURVE,

01:45:25 AND INFLATION IS COMING DOWN BUT IT'S STILL HIGHER THAN THE

01:45:26 FED'S TARGET. THAT'S A LATE CYCLE ENVIRONMENT.

01:45:31 FOR STOCKS, THAT SUGGESTS YOU WANT TO OWN QUALITY COMPANIES.

01:45:34 THESE ARE COMPANIES THAT HAVE HIGH RETURNS ON CAPITAL, STRONG

01:45:38 BALANCE SHEETS, GENERATE CONSISTENT AND LESS VOLATILE

01:45:40 EARNINGS GROWTH. I THINK THE SAME IS TRUE IN THE

01:45:43 BOND MARKET. YOU CAN GO INTO INVESTMENT

01:45:48 GRADE CORPORATES, GET A PRETTY NICE ABSOLUTE RETURN.

01:45:51 THERE'S OTHER PARTS OF THE BOND MARKET THAT ALSO LOOK PRETTY

01:45:52 INTERESTING. IN THE U.S., WE LIKE HIGH

01:45:55 YIELDS.

01:46:01 SO I THINK THERE'S A HOST OF OPPORTUNITIES BUT WE WOULD

01:46:02 CLEARLY FOCUS ON QUALITY ACROSS THE SPECTRUM. JON:

01:46:05 CAN WE GET YOUR RATE CUT CALL? WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR NEXT

01:46:07 YEAR?

01:46:10 >> WE THINK THE FED IS GOING TO BE SLOWER IN TERMS OF CUTTING

01:46:15 RATES THAN WHAT THE MARKET IS PRICING.

01:46:20 WE ARE PENCILING IN TWO, MAYBE THREE, BUT I THINK THIS FED,

01:46:21 ESPECIALLY WITH THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AS LOW AS IT

01:46:25 IS, I THINK THIS FED IS GOING TO BE FAIRLY CAUTIOUS IN TERMS

01:46:28 OF GETTING TO AGGRESSIVE, AND TO WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT

01:46:30 EARLIER, THE LAST THING POWELL

01:46:37 WANTS TO SEE IS A HUGE INCREASE IN -- A SUBSTANTIAL LOOSENING

01:46:41 AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS JUST AS THEY ARE BEGINNING TO GET

01:46:43 THEIR ARMS AROUND INFLATION AND HAVE MORE TO GO TO GET IT BACK

01:46:44 TO TARGET. JON: THIS IS WHAT TOM HAS BEEN

01:46:47 LEADING INTO. THAT KEEPS REAL RATES QUITE

01:46:50 ELEVATED. HOW MUCH OF A CHALLENGE TO

01:46:55 VALUATIONS WILL THAT BE AS PEOPLE GET BOLD UP -- GET

01:47:01 BULLED UP ON THE IDEA THAT IT'S ALLEDGE FOR EQUITIES -- THAT IT

01:47:05 IS BULLISH FOR EQUITIES?

01:47:06 >> WE ARE NOT EXPECTING BIG GAINS IN THE S&P FOR THE COMING

01:47:09 12 MONTHS. OUR EXPECTATION IS WE WILL SEE

01:47:12 ROUGHLY 5% GAINS. WE HAD A VERY STRONG RALLY JUST

01:47:16 IN THE LAST TWO OR THREE WEEK. SO I THINK RATES ON THE REAL

01:47:20 SIDE WILL REMAIN FAIRLY HIGH. I THINK WHAT'S GOING TO BE THE

01:47:25 MORE IMPORTANT DRIVER YEAR IS GOING TO BE THE FACT THAT

01:47:27 EARNINGS GROWTH SHOULD IMPROVE A LITTLE BIT.

01:47:32 THAT SHOULD SUPPORT THE MARKET, BUT AGAIN, A LOT OF THE SOFT

01:47:35 MARKET AT THIS POINT -- SOFT LANDING AT THIS POINT IS PRICED

01:47:36 IN. TOM: WHAT DO YOU DO IN CASH IN THE

01:47:39 NEXT 12 MONTHS?

01:47:42 >> I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES OUT THERE IN

01:47:43 FIXED INCOME. YOU CAN GO OUT THE RISK

01:47:46 SPECTRUM WITHOUT TAKING TOO MUCH RISK.

01:47:50 YOU CAN GET AN ICE PICK UP YIELD, INVESTMENT GRADE -- GET

01:47:55 A NICE PICKUP IN YIELD, INVESTMENT GRADE.

01:47:57 YOU GET A NICE TOTAL RETURN. WE HAVE THE 10 YEAR GOING TO

01:48:02 3.5% BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR. CASH IS GOING TO HAVE A HARD

01:48:05 TIME COMPETING WITH THAT. TOM: ABRAMOWITZ IS NOT HERE BUT I

01:48:13 HAVE TO ASK WESTERN SHE WOULD -- ASK A QUESTION SHE WOULD.

01:48:20 IN MY RIGHT?

01:48:21 >> YEAH. WE ALSO LIKE MORTGAGES AS WELL.

01:48:28 MBS. WE HAVE BEEN TIPTOEING OUT ON

01:48:30 THE DURATION CURVE. I THINK THAT WOULD MAKE A LOT

01:48:33 OF SENSE. TOM: DID I DO OK? JON: BEAUTIFUL.

01:48:37 DID YOU SEE THE HEADLINE ACROSS TO THE BLOOMBERG ON THE DOLLAR

01:48:43 INDEX? RAISING THE GAINS FOR 2023.

01:48:46 THE DOLLAR INDEX WIPING OUT GAINS FOR 2023. TOM: YEAH.

01:48:51 CURRENCY IS THE ULTIMATE LITMUS PAPER AND I WOULD SUGGEST

01:48:55 WITHIN THE BROADER SPECTRUM YOU CANNOT HAVE AN INTERNATIONAL

01:48:56 POP WITHOUT A WEAK DOLLAR. I SUBSCRIBE TO THAT. JON:

01:49:00 CAN WE FINISH THAT? ONE THING A LOT OF PEOPLE GOT

01:49:03 WRONG, THIS MARKET HAS BEEN SO PUNISHING AND THIS ECONOMY HAS

01:49:06 SURPRISED IN DIFFERENT WAYS. THE U.S.

01:49:09 ECONOMY HAS BEEN SO MUCH BETTER THAN PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE

01:49:11 AND CHINA SPECIFICALLY HAS BEEN MUCH WORSE.

01:49:16 GIVEN HOW WE HAVE RESET THOSE BARS GOING INTO 2024, WHAT'S

01:49:18 THE INTERNATIONAL CALL FOR NEXT YEAR FOR YOU AND THE TEAM?

01:49:22 >> CLEARLY, CHINA HAS BEEN DISAPPOINTING IN TERMS OF

01:49:26 ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE. THE U.S. HAS BEEN BETTER, AS YOU SAID,

01:49:30 BUT I ALSO THINK AT THIS POINT THAT'S LARGELY REFLECTED IN

01:49:34 THEIR SHARES. YOU HAVE PRETTY FULL VALUATIONS

01:49:37 IN THE U.S., VERY DEPRESSED SENTIMENT IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES,

01:49:41 THE EMERGING-MARKET COMPLEX, SO WE ACTUALLY THINK THAT'S AN

01:49:45 OPPORTUNITY. WE THINK CHINESE GROWTH IS

01:49:48 GOING TO STABILIZE AND GIVEN HOW POOR THE SENTIMENT IS IN

01:49:51 SOME OF THESE EMERGING MARKETS, ESPECIALLY CHINA, THAT'S AN

01:49:54 OPPORTUNITY TO US. VERY DIFFERENT SCENARIO WITH

01:49:57 THE U.S. WE THINK IT CAN DO OK BUT WE

01:50:01 HAVE TO RECOGNIZE AND BE COGNIZANT OF THE HIGH

01:50:04 VALUATIONS. JON: ARE YOU CONVINCED BY THE CHARM

01:50:08 OFFENSIVE THAT CAME FROM XI IN SAN FRANCISCO THIS WEEK?

01:50:09 DOES THAT EVEN MATTER? IS THAT RELEVANT TO YOUR CALL?

01:50:13 >> NO. THAT'S NOT A BIG PART OF THE

01:50:14 CALL. IT'S MORE ABOUT THE MYSTIC POLICY PRESSURES -- MEASURES

01:50:22 THEY ARE PUTTING -- ABOUT THE DOMESTIC POLICY MEASURES THEY

01:50:23 ARE PUTTING IN PLACE AND WHAT THEY ARE DOING ON THE INTEREST

01:50:25 RATE SIDE AS WELL. IT'S MORE ABOUT DOMESTIC

01:50:27 POLITICS. I THINK A LOT OF WESTERN

01:50:34 COMPANIES ARE REALLY JUST FUNDAMENTALLY RETHINKING THEIR

01:50:35 SUPPLY CHAINS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. I'M NOT SURE WHEN MEETING

01:50:40 BETWEEN TWO PRESIDENTS IS GOING TO CHANGE HOW THEY THINK ABOUT

01:50:42 DIVERSIFYING AND HAVING SOME RESILIENCY IN THEIR SUPPLY

01:50:44 CHAINS. THAT IS I THINK A DIFFERENT

01:50:46 STORY. JON: WE HAVE HEARD THAT ALREADY.

01:50:50 GOOD TO GET YOUR PERSPECTIVE. DAVID OF UBS GLOBAL WEALTH

01:50:53 MANAGEMENT. IF YOU ARE JUST JOINING US,

01:50:55 WELCOME. EQUITIES ARE POSITIVE, UP

01:50:58 NICELY. POSITIVE 0.33%.

01:51:05 WE TALK ABOUT THIS CHARM OFFENSIVE FROM XI JINPING,

01:51:11 PLEDGING HEARTWARMING STEPS TO ATTRACT FOREIGN CAPITAL,

01:51:12 LOOKING TO CREATE A WORLD-CLASS BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT. TOM:

01:51:17 THE PHRASES WERE, YOU KNOW, MANAGED TO SAY THE LEAST. I GET

01:51:22 THE DICTATOR THING AND ALL THAT, BUT TO ME -- JON: THEY

01:51:25 SHOOK THAT OFF. TOM: WHAT IS THE SIGNAL HE SENDS

01:51:32 WITH THE DEFENSE SECRETARY IN THE PHILIPPINES LOOKING AT A

01:51:33 BASE BUILD OUT? FORGET ABOUT TRADE AGREEMENTS

01:51:35 AND ALL THAT.

01:51:41 WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT HERE IS WHAT IS THE SIGNAL THE CHINESE

01:51:46 SEND THAT THEY GET THE MESSAGE THAT THE PENDULUM WENT TOO FAR?

01:51:49 I CIRCLE BACK TO HONG KONG. MAYBE I'M WRONG.

01:51:54 I HAVE NOT A LOT -- I HAVE NOT HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE AGREE WITH

01:51:55 ME. JON: YOU CAN SIGNAL WITH WORDS BUT

01:52:00 ULTIMATELY YOU NEED POLICY TO GET PEOPLE TO BUY IT.

01:52:03 SOME PEOPLE MIGHT ARGUE THAT THE TRAIN HAS LEFT THE STATION.

01:52:07 THESE COMPANIES ARE ALREADY THINKING ABOUT MOVING AND THEY

01:52:08 ARE DOING THAT. THEY ARE REENGINEERING SUPPLY

01:52:11 CHAINS, BRINGING THEM CLOSER TO HOME.

01:52:13 WE HAVE SEEN MUCH OF THAT FROM DIFFERENT COMPANIES.

01:52:14 BUT I'M WITH YOU. YOU HAVE TO PROVE IT TO ATTRACT

01:52:17 FOREIGN INVESTMENT AGAIN. WORDS WILL NOT DO IT. TOM:

01:52:20 IT IS ACTION. ONE OF THE ESSAYS OF THE YEAR

01:52:24 WAS IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS. DOES XI HAVE CONTROL OVER THE

01:52:29 CITIES AND THE LORDS OF THE CHINESE CITIES?

01:52:32 THAT IS A DO
