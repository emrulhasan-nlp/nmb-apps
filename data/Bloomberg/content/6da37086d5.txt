00:11 >> WE HAVE DEFINITELY BEEN IN SOMEWHAT OF A ROLLING

00:14 RECESSION, BUT WE CAN ALL AGREE WE HAVE NOT BEEN IN A LABOR

00:17 MARKET RECESSION.

00:21 >> THESE KINDS OF NUMBERS, YOU QUESTION WHETHER THEY SLOW DOWN

00:22 MATERIALLY AT ALL.

00:28 >> WE SEE SIGNS THAT MAKE US WORRIED ABOUT THE

00:29 SUSTAINABILITY OF THE JOB EXPANSION.

00:33 >> THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT SUSTAINABLY IS TO HAVE A BIG

00:34 BOOM IN PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH.

00:38 >> YOU DO NOT NEED TO HAVE AN ECONOMIC COLLAPSE TO GET THE

00:40 INFLATION RATE LOWER.

00:41 >> THIS IS "BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE"

00:42 WITH TOM KEENE, JONATHAN FERRO, AND LISA ABRAMOWICZ. JONATHAN:

00:47 LET'S GET YOUR TRADING WEEK STARTED.

00:50 LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY THIS MORNING, GOOD MORNING.

00:51 FOR OUR AUDIENCE WORLDWIDE, THIS IS "BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE"

00:56 ON TV AND RADIO. YOUR EQUITY MARKET ON THE S&P

01:01 SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE AFTER NINE WEEKS OF GAINS ON THE S&P 500.

01:06 WE DELIVER A WEEK OF LOSSES TO KICK OFF 2024.

01:09 CPI LATER THIS WEEK, THEN BANK EARNINGS FRIDAY. TOM:

01:12 WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT? THE "FTE"

01:18 HAS A MAJOR HEADLINE ON HUGE CHALLENGES.

01:21 I WILL PUT EXTRA WEIGHT ON BANK EARNINGS.

01:24 BUT ON INFLATION, I THINK THERE IS A MASSIVE MYSTERY.

01:28 WHAT A JOY TO HAVE LORI CALVASINA COMING UP WITH SOME

01:30 REAL OPTIMISM. JONATHAN:

01:37 I'VE READ NOTE AFTER NOTE AFTER NOTE ASKING ONE QUESTION.

01:38 WHAT CAN GO WRONG? NOTHING CAN GO WRONG OPTIMISM

01:43 IS AT RISK. LISA: AND THE RISK IN THE FIRST WEEK

01:50 WAS THIS IDEA THAT THIS OVER OPTIMISM IN FED RATE CUTS THAT

01:53 PEOPLE WERE FORESEEING -- FRIDAY WAS REALLY INTERESTING.

01:57 THE DATA WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE. WE GOT A REPORT THAT SEEMED

02:02 GOOD ON ITS FACE, THEN WE GOT SERVICES DATA THAT LOOKED WEAK

02:07 ON ITS FACE, AND EVERYONE WENT FOR THE WEAKNESS.

02:12 OPTIMISM IN RATE CUTS SEEMS TO BE -- TOM:

02:16 HE THOUGHT ALL IN ALL IT WAS CONSTRUCTIVE DATA.

02:19 BUT I TAKE YOUR POINT. I THOUGHT DATA ROSENBERG WAS

02:27 BRILLIANT PARSING OUT WHAT AND ALONG WAS TALKING ABOUT, WHICH

02:28 IS THE BIRTH-DEATH ADJUSTMENT. YOU ADJUST TO A HUGE NUMBER.

02:36 LIKE 400,000 JOBS DISAPPEAR FROM 2023. JONATHAN:

02:39 SPEAKING OF WHAT CAN GO WRONG, WHAT CAN GO WRONG WHEN YOU

02:45 BOARD A 737 9 MAX JET? CAN YOU IMAGINE BEING ON THIS

02:49 FLIGHT OVER THE WEEKEND? LISA: I AM JUST GRATEFUL THAT NO ONE

02:58 WAS SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO THE PLUG, THE 63 POUND THING THAT

03:00 BLEW OUT. IS THIS A MANUFACTURING PROBLEM?

03:04 A PROBLEM -- PRODUCT PROBLEM?

03:11 HOW MANY 737 MAX 9'S WILL GET GROUNDED? TOM:

03:14 AND IT IS INCREMENTAL. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS

03:19 BEFORE WE WENT TO AIR, BUT YOU GO TO SEATTLE, CHICAGO,

03:24 SOMEWHERE OUTSIDE WASHINGTON, AND IT HAS JUST BEEN THIS

03:28 THING, THAT THING, THE PLACEMENT OF THE ENGINES

03:32 RELATIVE TO THE WING AND ON AND ON, YET AIRBUS -- AND I COULD

03:34 BE WRONG. WE WILL TALK TO EXPERTS ON THE

03:36 SHOW TODAY. AIRBUS JUST CONTINUES TO MOVE

03:38 FORWARD. THERE IS A REAL DISTINCTION.

03:43 JONATHAN: ONE OF THOSE EXPERTS COMING UP

03:46 LATER THIS HOUR. AS WE KICK OFF YOUR MORNING,

03:48 HERE ARE THE SCORES. STARTING WITH THE EQUITY

03:54 MARKET, NEGATIVE AGAIN BY ONE QUARTER OF 1%.

03:56 KICKING OFF OF THE WEEK A LITTLE BIT SOFTER.

04:02 ON THE SURFACE OF THINGS, PAYROLLS LOOK DECENT.

04:03 BENEATH THE SURFACE, SOME CRACKS.

04:12 THEN THE EMPLOYMENT INDEX -- LISA:

04:13 IT FELL THE MOST AND THE LOWEST WE HAVE SEEN GOING BACK TO THE

04:16 HEART OF THE PANDEMIC IN 2020. WILL WE GET CONFIRMATION OF THE

04:20 DISINFLATION NARRATIVE THURSDAY? THAT WILL BE THE KEY ECONOMIC

04:22 DATA POINT. CPI COMING IN THURSDAY.

04:26 WE HAVE SEEN THAT THE CLIENT. DO WE SEE THAT CONTINUE GIVEN

04:30 SOME OF THE PRESSURES PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THAT COULD REINFLATE

04:31 LATER ON? WE ALSO GET PPI FRIDAY.

04:36 WE GET A BUNCH OF TREASURY OPTIONS THIS WEEK.

04:40 I AM REALLY FOCUSED ON THIS AT A TIME WHEN THE U.S.

04:43 TOTAL PUBLIC DEBT TRADING IN THE SYSTEM HAS DOUBLED SINCE

04:45 2014. THREE-YEAR NOTES TOMORROW, 37

04:51 BILLION DOLLARS OF 10-YEAR NOTE'S WEDNESDAY, AND $21

04:54 BILLION OF 30 YEAR NOTES THURSDAY AND CORPORATE EARNINGS

04:55 FRIDAY. IT SHOULD BE AN INTERESTING,

04:59 DIVERSE READ ON WHERE WE ARE. JONATHAN:

05:03 LOSS OF DATA AND LOSS OF EARNINGS, COMING UP.

05:06 STARTING THE CONVERSATION WITH LORI CALVASINA, THE HEAD OF U.S.

05:09 EQUITY STRATEGY AT RBC. THIS JUMPED OUT IN YOUR MOST

05:12 RECENT NOTE. THE BEGINNING OF A PHASE OF

05:17 TURBULENCE. HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU ABOUT

05:19 THAT? LORI: I WAS TALKING TO ONE OF MY

05:24 TRADERS LAST WEEKEND WE WERE DISCUSSING THE CFTC DATA THAT

05:26 IS LOOKING VERY STRETCHED. I SAID, THIS LOOKS SCARY.

05:33 WE NEED TO KEEP IN MIND SENTIMENT HAS BEEN OSCILLATING

05:35 VERY QUICKLY OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS, SO THIS IS NOT

05:39 NECESSARILY SOMETHING THAT HAS TO DERAIL A CALL FOR THE YEAR,

05:42 MAYBE JUST DAMPEN ENTHUSIASM A BIT.

05:48 BUT WE ARE STARTING TO SEE DATA FROM INSTITUTIONAL LINE UP WITH

05:50 RETAIL, AND BOTH ARE LOOKING VERY STRETCHED RIGHT NOW.

05:54 THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT COULD COME IN AND TRIP

05:58 THIS MARKET UP A BIT, BUT USUALLY IT IS SOMETHING THE

06:00 MARKET DOES NOT SEE COMING, SO WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THE IDEA

06:03 SENTIMENT GOT CARRIED AWAY AT THE END OF LAST YEAR. TOM:

06:07 MIKE WILSON HAS BEEN CAUTIOUS ON THE MARKET COME OVER AT

06:12 MORGAN STANLEY, THAT NOMINAL GROWTH COULD BE THE SURPRISE,

06:16 ONE OF HIS MORE OPTIMISTIC CONSTRUCTIONS OF THE MYSTERY OF

06:18 WHERE WE ARE HEADING IN AT 2024. WHAT DO MID-CAPS AND SMALL CAPS

06:23 DO IF WE GET LEGITIMATE ANIMAL SPIRIT?

06:28 WE GET LEGITIMATE NOMINAL GDP? LORI:

06:32 WHAT WE HAVE TYPICALLY SEEN -- AND I WILL LOOK AT IT IN REAL

06:34 TERMS INSTEAD OF PHENOMENAL. BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT GDP

06:39 ABOVE 2.6%, AND 2.6 PERCENT HAS BEEN THE LONG-TERM AVERAGE

06:45 SINCE THE 1970'S, WE TYPICALLY SEE SMALL CAPS OUTPERFORM IN

06:46 THAT ENVIRONMENT. WHEN GDP IS RUNNING COOL, THAT

06:50 IS WHEN GDP TENDS TO OUTPERFORM. WE HAVE GOT GDP FORECASTS

06:56 SITTING AT ABOUT 1.3% THIS YEAR COME UP FROM ABOUT 1% IN

06:59 NOVEMBER, SO THEY ARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

07:05 BUT IF WE WANT A LASTING, SUSTAINABLE LEADERSHIP ROTATION

07:10 AWAY FROM MEGACAP STOCKS TO EVERYTHING ELSE, YOU NEED TO

07:12 SEE GDP EXPECTATIONS MOVE UP QUITE A BIT MORE FROM WHERE

07:13 THEY ARE RIGHT NOW. TOM: GDP HAS GOT TO COME UP, I GET

07:18 THAT, BUT WHAT DO WE DO NOW? ARE YOU DEPLOYING CASH TO SMALL

07:23 CAPS AND MID-CAPS? LORI: I STILL LIKE THEM.

07:28 I DO NOT LIKE THEM QUITE AS MUCH AS I DID FOUR OR FIVE

07:30 WEEKS AGO WHEN WE LAST SPOKE. ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE SEEN

07:35 IS, IN ADDITION TO SENTIMENT GETTING FROTHY IN THE BROADER

07:39 MARKET, IF YOU LOOK AT SMALL-CAP POSITIONING ON THE

07:42 CFTC DATA, WE ARE AT THREE-YEAR HIGHS BUT NOT ALL-TIME HIGHS,

07:47 SO WE WILL KNOW SOON WHETHER IT SMALL CAPS ARE ABLE TO POWER

07:49 THROUGH AND TAKE THINGS UP ANOTHER LEG.

07:54 WE ARE ALSO SEEING SMALL CAPS LOOK CHEAP RELATIVE TO LARGE,

07:57 BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE RUSSELL 2000 FORWARD PE, IT IS BACK TO

07:58 AVERAGE. THAT IS NOT USUALLY WHERE

08:02 THINGS TOP OUT AT, BUT IT IS TELLING US TO BE WE HAVE MADE A

08:04 LOT OF THE EASY MONEY IN SMALL CAPS ALREADY. DO I LIKE THEM?

08:07 YES. AS MUCH AS A MONTH AGO? NOT QUITE.

08:15 LISA: THIS ALL SOUNDS NEGATIVE, YET

08:18 YOU JUST UPDATED YOUR FORECAST TO A 51-50, A 10% UPSIDE.

08:22 IF IT IS NOT SMALL CAPS, WHAT LEADS? LORI:

08:26 VALUE STOCKS IN PARTICULAR OR SOMETHING TO KEEP AN EYE ON.

08:29 WE HAVE SEEN FINANCIALS DO QUITE WELL.

08:33 WE ARE STARTING TO SEE SOME OF OUR FAVORABLE VIEWS EMERGE ON

08:34 THE INDUSTRIALS AS WELL. WE WILL GET INTERESTING CLUES

08:38 IN THIS REPORTING SEASON, BUT SECTOR COMPOSITION IS TOUGH

08:42 RIGHT NOW. IF YOU GO BACK TO OUR TARGET,

08:47 WE WERE ANTICIPATING A 10% RETURN. . WE PUT THAT TARGET OUT

08:50 MID-NOVEMBER. WE WERE ON THE EARLIER SIDE OF

08:51 PUTTING TARGETS OUT. WE TRUED UP ALL OF OUR MODELS

08:58 FOR YEAR AND -- YEAR END. NOW WE ARE SITTING, EVEN WITH

09:03 THIS UPDATE, IT IS ONLY AN 8% RETURN ON THE YEAR.

09:07 IT IS NOT NECESSARILY GETTING MORE BULLISH, IT IS CHEWING OUR

09:08 MODEL UP. LISA: YOU MENTIONED BANKS.

09:14 HOW IMPORTANT IS FRIDAY GOING TO BE AS JPMORGAN KICKS OFF THE

09:17 EARNINGS, TO GIVE A SENSE OF WHAT THE LANDSCAPE IS FOR BANKS?

09:22 OR IS IT JUST JPMORGAN'S WORLD, AND EVERYBODY ELSE IS LIVING IN

09:23 IT? LORI: I THINK THEY ALL MATTER.

09:28 I DO NOT THINK IT IS ANY ONE PARTICULAR BANK.

09:31 SOME GET MORE ATTENTION. WHAT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE BANKS

09:35 IS ARE THESE THE SORT OF STRONG NUMBERS WE HAVE SEEN IN

09:37 PERFORMANCE HOLDING UP? SOMETIMES WE SEE THE BANKS GIVE

09:44 BACK WHEN THEY HAVE STRONG EARNINGS, SO ARE THE NUMBERS

09:47 GOING TO BE STRONG ENOUGH TO SUSTAIN THE BETTER TRENDS?

09:53 BUT ALSO, FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME WHO IS NOT A SPECIALIST IN THE

09:56 FINANCIALS, WE GO IN AND LOOK AT THE FINANCIALS FOR CLUES ON

09:59 THE PLUMBING OF THE ECONOMY, THE HEALTH OF THE CONSUMER.

10:03 THAT WILL PROBABLY BE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING COMING OUT OF

10:04 THE BANK EARNINGS. JONATHAN: THE REAL HEADLINE OUT OF THE

10:10 WEEKEND -- A POSITIVE SURPRISE IN WASHINGTON, D.C.

10:12 CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS ANNOUNCING A DEAL ON TOPLINE

10:15 SPENDING FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR.

10:21 WE TALKED ABOUT YOUR LINE, THAT TALKING ABOUT POLITICS, THE

10:23 ELECTION THIS YEAR SPECIFICALLY, IS LIKE STARING

10:24 AT THE SUN. IS IT THAT BAD THIS YEAR FOR

10:27 YOU AND THE TEAM? LORI: YEAH, IT IS PRETTY AWFUL.

10:34 THAT LINE COME FROM MY CONVERSATIONS WITH U.S.-BASED

10:36 INVESTORS, WHO ARE LIKE, OK, TIME TO WRITE OUR OUTLOOKS.

10:39 WHAT DO WE SAY ABOUT THIS? WE WALK PEOPLE THROUGH DATA,

10:45 GET THROUGH IT QUICKLY, THEN MOVE ON. EUROPEAN AND CANADIAN

10:48 INVESTORS, YOU COULD EASILY SPEND A WHOLE MEETING ON THIS.

10:50 IT IS LIKE A SPECTATOR SPORT THEM AT THIS POINT.

10:53 BUT IT IS A MAJOR POINT OF UNCERTAINTY.

10:59 WHAT WAS INTERESTING FOR ME IS THAT YOU ARE STARTING TO SEE

11:04 MONEY FLOWS IMPROVE OR TURN POSITIVE TO JAPAN, EMERGING

11:06 MARKETS, CHINA, AND EUROPE. U.S. FLOWS ARE STILL HOLDING UP, BUT

11:12 WE ARE STARTING TO SEE NON-US JOGGER FREEZE ATTRACT --

11:16 GEOGRAPHIES ATTRACT BETTER FLOWS. THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE

11:19 ELECTION. TOM:

11:26 OUR QUESTION, FOR RBC CLIENTS WATCHING, LISTENING, WE STARTED

11:32 THE YEAR WITH A TERRIBLE WEEK -- IS THERE ANY VALIDITY TO

11:33 THAT EMOTION? LORI:

11:39 I TEND TO BE SKEPTICAL OF THE SEASONAL STUDIES -- WHENEVER WE

11:41 DO THIS FOR THIS DAY, WE DO IT THE REST OF THE WEEK -- THOSE

11:46 STUDIES ARE BEING MASSAGED, FRANKLY, TO SHOW WHATEVER YOU

11:48 WANT TO SHOW. I HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT

11:50 SEASONALITY OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS.

11:53 WE HAVE HAD SOME GOOD ONES, WE HAVE HAD STINKERS, BUT WE HAVE

11:57 SEEN JANUARY HAS BEEN PRETTY MUCH A MIXED BAG.

12:01 THERE HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT ONES, ESPECIALLY OVER THE LAST FIVE

12:04 YEARS, SO IT WOULD BE KEEPING WITH THE RECENT SEASONALITY TO

12:05 HAVE A ROUGH START TO THE YEAR. DOES IT TELL YOU YOU YOU HAVE

12:09 TO RUN AWAY FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR? I DO NOT THINK SO.

12:15 SENTIMENT HAS BEEN OSCILLATING SO QUICKLY.

12:21 WE WERE OVERBOUGHT IN AUGUST, OVERSOLD IN NOVEMBER, AND --

12:26 SENTIMENT HELPS YOU TACTICALLY. I DO NOT THINK YOU CAN USE OF

12:30 THAT MUCH TO MAKE A LONGER TERM VIEW AT THIS POINT. JONATHAN:

12:34 WONDERFUL TO GET YOUR VIEWS THIS MORNING.

12:37 LORI CALVASINA OF RBC CAPITAL MARKETS.

12:42 IN THE NEAR TERM, SEEING REASON FOR MORE TURBULENCE FOR JANUARY

12:47 AND POTENTIALLY BEYOND. WE SAW THIS FROM J.P.

12:51 MORGAN -- STRETCH POSITIONING, COMPLACENT SENTIMENT.

12:54 NOT THE ONLY ONES WHO THINK THAT. LISA:

12:57 IT SEEMS TO BE BUILDING ON THIS IDEA THAT THINGS GOT OVERBOUGHT

13:00 IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER AND THIS IS THE HANGOVER FROM THAT.

13:04 THE KEY QUESTION IS ULTIMATELY IT WILL COME DOWN TO THE

13:06 ECONOMY, WHICH IS THE REASON EARNINGS WILL BE IMPORTANT.

13:10 CPI WILL BE IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE DATA WE GOT FRIDAY WAS

13:11 CONFUSING. JONATHAN: AND THE POLITICS -- IS THAT

13:14 GOOD NEWS FOR PEOPLE? LISA: I AM SKEPTICAL.

13:20 HEADLINE NUMBER, THAT IS WHERE THE EASY STUFF HAPPENS.

13:26 YOU LOOK UNDER THE HOOD, A MORE FRENCH REPUBLICANS ARE

13:28 CRITICIZING THIS AND SAYING IT IS ABSOLUTELY A NONSTARTER.

13:31 DEMOCRATS ARE COMING OUT AND SAYING WE ARE NOT CONCERNED.

13:34 THIS IS WHERE THE DETAILS COME TO PLAY. TOM:

13:37 MY TAKE OVER THE WEEKEND, AND I AM LOOKING AT THE SPX CHART

13:42 HERE ON THE BLOOMBERG -- I DO LOOK AT THE STANDARD AND

13:48 POOR'S, ONCE A YEAR -- COMING FROM 2022, IT IS UP COME UP,

13:52 AND AWAY, AND WE HAD A HORRIFIC CORRECTION OF 1.6%.

13:56 THE HYSTERICS I FIND FASCINATING.

13:57 I DO NOT HAVE AN OPINION. BULL, BEAR, THAT IS NOT OUR JOB.

14:04 BUT THE HYSTERICS ON A 1.6% PULLBACK? I AM BAFFLED.

14:06 JONATHAN: WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE HYSTERICS AND WASHINGTON.

14:16 REMEMBER WHEN CHINA SEEMINGLY LOST ITS DEFENSE MINISTER?

14:20 WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE DEFENSE SECRETARY IN THE UNITED

14:21 STATES OF AMERICA? LISA: DON'T YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT

14:24 IS? JONATHAN: WE DO NOT KNOW. WE WILL TRY TO FIND OUT.

15:16 >> WE HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATING IN GOOD FAITH ALL THROUGH THE

15:21 HOLIDAYS ON THE TOP LINE NUMBERS.

15:23 CONGRESS HAS A RESPONSIBILITY. WE HAVE THE POWER OF THE PURSE,

15:27 AND WE HAVE TO BE GOOD STEWARDS OF PRECIOUS TAXPAYER RESOURCES.

15:31 WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO BORROW MONDAY TO -- BORROW MONEY TO

15:33 SPEND IT. JONATHAN: HOUSE SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON ON

15:39 CBS YESTERDAY HOURS BEFORE AN ANNOUNCEMENT A DEAL WAS REACHED

15:42 ON TOPLINE SPENDING IN CONGRESS, EASING CONCERNS OF A

15:45 LOOMING U.S. GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN CARE THAT

15:47 IS POSITIVE NEWS THIS MORNING. HERE IS THE BROADER PRICE

15:50 ACTION FOR YOU. PULLING BACK ON THE S&P 500,

15:54 NEGATIVE BY .1%. YIELDS LOWER A SINGLE BASIS

15:58 POINT. THE MARCH TOWARDS CBI THURSDAY

16:02 AND EARNINGS FROM J.P. MORGAN AND BANK OF AMERICA

16:10 FRIDAY. TOM:

16:12 WHAT IS THE REAL YIELD AT 1.8% -- IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO

16:14 SEE OFF CPI WHERE THAT IS INTO THOSE BANK EARNINGS.

16:17 RIGHT TO IT. THE DIRECTOR OF POLICY RESEARCH

16:24 AT BTIG JOINS US NOW. WE HAD TO GO WITH THE HEADLINE,

16:29 ALL CLEAR IN CONGRESS, WE PASSED A BUDGET. IS THAT TRUE?

16:32 >> ABSOLUTELY NOT. WE NOW HAVE TOPLINE AGREEMENT

16:38 FROM WHAT WE CAN SPEND FOR THE FISCAL YEAR.

16:40 THAT IS GREAT, IT IS WONDERFUL. IT JUST MEANS THE HARD WORK

16:44 BEGINS NOW. THERE ARE TWO POINTS TO

16:46 HIGHLIGHT. YOU HAVE TO NOTICE HOW ANGRY

16:51 THE FAR RIGHT FLANK OF THE HOUSE GOP IS THIS MORNING.

16:55 WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE SPEAKER, SPEAKER JOHNSON, IS

16:58 OPERATING WITH NO ROOM FOR ERROR.

17:01 IF YOU WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY NEED DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT TO PASS

17:06 HIS BILL -- HE WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY NEED DEMOCRATIC

17:07 SUPPORT TO PASS HIS BILL. THAT IS SOMETHING SPEAKER

17:11 MCCARTHY DID NOT WANT TO DO, HAD TO DO, THEN GOT THROWN OUT

17:14 FROM THE SPEAKERSHIP. NUMBER TWO IS THERE ARE SO MANY

17:19 POINT OF DEPARTURE BETWEEN DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS WHEN

17:22 IT COMES TO THE SPECIFICS. THERE ARE UP TO 40 DIFFERENT

17:27 POISON PILLS, SOME GROUPS HAVE COUNTERED, THAT COULD SHUT DOWN

17:28 THE TALKS AROUND IT. THE RISK OF A SHUTDOWN IS

17:33 SLIGHTLY LOWER THIS MORNING, BUT THERE IS STILL A LOT OF

17:35 WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. TOM: WHAT IS THE PRIMARY TO DO LIST

17:40 OVER THE NEXT 11 DAYS? ISAAC:

17:47 SO WHAT I AM LOOKING AT IS MOVEMENT ON THE OTHER ISSUES

17:48 AROUND THE SPENDING THE. IT IS GOOD WE GOT THIS, AND NOW

17:55 I THINK THE APPROPRIATORS WILL SLINK BACK TO THEIR OFFICES AND

17:57 YOU WILL SEE SOME BACKROOM NEGOTIATION AND MAYBE NOT MUCH

17:59 THAN THAT. I AM INTERESTED IN THE BORDER

18:02 DEAL. THE SPENDING AGREEMENT IS PART

18:07 OF THIS 3D CHESS GAME WE HAVE GOT GOING ON.

18:10 THE OTHER PART IS THE SUPPLEMENTAL SPENDING MEASURES.

18:15 HERE I AM TALKING ABOUT BORDER SECURITY AND THEN, OF COURSE,

18:18 FUNDING FOR TAIWAN, UKRAINE, AND ISRAEL.

18:21 THAT IS THE OTHER PART OF IT. THE LINK TO ALL OF THAT IS THE

18:25 BORDER SECURITY DEAL. JONATHAN: YOU MENTIONED THE INTERNATIONAL

18:30 SECURITY CONCERNS. WE HAVE TO TALK OF THE CURIOUS

18:36 CASE OF THE MISSING DEFENSE SECRETARY.

18:38 FIRST OF ALL, WE WISH HIM A SPEEDY RECOVERY. FROM WHAT?

18:40 NONE OF US SEEMED TO KNOW.

18:46 LLOYD AUSTIN UNDERWENT AN ELECTIVE PROCEDURE IN LATE

18:48 DECEMBER, DID NOT TELL HIS STAFF THEY SHOULD NOTIFY OTHERS

18:53 WHEN HE WAS ADMITTED TO WALTER REED WHEN EXPERIENCING EXTREME

18:56 PAIN. AT THE SAME TIME, HIS CHIEF OF

18:59 STAFF FELL ILL AND DID NOT NOTIFY ANYONE.

19:01 THE PERSON WE HAVE BEEN SPEAKING TO SAID KATHLEEN HICKS

19:09 WAS QUICKLY PUT IN CHARGE OF RUNNING THE PENTAGON, ALTHOUGH

19:13 SHE WAS NOT INFORMED OF THE REASON, AND THE PRESIDENT,

19:15 SEEMINGLY FOR DAYS, DID NOT HAVE A CLUE. WHAT IS GOING ON?

19:19 ISAAC: THIS IS ONE OF THE WEIRDER

19:23 STORIES YOU WILL COME ACROSS IN THE FIGHTING ADMINISTRATION,

19:26 WHICH, BY AND LARGE, HAS BEEN PRETTY TAME FOR THESE PERSONNEL

19:30 STORIES, BUT IT IS DEEPLY UNSETTLING.

19:36 I KNOW THE SECRETARY IS AN INCREDIBLY PRIVATE PERSON AND

19:40 THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ALL HIS STAFF HAVE HIGHLIGHTED ABOUT

19:41 HIM, BUT YOU DO NOT GET TO BE THIS PRIVATE WHEN YOU ARE SIXTH

19:45 IN LINE IN THE PRESIDENTIAL LINE OF SUCCESSION.

19:50 THIS IS DEEPLY UNSETTLING, ESPECIALLY GIVEN TRANSPARENCY

19:52 IS ONE OF THE PILLARS OF OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM.

19:56 BUT ULTIMATELY, THIS, TOO, SHALL PASS, AND IT WILL REMIND

20:02 YOU OF THE STORIES OF PERSONNEL VOLATILITY WE SAW DURING THE

20:03 TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. THIS WILL BE ONE OF THE

20:06 CAMPAIGN TRAIL CONSIDERATIONS AS WELL. LISA:

20:09 YOU SAID VOLATILITY. DO YOU EXPECT HIM TO STEP DOWN?

20:14 ISAAC: KNOWN. DEPENDING ON HEALTH, HE WILL BE

20:15 FINE.

20:16 THE PRESIDENT HAS NOT MADE ANY COMMENTS TO SUGGEST THE DEFENSE

20:21 SECRETARY WILL LEAVE. I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED HE IS

20:25 REPLACED IF PRESIDENT BIDEN DOES WHEN REELECTION, THOUGH.

20:30 THIS IS THE TYPE OF THING THAT DOES NOT GET YOU REAPPOINTED.

20:33 LISA: THIS RAISES A QUESTION IN GENERAL ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY

20:36 AND THE PLATFORM FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN GOING FORWARD.

20:39 THERE ARE A RISK -- THERE ARE A LIST OF TASKS.

20:43 IS HE BASICALLY GOING TO BE RUNNING ON THE ANTI-TRUMP

20:46 TENDED TO SEE ONCE AGAIN AT A TIME WHEN TRUMP IS

20:50 CONSOLIDATING A LOT OF POPULAR SUPPORT? ISAAC:

20:53 THERE IS OBVIOUSLY -- YOU HAVE HEARD THAT LINE 1000 TIMES.

20:57 YOU CAMPAIGN IN POETRY BUT GOVERN IN PROSE.

21:01 I DO NOT THINK ANYONE WILL LIKE THE POETRY WE SEE FROM THE

21:03 CAMPAIGN TRAIL. IT WILL TRULY BE A FEAR DRIVEN

21:09 CAMPAIGN, FEAR OF THE OTHER SIDE, FEAR OF REVERSAL, FEAR OF

21:11 RETRIBUTION. I DO NOT THINK WE WILL SEE MUCH

21:15 HOPE AND EXCITEMENT COMING FROM THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. TOM:

21:20 YOU KNOW THE POLARITY OF THE STATES WITH OHIO AND OHIO

21:21 WESLEYAN. ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING OF THE

21:25 POLARITY OF THE IOWA CAUCUSES. WHAT IS THE SENSE OF TENSION AS

21:29 WE BEGIN THE POLITICAL SEASON IN IOWA? ISAAC:

21:34 PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARIES ARE ABOUT RETAIL POLITICS, AND THEY

21:41 ARE ABOUT PERSONAL PREFERENCE MORE SO THAN ANY NATIONAL POLL

21:42 COULD UNDERSTAND. YOU THINK ABOUT IOWA, YOU GOT

21:47 TO THINK ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAVING A 32 POINT LEAD.

21:51 YOU GOT THE THING ABOUT, ALSO -- AND THIS IS IMPORTANT --

21:54 DESANTIS WENT ALL IN ON IOWA. THIS IS IT FOR HIM.

21:59 IF YOU COMES IN SECOND AND LOSES BY 30 POINTS, WHICH THE

22:02 POLLS ARE SUGGESTING, PRETTY HARD TO IMAGINE HIM BEING

22:07 CONSIDERED A SERIOUS CONTENDER GOING INTO NEW HAMPSHIRE, WHERE

22:12 HE IS CLEARLY THIRD, FAR BEHIND HALEY.

22:16 SO IF HE LOSES AS BADLY AS IT LOOKS, I THINK HIS CAMPAIGN,

22:20 WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN FLOUNDERING, WILL EFFECTIVELY

22:22 BE OVER, AND IT IS A QUESTION OF HOW STRONG NIKKI HALEY CAN

22:24 LOOK IN NEW HAMPSHIRE LATER. JONATHAN:

22:28 IF HE LOSES AND HALF TO DROP OUT, WHO DOES HE BACK?

22:30 WHERE DO THOSE VOTES GO? ISAAC: I THINK IT WILL BE INCREDIBLY

22:34 DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO BACK ANYONE.

22:36 I THINK HE WILL REMAIN IN THE BACKGROUND.

22:40 MY BET, THOUGH, IS THOSE VOTES SPLIT SOMEWHAT TO HALEY, AND

22:44 THE REST STAY HOME FOR THE PRIMARY.

22:47 MY POINT TO CLIENTS IS TRUMP IS GOING TO BE THE NOMINEE.

22:51 HE IS THE LIKELY NOMINEE. THOSE VOTES WE ARE TRYING TO

22:55 FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY ARE GOING, THEY ARE GOING TO HIM IN

22:57 THE GENERAL ELECTION. THAT IS THE IMPORTANT POINT

22:59 HERE. THERE ARE STILL SO MANY CLIENTS

23:04 AND SO MANY IN D.C. WHO DO NOT WANT TRUMP V.

23:09 BIDEN, BUT ALL INDICATIONS ARE IT WILL BE TRUMP V. BIDEN.

23:13 JONATHAN: THANK YOU. ISAAC BOLTANKSY THERE.

23:20 THE POLITICS AND THE POLICY. WE GOT TO PICK UP ON THAT POINT.

23:25 SO MUCH TALK OF POLITICS, VERY LITTLE AROUND POLICY.

23:29 HOW MANY CONVERSATIONS HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT WHAT THE NEXT WHITE

23:32 HOUSE LOOKS LIKE AND WHAT KIND OF POLICIES IT WILL HAVE? LISA:

23:35 ZERO. I WAS LOOKING UP SOME OF THE

23:40 POLICIES BIDEN IS PUTTING FORWARD, AND -- WHICH WAS

23:46 BASICALLY -- IS IT GOING TO BE THIS DARK MISERABLE CAMPAIGN OF

23:50 ANGER AND FINGER-POINTING AND FAKE CATASTROPHIC TALKS?

23:55 THAT IS BASICALLY WHAT WE HEARD FROM ISAAC BOLTANKSY. TOM:

23:58 BUT THAT IS AMERICAN HISTORY.

24:00 I THINK A READING OF MANY, BUT NOT ALL, CAMPAIGNS IS

24:06 BITTERNESS. JFK, GOING BACK TO ALIEN

24:09 SEDITION IN 1804. THIS IS THE NORMAL KIND OF

24:12 PROCESS. JONATHAN: THIS FEELS THAT NORMAL TO YOU?

24:16 TOM: YES. LISA:

24:25 DO YOU REMEMBER CLIENTS ASKING IS IT GOING TO BE JAMIE DIMON

24:31 VERSUS OPRAH WINFREY, AND SHE HAD TO WRITE IT IS NOT GOING TO

24:32 BE JAMIE DIMON?

24:46 JONATHAN: STOCKS ON THE S&P 500 LOOK A

24:50 LITTLE SOMETHING LIKE THIS. EQUITY FUTURES NEGATIVE ON THE

24:51 SNP. DOWN BY .6%.

24:59 NINE WEEKS OF GAINS IN THE S&P 500. IT WAS THE LONGEST WINNING

25:05 STREAK IN -- GOING BACK TO 2004. THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THIS

25:11 RALLY AT YEAR END WAS SURELY A YEAR END SHORT SQUEEZE OR A

25:15 SIGN OF THE MACRO FUNDAMENTALS FINALLY ABOUT TO IMPROVE IN A

25:16 SUSTAINABLE MANNER? THEY DATA ON FRIDAY DID NOT

25:18 SPEAK TO THE LATTER. LISA: WHICH IS THE REASON PEOPLE ARE

25:22 LOOKING TO CPI.

25:28 WE HEARD THE SAME KIND OF TALK FROM LORI CALVASINA.

25:30 WE SAW THE NASDAQ AND THE RUSSELL 2000 UNDERPERFORM.

25:33 THIS IDEA THAT IT IS RATE CUTTING CONCERN AND CONCERNS

25:34 ABOUT ECONOMIC GROWTH. TOM:

25:40 PULLBACK FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NINE WEEKS -- PULLBACK IS

25:43 NORMAL. THE HYSTERIA ABOUT THIS IS

25:44 ORIGINAL. IT IS LIKE WE ARE ADDICTED TO

25:49 UP COME UP, AWAY IN MY BEAUTIFUL BLUE. LISA:

25:52 AM I BEING HYSTERICAL ABOUT THIS? TOM:

25:55 NO, I'M NOT SAYING YOU ARE. IS JUST IT IS ALL OVER, WE ARE

26:01 GOING TO DIE, THAT WAS THE ZEITGEIST THIS WEEK. JONATHAN:

26:04 I DID NOT SEE THAT.

26:11 -- THE FACT WE HAVE HAD THE FIRST WEEKLY LOSS SINCE OCTOBER

26:15 DOES NOT TELL YOU HOW BAD LAST WEEK WAS, IT TELLS YOU HOW

26:17 GREAT THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS HAVE BEEN.

26:19 NOVEMBER, DECEMBER VERY POWERFUL.

26:22 JPMORGAN AND BANK OF AMERICA COMING FRIDAY.

26:26 LOOKING AT THE BOND MARKET, YIELDS LOWER BY A SINGLE BASIS

26:27 POINT.

26:34 THE 10 YEAR, 10.034% -- THIS TUG OF WAR BETWEEN PAYROLLS

26:39 LOOKING GOOD ON THE SURFACE, THEN BENEATH THE SURFACE, SOME

26:42 CRACKS, THEN NOT A GREAT READ. LISA:

26:45 AND THESE PEOPLE CAME OUT AND SAID ALL THE DATA IS FUNKY AND

26:52 YOU CANNOT REALLY TRUST IT, SO THAT IS WHY PEOPLE ARE LOOKING

26:53 TO CPI. YOU THINK YOU GET SOME CLARITY,

27:01 BUT AT TIPPING POINTS, YOU DON'T, SO HOW DO YOU KNOW WHICH

27:04 DATA IS GOING TO BE THE IMPORTANT GUIDE TO FOCUS ON?

27:06 JONATHAN: ANNA WONG OF BLOOMBERG ECONOMICS -- MORE WORKERS ABLE

27:13 TO FIND JOBS, MORE PEOPLE TAKING PART-TIME WORK FOR

27:17 ECONOMIC REASONS -- THERE ARE CRACKS UNDER THE SURFACE. TOM:

27:23 THERE ARE CRACKS THERE, AND A REALLY .1 IS AN UNDERRATED GDP.

27:29 A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE HAVE A LOWER STATISTIC. JONATHAN:

27:33 THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE, THE EURO -- GUESS WHAT? LISA: WHAT.

27:38 JONATHAN: UNCHANGED. GOING ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE.

27:42 UNDER SURVEILLANCE THIS MORNING, BOEING SINKING IN

27:45 PREMARKET TRADING AS CARRIERS GROUND ITS 737 MAX 9 JET.

27:54 EIGHT PANEL BLEW OFF THE FUSELAGE OF AN ALASKA AIRLINES

27:55 JET.

28:01 THE PLANE WAS FORCED TO LAND AFTER DECOMPRESSION.

28:03 NO ONE WAS INJURED. THE GOOD NEWS IS KNOWN WAS

28:06 SITTING IN THAT SEAT. IT COULD HAVE BEEN VERY

28:08 DIFFERENT FRIDAY NIGHT. LISA: THERE COULD HAVE BEEN DEATHS.

28:15 THERE HAVE BEEN DEATHS IN PREVIOUS ACCIDENTS OF THIS

28:17 NATURE. IT RAISES A LOT OF QUESTIONS

28:20 FOR BOEING, CONSIDERING THEY HAVE HAD OTHER ISSUES.

28:25 THIS GOES BACK TO 2019 WITH THE MAX 8, THE PREVIOUS ITERATION

28:29 THAT HAD PROBLEMS. IS IT GOING TO BE A MANUFACTURING PROBLEM

28:31 OR SOMETHING STRUCTURAL THAT WILL GROUND ALL THESE PLANES

28:33 INDEFINITELY? AND HOW IS BOEING GOING TO THE

28:40 MAIN COMPETITIVE VERSUS AIRBUS WITH THIS TYPE OF CLOUD HANGING

28:41 OVER IT? TOM:

28:47 SOMEONE IN THE ZEITGEIST IS SAYING, OUR PEOPLE NOW GOING TO

28:52 GOOGLE FLIGHTS, FIGURE OUT FLIGHT THEY WILL TAKE, THEN SEE

28:57 THE PLANE AND SAY, I WILL NOT TAKE IT? JONATHAN:

29:00 I WANT HOW CLOSE WE ARE TO THAT MOMENT THESE BOEING INCIDENTS.

29:02 TOM: I KNOW THE PLANES I LOVE AND

29:05 TRY TO GO THAT WAY. LISA: I JUST SHUT MY EYES -- I CANNOT

29:08 DEAL. JONATHAN: BOEING DOWN ALMOST 9%.

29:16 YOUR NEXT STORY, CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS ANNOUNCING A BIPARTISAN

29:19 DEAL, HOPING TO AVOID A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN.

29:24 SENATE MAJORITY LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER AND SPEAKER MIKE

29:29 JOHNSON AGREEING TO A $1.59 TRILLION SPENDING CAP, AVOIDING

29:35 DEADLINES SET FOR JANUARY 19 AND FEBRUARY 2.

29:38 THE GOOD NEWS, MAYBE THE SO-CALLED RELATIVELY EASY PART

29:39 IS DEALT WITH, BUT THERE IS WORK TO BE DONE. LISA:

29:44 HERE IS THE COMMENTS FROM THE HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS -- IT IS

29:46 EVEN WORSE THAN WE THOUGHT, THIS IS A TOTAL FAILURE.

29:50 SO THAT IS THE STARTING POINT OF THE FAR RIGHT REPUBLICAN

29:52 PARTY. TOM: ISAAC BOLTANKSY SAID IT

29:53 BRILLIANTLY.

30:00 WHAT WE SAW ON THE BOARD, WE UPPED THE OPTIMISM OF THAT

30:01 SPENDING CAP.

30:07 FULL TASK HE SAID, FORGET -- BOLTANSKY SAID FORGET ABOUT IT.

30:11 JONATHAN: DID YOU SEE THE PIECE OUT OF

30:12 JPMORGAN? A FANTASTIC PIECE.

30:18 WITHIN THAT, IT TALKS THE TRAJECTORY OF U.S. DEBT.

30:22 EVERY ROUND OF FISCAL STIMULUS

30:31 BRINGS US ONE STEP CLOSER TO -- WE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO

30:32 DETERIORATING U.S. FINANCES WITH LIMITED

30:36 CONSEQUENCES.

30:42 BY THE EARLY 20 30'S, THE CBO PROJECTS ALL FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

30:45 REVENUES WILL BE CONSUMED BY ENTITLEMENT PAYMENTS AND

30:47 INTEREST ON THE FEDERAL DEBT. AT SOME POINT BETWEEN NOW AND

30:51 THEN, THERE MAY HAVE TO BE A RECKONING. LISA:

30:53 ESPECIALLY BECAUSE A LOT OF THE DEBT WE HAVE A SHORT-TERM.

30:56 IF YOU LOOK, IT IS DOUBLED GOING BACK TO .14 WITH AN

31:00 ACCELERATING CLIP.

31:06 -- IF YOU LOOK, IT HAS DOUBLED GOING BACK TO 2014 WITH AN

31:09 ACCELERATING CLIP. JONATHAN: OVER IN CONGRESS AS WELL, THERE

31:13 WILL BE A DEBATE. LET'S FINISH ON THIS STORY.

31:19 ABSOLUTELY BIZARRE. DIFFERENT SECRETARY LLOYD

31:22 AUSTIN REMAINS HOSPITALIZED BUT FACES CRITICISM AFTER FAILING

31:25 TO INFORM THE PUBLIC OF HIS CONDITION.

31:30 HE WAS SENT TO INTENSIVE CARE AFTER COMPLICATIONS FROM

31:31 SURGERY. THE WHITE HOUSE REPORTEDLY NOT

31:36 AWARE OF AUSTIN'S CONDITION UNTIL THURSDAY.

31:42 THE PENTAGON NOT PROVIDING DETAILS ON THE PROCEDURE.

31:44 WE WISH HIM THE BEST ON A SPEEDY RECOVERY, BUT DO NOT

31:47 KNOW FROM WHAT. TOM:

31:53 THE PROS ARE AGHAST. IT IS JUST A MESS, FUMBLE, BY THE BIDEN

31:54 ADMINISTRATION. JONATHAN: THE PRESIDENT DID NOT KNOW, AND

32:01 SEEMINGLY THE DEPUTY TO LLOYD AUSTIN DID NOT KNOW AS WELL.

32:04 TOM: I WILL TAKE IT BACK TO WOODROW

32:07 WILSON, BUT I AM SURE YOU CAN GO BACK TO THE 19TH CENTURY,

32:11 BUT WE NEED TO MUNICATION HERE. CERTAINLY A LACK OF IT, TO SAY

32:15 THE LEAST. WE GET COMMUNICATION NOW FROM FRANKFURT, GERMANY.

32:22 I AM MAKING A JOKE ABOUT WHAT IS OUT THERE, AND THAT IS THE

32:27 DISSENT OF DISINFLATION. WITH ALL THESE ARE -- RESEARCH

32:33 YOU HAVE AT DZBANK, IS THAT EUROPEAN MODEL, THE GLOBAL

32:36 MODEL, IS THE GLASS HALF-FULL?

32:40 >> WELL, YES. CERTAINLY WE HAVE HAD OUR SHARE

32:44 OF ISSUES OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, AND THINGS ARE LOOKING

32:45 PRETTY DIRE. I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU SAW IN

32:51 GERMANY, BUT WE HAVE MASSIVE STRIKES.

32:54 FARMS ARE STRIKING, BLOCKING HIGHWAYS.

32:55 WE HAVE A TRAIN STRIKE COMING UP. IT IS PRETTY CHAOTIC HERE.

33:02 IN TERMS OF OUR GROWTH OUTLOOK, THINGS ARE NOT LOOKING ROSY.

33:08 IN TERMS OF INFLATION, IT IS COMING DOWN, BUT IT WILL TAKE A

33:12 LONG TIME TO COVER. THINGS ARE NOT LOOKING

33:15 FANTASTIC. JONATHAN: I DID A THING ON LINKED IN

33:21 WHICH HAVE TO DO WITH EUROPE AND THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER

33:22 OF ITALY. THE BASIC IDEA IS EVERYONE

33:27 FEELS WE HAVE SORT OF GOTTEN THERE OF A PERCENT

33:30 UNEMPLOYMENT, WE HAVE GOTTEN CLEAR OF EURO SCLEROSIS.

33:35 WHAT DOES DZ BANK SAY? IS GERMANY, AND THE REST OF

33:41 EUROPE, CLEAR OF THE PLAGUE OF DECADES AGO? SONJA:

33:45 I WOULD NOT SAY ENTIRELY.

33:52 PARTICULARLY WE THINK ABOUT THAT FREEZE.

33:53 ONE OF THE ISSUES WE HAVE BEEN HAVING ACROSS EUROPE AND WHICH

33:57 CAUSED A MAJOR CRISIS OVER A YEAR AGO -- WE ARE NOT CLEAR

34:01 ABOUT AT ALL. WE HAVE HAD ALL THESE CRISES.

34:04 FISCAL POLICY HAS BEEN LOOSE.

34:10 I THINK THE STRUCTURAL REFORMS WE SO BADLY NEEDED HAVE NOT

34:13 NECESSARILY BEEN DONE, SO THERE IS STILL A LOT OF UNDERLYING

34:17 ISSUES, AND I DO NOT THINK THEY ARE BEING TACKLED. LISA:

34:23 IS THE SURPRISE OF 2024 FOR EUROPE GOING TO COME FROM CHINA

34:25 AND WHETHER THEY CAN PROVIDE SOME STIMULUS AND ACCELERATE

34:27 MORE THAN PEOPLE EXPECT? SONJA: IF THAT WERE TO HAPPEN, IT

34:32 WOULD INDEED BE A SURPRISE. CHINA IS LOOKING VERY WEAK.

34:36 THEY HAVE A MOUNTAIN OF PROBLEMS TO DEAL WITH.

34:40 WITH THE DEBT LEVELS CHINA HAS REACHED AT THIS POINT, IT HAS

34:44 LESS ABILITY TO COUNTERACT WEAKNESS.

34:46 THE OLD METHOD OF SPEND, SPEND, SPEND IS NOT REALLY WORK OR

34:48 CHINA ANYMORE. THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH ALL

34:51 THESE ISSUES. OBVIOUSLY, REAL ESTATE IS

34:53 HARD-HIT. YOU WILL NOT GET POSITIVE

34:58 GROWTH FROM CHINA, WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS WE ARE LOOKING

35:02 AT MODERATE, WEAKSIH GROWTH IN EUROPE THIS YEAR.

35:07 THERE IS NOT REALLY A SOURCE OF MAJOR ACCELERATION. LISA:

35:10 GIVEN THAT BACKDROP, IS IT PLAUSIBLE THE ECB CAN REMAIN ON

35:13 HOLD AND NOT CUT RATES AS QUICKLY AS THE FEDERAL RESERVE,

35:17 REALLY BOLSTER THIS THAT ON THE EURO VERSUS THE DOLLAR TO START

35:21 THE YEAR? SONJA: WE ALL WISH THE ECB WOULD BE

35:25 ABLE TO CUT RATES, BECAUSE THEY RATE LEVEL, AT THIS POINT, IS

35:26 VERY RESTRICTIVE. IT IS HURTING CONSUMERS,

35:30 HURTING INVESTMENT, HURTING THE REAL ESTATE SECTOR.

35:33 IT IS CAUSING CONSIDERABLE PAIN. FROM A GROWTH PERSPECTIVE, IT

35:40 WOULD BE DESIRABLE FOR IT TO COME DOWN, BUT THE ECB HAS TO

35:41 LOOK AT INFLATION. AND CORE INFLATION, SUPER COURT

35:47 INFLATION, ALL OF THAT REMAINS VERY HIGH -- SUPER CORE

35:52 INFLATION COME ALL OF REMAINS VERY HIGH. THERE IS NO LEEWAY.

35:55 TOM: THERE IS LABOR UNREST IN GERMANY.

36:00 I THINK THERE IS LABOR UNREST IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AS WELL.

36:05 THAT SPEAKS TO PERSISTENT WAGE INFLATION, A THEME FOR AMERICA,

36:07 BUT IS THAT A THEME FOR DZ BANK THAT WE SEE PERSISTENT WAGE

36:09 INFLATION? SONJA: WELL, I DO NOT KNOW WHAT MY

36:16 WEEK INCREASE WILL BE THIS YEAR, SO I DO NOT KNOW IF IT IS

36:19 A TOPIC FOR US AT DZ BANK. BUT WE HAVE HAD SIGNS, PEOPLE

36:24 ARE ASKING FOR MORE MONEY, UNDERSTANDABLY.

36:27 THIS IS WHAT I MENTIONED BEFORE. THE UNDERLYING INFLATION

36:31 PRESSURES ARE STILL VERY MUCH THERE, COMING FROM THE LABOR

36:33 MARKET. WE HAVE SEEN LABOR UNREST,

36:37 STRIKES GOING ON, AND THIS WILL CONTINUE.

36:41 FOR THE ECB TO SIGNAL IT IS TIME FOR RATES TO COME DOWN

36:43 ALREADY, IT IS TOO EARLY AND TOO RISKY.

36:47 THEY MAY RISK OF THE PROGRESS THEY HAVE ALREADY MADE ON THE

36:50 INFLATION FRONT, EVEN THOUGH, FROM AN ECONOMIC POINT OF VIEW,

36:53 IT WOULD BE DESIRABLE FOR RATES TO COME DOWN. JONATHAN:

36:58 QUICKLY, TO RECAP, FAVORITE TRADE FOR YOU AND THE TEAM THIS

37:03 YEAR? SONJA: I STILL THINK SHORT DOLLAR-YEN.

37:07 NOTHING IS HAPPENING NOW WITH THE EARTHQUAKE, BUT THE BOJ

37:10 WILL HAVE TO MOVE ON POLICY, AND SHORT DOLLAR-YEN IS AN

37:12 ATTRACTIVE TRAIT. JONATHAN: DO YOU HAVE A TIMELINE ON THAT,

37:15 WHEN THEY WILL MOVE? SONJA: SOONER RATHER THAN LATER.

37:22 INFLATION RATE IN JAPAN AS ABOVE TARGET, SO IT WILL COME

37:26 BACK TOWARDS TARGET, BUT AT THE END OF THIS YEAR.

37:29 BY THE MIDDLE OF THE YEAR, THEY WILL HAVE TO HAVE MOVED.

37:32 JONATHAN: GREAT TO CATCH UP. SONJA MARTEN OF DZ BANK.

37:38 LOOKING FOR THAT, STRONGER JAPANESE YEN AND MAY BE A MOVE

37:41 FROM THE BOJ IN THE MIDDLE OF THE. LISA:

37:47 WASN'T IT LIKE -- AT LEAST YOU HAVE A BIT MORE INFLATION AND

37:50 GROWTH FOR THEM TO GET BEHIND IN JAPAN. TOM:

37:55 THE UNION ACTIVITY IN EUROPE I AM FASCINATED BY, BECAUSE IT IS

37:58 RADICALLY DIFFERENT FROM OVER HERE.

38:02 IT WILL BE INTERESTING, AS 2024 UNFOLDS, TO SEE WHAT THAT WAGE

38:05 GROWTH, OR LACK OF WAGE GROWTH, DOES. JONATHAN:

38:11 THE DOLLAR-YEN 144.45, MOVING LOWER BY .1%.

38:15 ONE THING NOT MOVING LOWER IN A MUTED FASHION IS BOEING.

38:20 BOEING IS DOWN SOMETHING LIKE A PERCENT, 9%.

38:22 COMING UP, GEORGE FERGUSON OF BLOOMBERG INTELLIGENCE ON THE

38:25 LATEST ON BOEING. TOM:

38:27 IT IS A HUGE DEAL, MUCH BIGGER DEAL THAN EVEN HAS BEEN PLAYED

38:32 HERE. YOU WILL GET REVIEWED. LISA WILL DO TEAM COVERAGE IN

38:37 PORTLAND, HER BACKYARD. SITTING OUT AT THE BARBIE.

38:40 [LAUGHTER] JONATHAN: AND RAINING IPHONES, APPARENTLY.

38:45 LISA: TWO OF THEM THAT THEY FOUND.

38:46 TOM: NOT FUNNY. JONATHAN: IMAGINE HOW MUCH WORSE IT COULD

38:51 HAVE BEEN. ABSOLUTELY INSANE. THE LATEST FROM BLOOMBERG

38:56 INTELLIGENCE IN A MOMENT. THE BROADER PRICE ACTION ON THE

39:00 S&P, NEGATIVE BY 0.1%. FROM NEW YORK, THIS IS

39:02 BLOOMBERG.

39:19 >> WE LOOK AT BOEING'S PROCESS FOR MANUFACTURING THIS

39:25 AIRCRAFT, AT THIS STAGE OF INVESTIGATION, EVERYTHING IS IN.

39:28 WE GO VERY BROAD. NOTHING IS EXCLUDED.

39:31 IT IS PRETTY EARLY ON, BUT WE DO NOT EXCLUDE ANYTHING AT THIS

39:35 POINT OF THE INVESTIGATION. JONATHAN:

39:38 THE CHAIR OF THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD

39:42 THERE. THE FAA TEMPORARILY GROUNDING

39:45 THE MAX 9 FOR SAFETY CHECKS AFTER A FEW TO LARGE --

39:50 FUSELAGE SECTION BLEW OUT DURING AN ALASKAN AIRLINES

39:51 FLIGHT. SITUATIONS LIKE THIS ARE A

39:55 REMINDER WE MUST REMAIN FOCUSED ON CONTINUING TO IMPROVE EVERY

39:58 DAY. FORTUNATELY, NO ONE WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED.

40:04 STOCK DOWN SUMMER BETWEEN 8% AND 9%. TOM:

40:09 WHEN IN DOUBT, TALK TO AN EXPERT.

40:12 ON THE TITANIC, THERE WERE RIVETS, AND THE RIVETS FAILED.

40:19 ON A 747, THERE ARE MAYBE ONE MILLION RIVETS.

40:23 737, STILL IN THE ANCIENT TIMES OF PEACE AND METAL TOGETHER.

40:29 WHATEVER IT IS, GEORGE FERGUSON IS AN EXPERT ON THIS, ON RIVETS

40:35 AND THE LACK THEREOF THIS WEEKEND.

40:38 WAS THIS A MECHANICAL FAILURE? GEORGE:

40:41 I THINK THIS WAS A FAILURE OF FASTENERS.

40:46 I THINK THE FASTENERS WERE LACKING, IS MY GUEST. OBVIOUSLY

40:49 I AM LOOKING AT THIS FROM 50,000 FEET, BUT WE ARE NOT

40:54 FINDING PLUGS BLOWING OUT OF OTHER AIRCRAFT, WE ARE NOT

40:57 FINDING THEM BLOWING OUT OF OTHER -9'S.

41:04 THE PIECE THAT FELL AWAY, THE CLEANNESS OF WHAT FELL AWAY

41:07 FROM THE AIRPLANE, IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE ON THE PRODUCTION

41:09 LINE DID NOT INSTALL ALL OF THE FASTENERS THAT NEEDED TO BE

41:10 INSTALLED. TOM: ARE THE FASTENERS -- I AM AN

41:17 AMATEUR, I WILL CALL THEM RIVETS -- ARE THE FASTENERS THE

41:21 SAME AND UBIQUITOUS THROUGHOUT ALL OF BOEING AND, FOR THAT

41:23 MATTER, AIRBUS? GEORGE: THEY WILL OBVIOUSLY COME FROM A

41:29 LOT OF DIFFERENT MANUFACTURERS, BUT I THINK THEY WILL BE VERY

41:30 SIMILAR. AND AGAIN, I THINK THIS IS

41:33 PROBABLY A PROCESS ISSUE. I THINK SOMEONE JUST DID NOT

41:38 INSTALL THE FASTENERS OR DID NOT INSTALL ALL OF THEM, AND I

41:43 THINK IT PROBABLY LEADS BACK TO THE MANUFACTURERS OF THE

41:45 FUSELAGE, WHICH HAS HAD PROBLEMS. JONATHAN:

41:50 SPIRIT AEROSYSTEMS, FOR THOSE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE COMPANY,

41:51 HOW DO THEY FIT IN HERE? GEORGE: SPIRIT AEROSYSTEMS, OUT OF

41:59 WICHITA, MAKES THE MAJORITY OF THE BOEING 737 FUSELAGE.

42:01 THEY MAKE ALL OF THEM. THEY WERE ONCE PART OF BOEING,

42:06 SPUN OUT A COUPLE DECADES AGO NOW.

42:10 SPIRIT HAS HAD SOME CHALLENGES, LIKE THE VERTICAL STABILIZER

42:16 FASTENING ISSUE, REAR PRESSURE BULKHEAD ISSUES.

42:19 THAT HAS BEEN A LOT OF TURNOVER AT THAT COMPANY.

42:23 WITH THE PANDEMIC, A LOT OF PEOPLE LEFT AEROSPACE, THINKING

42:27 WHY DO THEY WANT TO BE IN THIS BUSINESS AFTER THEY WATCHED

42:30 MOBILE AIR TRAVEL GO ALMOST TO 0. THE REASONING UP OF THAT

42:35 WORKFORCE HAS HAD MAJOR CHALLENGES. THE U.S.

42:40 JOB MARKET IS PRETTY HOT, AND I THINK, GIVEN THE TURNOVER, THE

42:47 TRAINING REQUIRED IN AEROSPACE, THE BIG ATTENTION TO DETAIL, I

42:50 THINK IT HAS BEEN HARD FOR SPIRIT TO GET THINGS MOVING

42:53 AGAIN DOWN THERE, AND I THINK THAT IS WHAT WE WILL SPEND A

42:55 LOT OF TIME LOOKING AT. SPIRIT IS CERTAINLY THE NUMBER

42:59 ONE CONCERN FOR BOEING. LISA: WERE THEY INVOLVED WITH THAT

43:06 2019 MAX 8 ISSUES? GEORGE: YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE TWO

43:11 CRASHES OF BOEING? MCAS IS MORE OF A BOEING

43:15 SYSTEMS ISSUE. THEY ARE VERY MUCH JUST IN THE

43:22 MANUFACTURING PORTION OF THIS BUSINESS.

43:25 BUT AGAIN, I WOULD COME BACK TO, KEYED TO THE BOEING

43:31 RECOVERY -- KEY TO THE BOEING RECOVERY IS GROWTH AND DELIVERY

43:33 OF 737'S. WE WERE STARTING TO SEE THAT AS

43:37 THE YEAR ENDED IN 2023. BUT SPIRIT IS INTEGRAL TO THAT

43:41 EFFORT, THAT RECOVERY. IF BOEING DOES NOT THINGS

43:48 STABILIZED AT SPIRIT, WHERE SPIRIT IS DELIVERING QUALITY

43:52 FUSELAGES ALL THE TIME, IN THE CORRECT NUMBERS, THE RECOVERY

43:57 IS GOING TO -- BE HARD TO KEEP MOMENTUM BEHIND. LISA:

44:04 IS SPIRIT THE CHEAPEST OPTION FOR BOEING, AND THAT IS THE

44:08 REASON SPIRIT -- BOEING IS STICKING WITH THAT COMPANY,

44:10 REGARDLESS OF POTENTIAL PRODUCTION FALL? -- FLAW?

44:12 GEORGE: NO. THERE WAS AN AGREEMENT WRITTEN

44:17 IN, WENT SPIRIT WAS SPUN OUT OF BOEING, THAT WILL -- THAT THEY

44:21 WOULD BE THE PRIMARY BUILDER OF THE FUSELAGE WHILE THERE IS A

44:23 737. SPIRIT PROBABLY IS NOT THE LOWEST-COST PROVIDER.

44:31 THE ARE PROBABLY SOME THAT ARE OVERSEAS, BUT AGAIN, THE U.S.

44:33 HAS HAD REAL CHALLENGES. WE HAVE GONE THROUGH THE

44:35 PANDEMIC. WORKFORCE TURNOVER HAS BEEN

44:41 LARGE, PROBABLY LARGER THAN WE HAVE SEEN THAN IN THE EUROPEAN

44:43 AIRSPACE INDUSTRY. I THINK SPIRIT MANAGEMENT

44:48 REALLY HAS TO GET DOWN THERE AND -- ON TRAINING AND DOUBLE

44:51 DOWN ON OVERSIGHT ON THE LINE,

44:57 BECAUSE TO ME, IT APPEARS TO BE A PROBLEM ON THE LINE. JONATHAN:

45:03 THERE ARE AIRLINES WAITING FOR DELIVERY FROM BOEING AND HOPING

45:05 FOR A WRAP UP IN PRODUCTION. HOW LIKELY IS THAT ANYTIME SOON?

45:12 GEORGE: WE WILL HAVE TO SEE HOW THIS

45:13 INVESTIGATION EVOLVES.

45:21 TO ME, IT SEEMS LIKE AN ANOMALY. IT IS NOT A TERRIBLY DIFFICULT

45:28 INSTRUCTION PROCESS TO TAKE PLACE.

45:29 MOST OF THEM ARE IN THE U.S. UNITED IS THE MAJORITY.

45:33 I THINK THEY WILL PROBABLY GET THEIR ARMS AROUND THIS ISSUE

45:37 PRETTY QUICKLY. I DO THINK IT WILL LEAD TO SOME

45:40 DELAYS. I DO NOT THINK IT WILL LEAD TO

45:44 SIGNIFICANT DELAYS AT THIS POINT.

45:47 BOEING CAN PROBABLY GET THE PRODUCTION THEY WANT THIS YEAR,

45:49 PROVIDED NOTHING ELSE HAPPENS. TOM: WHAT IS THE AIRBUS-BOEING

45:52 DISTINCTION? I THINK THE ZEITGEIST IS AIRBUS

45:59 HAS A LOT OF ECONOMICS, IT IS SMOOTHER, CREAMIER IN THE

46:04 COCKPIT, AND BOEING'S TWO ENGINES MOVING FORWARD.

46:08 WHAT IS THE AIRBUS-BOEING DISTINCTION FROM AN ENGINEERING

46:10 STANDPOINT? GEORGE: I THINK YOU ARE RIGHT.

46:18 THE AIRBUS COCKPIT IS PROBABLY BUILT MORE AROUND THE PILOT OR

46:22 BUILT AROUND THE COMPUTER WHERE BOEING IS BUILT, PERHAPS, A

46:25 LITTLE MORE AROUND THE PILOT AND THE PILOT'S SKILLS.

46:29 THE ZEITGEIST RIGHT NOW, I DON'T KNOW.

46:35 WHEN I THINK OF THESE TWO COMPANIES, AIRBUS IS DOING A

46:37 MUCH BETTER JOB OF EXECUTING. THE AIRBUS SUPPLY CHAIN HAS

46:41 CHALLENGES, BUT IT APPEARS THEY ARE MORE ON TOP OF THOSE

46:44 CHALLENGES, AND THEY ARE GETTING MORE QUALITY TO THEIR

46:50 LINES AND THROUGH THEIR LINES, AND THAT IS ALLOWING THEM TO

46:52 BUILD MORE AIRPLANES, AND THEY ARE TAKING MARKET SHARE HERE.

46:56 RIGHT NOW, AIRBUS LOOKS LIKE QUALITY, BOEING LOOKS LIKE

47:00 CHALLENGES. THE REAL BIG CHALLENGE IS IF

47:03 YOU ARE A FLEET MANAGER AND YOU WANT AN AIRPLANE, YOU COULD GET

47:11 IN THE BACK OF THE LINE FOR THE A320, WHICH IS SIX OR SEVEN

47:14 YEARS LONG, OR YOU GET IN THE BACK OF THE BOEING LINE AND

47:17 BEFORE FIVE YEARS OUT.

47:23 THE AIRLINES ARE NOT NECESSARILY TAKING THE PLANES

47:25 SOON, BUT THERE ARE NOT A LOT OF OTHER SETTLERS IN TOWN, IF

47:26 YOU WILL. LISA: QUICKLY, BASED ON WHAT YOU

47:32 SAID, IF THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH THE WORKFORCE AND SOME OF THE

47:36 DISRUPTIONS FROM COVID, DOES THAT MEAN POST-COVID AIR TRAVEL

47:37 IS A WHOLE LOT LESS SAFE? GEORGE:

47:42 I WILL SAY WE HAVE HAD OUR CHALLENGES COMING OUT OF THE

47:45 PANDEMIC AS WE BROUGHT THE WORKFORCE -- THE WORKFORCE GOT

47:46 DEPLETED, AND WE HAD TO REJUVENATE THE WORKFORCE.

47:49 THAT IS A CHALLENGE. WHEN YOU HAVE NEW PEOPLE IN THE

47:55 INDUSTRY LEARNING THEIR JOBS, YOU'RE JUST NOT GOING TO HAVE

47:58 THE SAME LEVEL OF SAFETY, THE SAME LEVEL OF SKILL YOU HAD

48:01 PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC. JONATHAN: THAT IS WORRYING. GEORGE:

48:07 I STILL TRAVEL, THOUGH, SO I STILL THINK IT IS A REALLY SAFE

48:10 SYSTEM, BUT PROBABLY NOT AS SAFE AS PRE-PANDEMIC. JONATHAN:

48:14 GEORGE FERGUSON, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

48:17 TO GIVE YOU AN UPDATE, SPIRIT AEROSYSTEMS, NOT TO BE CONFUSED

48:20 WITH SPIRIT AIRLINES, IS DOWN BY MORE THAN 18% IN THE

48:22 PREMARKET. BOEING IS DOWN BY MORE THAN 8%.

48:26 LISA: THAT IS REALLY ALARMING. NOT AS SAFE AS IT WAS

48:31 PRE-PANDEMIC. THAT IS NOT REALLY COMFORTING.

48:35 I USED TO GET VERY NERVOUS BEFORE I FLEW AS A LITTLE KID.

48:40 AND ALL THE STORIES COMING OUT NOW -- IT IS STILL VERY SAFE,

48:42 YOU CAN FLY -- THEY ARE COMING OUT FOR A REASON, GIVEN SOME OF

48:45 THESE ACCIDENTS. TOM: I GOT LUCKY.

48:49 I WAS IN THE FANCY SEATS ONE TIME -- JONATHAN:

48:52 JUST ONCE -- TOM: AND I TURNED AROUND AND LOOKED

48:55 BACK AND THERE WAS A WOMAN ON THE CEILING OF THE AIRPLANE.

48:59 WHEN I SAW THAT, IT WAS LIKE, OK. JONATHAN:

49:02 HOW MANY TANGS IN WERE YOU? [LAUGHTER] TOM:

49:07 I WAS DEEP IN THE TANGS. I TURNED BACK AND THERE WAS A

49:12 WOMAN ON THE CEILING. WEAR YOUR SEATBELT. JONATHAN:

49:16 AMAZING. TOM: WEAR YOUR SEATBELT IS THE

49:18 ANSWER. [LAUGHTER] LISA: PLEASE. JONATHAN:

49:25 DON'T CONSUME THOSE BEVERAGES ON THE PLANE -- LISA:

49:45 >> WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN IN A LABOR MARKET

49:46 RECESSION.

49:46 >> YOU REALLY HAVE TO QUESTION WHETHER THE ECONOMY IS SLOWING

49:55 DOWN AT ALL.

49:58 >> WE ARE SEEING SIGNS OF CONCERNS THAT MAKES US WRITE

50:00 ABOUT THE SUSTAINABILITY.

50:04 >> THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT SUSTAINABLY IS TO HAVE A BOOM

50:06 IN PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH.

50:12 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE OF TOM KEENE,

50:15 JONATHAN FERRO AND LISA ABRAMOWICZ. JONATHAN:

50:19 GOOD MORNING.

50:27 ALONGSIDE TOM KEENE AND LISA ABRAMOWICZ.

50:30 FOLLOWING THE FIRST WEEKLY LOSS

50:36 ON THE S&P 500 GOING BACK TO OCTOBER.

50:40 EARNINGS FOR THE BIG BANKS, KICKING OFF FRIDAY. TOM:

50:46 FOR THE BANKS IT WILL BE A VIEW MEASUREMENT OF THE ECONOMY.

50:50 ON THE INFLATION SIDE, I FOUND A VERY MIXED.

50:55 THE FIRST THING I DID TODAY WAS TO LOOK AT THE SCREEN AND I

50:58 WOULD CALL IT A JUNGLE THIS WEEK.

51:05 THIS JONATHAN: WE CONTINUE TO PROJECT A SOFT

51:09 LANDING FOR THE LABOR MARKET. WILL THE DATA THAT WE GET THIS

51:13 WEEK SPEAK TO THAT? LISA: WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WHAT COULD

51:21 GO WRONG AFTER REALLY MESSY DATA ON FRIDAY.

51:27 THE NUMBER OF TAKES THAT I READ -- WHAT THAT SAID ABOUT THE

51:31 ECONOMY RANGED FROM YOU HAVE TO TRUST HEADLINE NUMBER TO ALL OF

51:36 THIS DATA IS MESSY AND YOU CANNOT TRUST ANYTHING.

51:40 THEY WERE EACH PICKING OUT THEIR OWN QUADRANT TO FOCUS ON.

51:45 JONATHAN: WHAT COULD GO WRONG?

51:53 SOUNDS -- IN OUR VIEW, RATE CUT IS DISAPPOINTED.

51:55 THAT IS WHAT CAN GO WRONG. TOM: IT IS OUT THERE.

52:04 SOMEONE WAS OVER BULLISH OR OVER CAUTIONARY.

52:11 JOHN, YOU DEVOLVE FROM DOUBLE DEBIT -- DOUBLE-DIGIT OMG TO

52:17 OVER THE MOON RETURNS AND SINGLE-DIGIT RETURNS.

52:19 HOW BORING. HOW BORING.

52:25 IT IS A MONDAY. JONATHAN:

52:31 -- TOM: IT IS A MONDAY. JONATHAN: OK. NEGATIVE BY 0.1%.

52:41 TRACKING LOWER. MORE TO COME ON THAT A LITTLE

52:43 BIT LATER. LISA: WE WILL ALSO HEAR ABOUT WHY YOU

52:49 SHOULD WEAR A SEATBELT. FIRST ONE, CPI COMING.

52:57 HOW MUCH IT REALLY DOES DRIP BACK DOWN TO THAT SOFT LANDING

53:00 NARRATIVE. I WILL THROW ANOTHER NARRATIVE

53:05 INTO THE MIX. WE HAVE TREASURY OPTIONS AND WE

53:11 ARE TALKING ABOUT THE QUESTION OF THE RISING ISSUANCE.

53:17 OUTSTANDING PUBLIC DEBT FROM THE U.S.

53:25 GOVERNMENT HAS RISEN. YOU HAVE THREE YEAR, 10 YEAR AND

53:27 THIRTY-YEAR NOTES BEING AUCTIONED THIS WEEK.

53:33 TO ME, THAT WILL BE TELLING. JP MORGAN KICKING OFF ALL OF

53:34 THAT. BANK OF AMERICA ALSO REPORTING

53:37 THAT DAY.

53:43 OVER THE PAST YEAR, JP MORGAN WITH SHARES OF 25%.

53:48 THAT IS THE DISPARITY THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. JONATHAN:

53:54 THE DISTINCTION FOR THAT STORY, VERY DIFFERENT.

54:00 SHANNON, WONDERFUL TO HEAR FROM YOU AND CATCH UP IN THE NEW

54:02 YEAR.

54:03 WE HAVE TALKED A LOT ABOUT COMPANIES BUT TALKED VERY

54:09 LITTLE ABOUT EUROPE. WHY IS THE TEAM SO CONSTRUCTIVE

54:14 ON THE YEAR AHEAD?

54:18 >> I AGREE WITH WHAT YOU SAID FOR HER.

54:21 WE HAD A GOOD YEAR LAST YEAR. IT IS OVERSHADOWED BY THE BIG

54:27 TECH STOCKS IN THE U.S. DOING INCREDIBLY WELL, BUT

54:31 EUROPE, MORE THAN 20% LAST YEAR. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT SOMETHING

54:41 MORE NARROW EUROPE HAD A GREAT YEAR LAST

54:42 YEAR. TALKING ABOUT EARNINGS AS WELL.

54:48 VALUATION IS NOT THAT EXPENSIVE. 12, 12 .5.

54:57 NOT EXPENSIVE, GOOD EARNINGS, NOT A BAD PLACE TO BE. TOM:

55:03 IF I GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING, EARLY JANUARY 2020, BASICALLY

55:07 THE U.S. HAS DONE A DOUBLE OFF OF

55:12 EUROPE, UP 11% OR SO. GREAT. NOW, FORWARD.

55:19 PEOPLE IN EUROPE, OUR GOLDMAN SACHS CLIENTS IN EUROPE

55:23 INSISTING THAT THEY NEED AMERICAN TECH?

55:27 >> THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION. GENERALLY SPEAKING, WHAT YOU

55:31 CANNOT GET IN EUROPE OR WHAT YOU FIND TRICKY TO GET IS GOOD,

55:34 STRONG GROWTH. WHAT YOU CAN GET IS CHEAP

55:37 EVALUATIONS. YOU CAN GET SOME MODEST GROWTH

55:45 STOCKS AS WELL, BUT HIGH-GROWTH IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO GET

55:46 IN EUROPE. THERE IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A

55:55 BIG GLOBAL INVESTOR. BIG, LIQUID COMPANIES THAT CAN

55:58 GIVE YOU THAT REACH. THE OTHER CRITICISM THAT I HAVE

56:05 OF EUROPE AT THE MOMENT IS, IT IS MORE EXPOSED TO CHINA THAN

56:07 THE U.S. IS. SO A LOT OF IT HAS BEEN CHINA

56:10 DRIVEN.

56:17 TOM: WHAT DOES THE GERMAN SLOWDOWN,

56:21 THE OVERALL GERMAN ECONOMIC CHALLENGE HAVE TO STOCK 600

56:23 INVESTMENT?

56:27 >> I AM PROBABLY A LITTLE LESS WORRIED ABOUT THAT THAN CHINA.

56:31 IT IS GLOBAL TRADE GROWTH COMING DOWN.

56:37 CHINA'S DOMESTIC DEMAND HAS WEEKEND SO IT IS THE SAME TYPE

56:38 OF ISSUE. IT GROWS BASED ON EXPORTING TO

56:46 CHINA AND CHEAP ENERGY. NOW NEITHER OF THOSE THINGS ARE

56:47 IN PLACE. MASSIVE INDUSTRY FOR THE STOCK

56:53 MARKET AND THE ECONOMY BEING

56:59 HIT BY THAT MOVE. ABSOLUTELY, I THINK GERMANY HAS

57:04 SOME PROBLEMS, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE GEOGRAPHICAL SALES,

57:09 SALES , EXPOSURE TO GERMANY IS NOT THAT BIG.

57:16 THE BIGGEST IS ACTUALLY THE U.S. , THREE TIMES THE SIZE OF

57:17 GERMANY. SO YES, I THINK GERMANY IS

57:24 FLATLINING AT VENICE BUT IT DOES NOT MATTER AS MUCH FOR

57:30 OVERALL EUROPEAN DEMAND, AS PEOPLE THINK. LISA:

57:38 ESPECIALLY -- THIS IS A QUESTION IF THE MAGNIFICENT

57:39 SEVEN OF EUROPE LOOK DIFFERENT THAN THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN IN

57:43 THE U.S. AND I'M TALKING TO SOME DEGREE

57:48 AIRBUS.

57:52 >> TOTALLY, OR COMMODITIES COMPANIES DEPENDENT ON GLOBAL

57:54 DEMAND.

58:00 I THINK THIS SORT OF EXPOSURE IS NOT ZERO. I CANNOT DENY THAT.

58:06 YOU ARE MORE EXPOSED TO THAT THAN OTHER REGIONS.

58:10 BUT OTHER REGIONS HAVE THEIR REASONS AS WELL.

58:15 OBVIOUSLY, ASIA IS MUCH MORE EXPOSED TO THAT IN EUROPE.

58:23 EUROPE HAS ITS PROBLEMS WITH IT TRADING EVEN LOWER THAN THAT.

58:26 IT IS REASONABLY WELL PRICED AS WELL. LISA:

58:33 YOU MENTIONED SOMETHING WITH EUROPEAN BANKS.

58:35 I'M WONDERING IF THE ECB IS GOING TO BE CUTTING RATES, IS

58:40 THAT A GOOD THING OR A BAD THING FOR FINANCIALS?

58:46 >> I WAS VERY CONVINCED BY EUROPEAN BANKS LAST YEAR.

58:48 WE DOWNGRADED RIGHT AT THE END OF THE YEAR TO A NEUTRAL.

58:52 I WOULD NOT BE WORRIED ABOUT EUROPEAN BANKS.

58:56 I SEE IT AS A NEUTRAL. WE DO SEE THE ECB CUTTING RATES

59:00 QUITE CONSISTENTLY. THE BANK OF ENGLAND AS WELL,

59:06 CUTTING RATES FROM MAY. THEY ARE PROBABLY ON BALANCE,

59:12 BUT EQUALLY, WE THINK GROWTH WILL BE OK.

59:15 I THINK THAT INTEREST RATES WILL BE HIGHER AT THE END OF

59:18 THIS CYCLE THAN THEY WERE AT THE END OF LAST CYCLE, SO I DO

59:23 NOT FEEL THE BACKDROP IS THAT BAD.

59:28 THEY ARE BUYING BACK SHARES AND DIVIDENDS.

59:33 THEY ARE VERY GOOD CASH FLOWS AT THE MOMENT.

59:39 JONATHAN: IS THERE AN UNDERLYING CURRENCY

59:41 CALL THAT YOU ARE MAKING ALONGSIDE THIS?

59:45 >> IT IS INTERESTING. EUROPE OFTEN DOES QUITE WELL

59:51 WITH EURO RISES. IT SOUNDS BECAUSE EUROPEAN

59:54 COMPANIES ARE GLIBLY EXPOSED. IF THE EURO IS RISING, THAT

01:00:01 COULD -- THAT SHOULD MAKE IT MORE TRICKY THEM UP OF THE YEAR

01:00:05 OF RISING IS NORMALLY A GOOD SIGNAL THAT EUROPE IS NOT ABOUT

01:00:06 TO BREAK UP.

01:00:12 SO, WE DO HAVE THE EURO RISING AND WE HAD IT RISING TO ABOUT

01:00:14 112. IT IS 109 AT THE MOMENT.

01:00:22 SO A RISE IN THE EURO. I THINK WE ARE ABOUT 127 AT THE

01:00:25 MOMENT. BUT THIS, THAT REFLECTS THE

01:00:31 FACT THAT GLOBAL GROWTH WILL BE OK. WE THINK U.S.

01:00:36 INTEREST RATES ARE ALSO PEEKING AND WE WILL SEE RATES FROM

01:00:37 MARCH ONWARDS.

01:00:43 IT IS A RECIPE TO A SLIGHTLY WEAKER DOLLAR. JONATHAN:

01:00:50 LOOKING FOR HIGH SINGLE DIGIT GAINS.

01:00:54 EUROPEAN EQUITIES THIS YEAR. TOM:

01:00:58 I LOOK AT THE EUROPEAN INDEX AND THE STANDARD 500.

01:01:02 THERE IS, IN-YOUR-FACE, THE TECH DISTINCTION OF AMERICA.

01:01:07 NESTLE -- THAT IS TECHIE.

01:01:14 THEY ARE DAILY, LIKE NUMBER 10. IT IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN

01:01:18 THE TECH DOMINANCE. JONATHAN: REALLY EXPRESSING THE FX MARKET

01:01:23 AS WELL.

01:01:29 127 ON THE POUND AGAINST THE DOLLAR AND LOOKING FOR A 12 AND

01:01:33 135 RESPECTIVELY THIS YEAR. LISA:

01:01:36 BECAUSE OF THE GROWTH IN THE REGION, IT WILL FOSTER BETTER

01:01:37 EARNINGS CALLS.

01:01:38 EUROPEAN BANKS HAD THEIR BEST YEAR EVER VERSUS U.S.

01:01:48 BANKS LAST YEAR.

01:01:51 WHAT IS UNDERVALUED OR OVERVALUED? JONATHAN:

01:01:55 THE BANK OF AMERICA WAS REALLY UNDER THE MICROSCOPE. TOM:

01:01:59 WE WILL BE UNDER THE MICROSCOPE, INCLUDING THIS WEEK

01:02:03 WHEN WE SEE J.P. MORGAN. JONATHAN:

01:02:04 WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM. EQUITIES FUTURES, YIELDS MOVING

01:02:11 A LITTLE BIT HIGHER BY A SINGLE BASIS POINT.

01:02:17 THE NEXT STOP FOR THIS BOND MARKET, I ON THURSDAY.

01:02:25 CONTINUING TO SPEAK TO THAT DISINFLATIONARY TREND.

01:02:27 RATE CUTS SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. TOM:

01:02:36 I LOOK AT THE ANNUALIZED AND SOME OF THE COMPENDIUMS OF WHAT

01:02:38 YOU LOOK AT, WHATEVER WAY YOU PLAY WITH THE NUMBERS, THE FACT

01:02:42 THAT DISINFLATION IS IN ORDER.

01:02:48 MY QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU GET FLATNESS? WHAT IS THE TIMELINE?

01:02:51 THAT, TO ME IS THE MYSTERY. HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO GET

01:02:56 THERE? THAT IS A COMPLETE MYSTERY.

01:03:03 JONATHAN: TALKING ABOUT WE PRAISE -- WE

01:03:06 PRICING RATES HIGHER.

01:03:13 JIM HAS A VERY SIMILAR VIEW ON ALL OF THAT, REPRICING RATES

01:03:16 HIGHER. IT COULD BE A BIG RISK IN THE

01:03:19 YEAR AHEAD.

01:03:25 COMING UP NEXT, BLOOMBERG AND THE MIDDLE EAST. WE WILL TALK

01:03:28 ABOUT TENSIONS IN JUST A MOMENT. EQUITY FUTURES SHAPING UP LIKE

01:03:31 FOLLOWS. THE ARE JUST ABOUT NEGATIVE.

01:03:37 LET US CALL IT UNCHANGED. HIGHER BY A SINGLE BASIS POINT.

01:03:45 4.06% ON A U.S. 10 YEAR YIELD. FROM NEW YORK, GOOD MORNING.

01:04:41 >> WE REJECT THE STATEMENTS. THESE STATEMENTS ARE

01:04:45 INFLAMMATORY AND ONLY MAKE IT HARDER.

01:04:51 WITH HAMAS NO LONGER IN CONTROL AND TERRORIST GROUPS NO LONGER

01:04:52 TO THREATEN SECURITY. JONATHAN: THAT WAS INTIMATE BLINKEN.

01:05:02 THE LATEST TOUR, WONDERING IF THE CONFLICT COULD EASILY

01:05:03 SPREAD. WE WILL PICK UP ON THAT IN A

01:05:04 MOMENT.

01:05:05 IT LOOKS A LITTLE BIT LIKE THIS ON THE S&P 500, GOING

01:05:15 ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE.

01:05:16 CRUDE AT VARIOUS TIMES THREATENED TO BREAK OUT.

01:05:20 BECKY DOWN BY 3%. TOM:

01:05:26 WE HAVE NOT SAID ENOUGH ABOUT THIS.

01:05:31 I'M STILL THUNDERSTRUCK AND U.S. HAS BROUGHT ON A LOT OF SUPPLY.

01:05:38 JONATHAN: 13 MILLION BARRELS A DAY. TOM:

01:05:48 WE ARE GOING TO DIGRESS AT THE BEGINNING.

01:05:49 BOBBY JOINS US FROM BLOOMBERG OPINION AS WELL.

01:05:56 GOING BACK TO 1919, HE IS BLIND IN HIS LEFT EYE AND HAS HAD THE

01:05:59 MAJOR STROKES AFTER A HISTORY OF STROKE.

01:06:03 WOODROW WILSON WAS FRAGILE.

01:06:10 AND SET UP AN ARCHITECTURE OF IDENTIFICATION OF ILL PEOPLE AT

01:06:12 THE SENIOR LEVEL. SHOULD WE BE IN AN UPROAR IF

01:06:18 THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE WAS ILL OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF

01:06:25 DAYS?

01:06:26 >> THE PRESIDENT DID NOT KNOW ABOUT IT FOR FOUR DAYS.

01:06:29 WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE THERE ARE TWO RAGING WARS WITH

01:06:31 STRONG U.S. INTERESTS. ISIS IS ACTIVE AGAIN.

01:06:40 THERE ARE CRISES AFTER CRISES, AFTER CRISES.

01:06:44 THE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S. DID NOT KNOW THAT HIS SECRETARY

01:06:46 OF DEFENSE WAS OUT OF POCKET.

01:06:52 THERE ARE POLITICAL IS DESIGNED TO STOP SOMETHING FROM THAT

01:06:53 HAPPENING. THEY BROKE DOWN, SOMETHING MORE

01:06:59 SERIOUS THAN APOLOGY FROM THE DEFENSE SECRETARY. TOM:

01:07:07 I THINK IT WILL FOCUS ON PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE.

01:07:08 WHAT SHOULD BE THE RESPONSE OF THE WHITE HOUSE?

01:07:12 >> THE WHITE HOUSE SHOULD DEMAND SOMETHING MORE

01:07:17 SUBSTANTIATIVE THAN AN APOLOGY AND THE PRESIDENT HAS TO FIGURE

01:07:21 OUT WHETHER HE IS SATISFIED WITH THE ANSWER THAT HE GETS

01:07:24 FROM THE SECRETARY ABOUT MY HE WAS INCOMMUNICADO FOR SO LONG.

01:07:31 OR WHY THE RIGHT WAS NOT TOLD THIS. IT SEEMS LIKE A BASIC AND

01:07:36 SIMPLE MISTAKE TO MAKE. THIS HAPPENED IN MAJOR

01:07:40 CORPORATIONS, HEADS WOULD ROLL. JONATHAN:

01:07:45 THERE WAS A TERRORIST ATTACK IN MAN. WHAT WAS THE COMMUNICATION

01:07:48 BETWEEN THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE PENTAGON AT THAT TIME?

01:07:52 SHOULD THEY HAVE FOUND OUT WHERE THE DEFENSE SECRETARY WAS

01:07:53 AT THAT POINT?

01:07:54 >> THEY SHOULD HAVE. JONATHAN: WHAT HAPPENED?

01:08:00 DID NO ONE TALK TO EACH OTHER WHEN THAT HAPPENED?

01:08:05 >> IT SEEMS LIKE THE DEPUTY WAS RESPONDING TO QUERIES.

01:08:12 WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THE SECRETARY'S ASSISTANT WAS

01:08:16 THEMSELVES IN BED WITH THE FLU. THIS IS WHERE ALL THE

01:08:20 COMMUNICATIONS BROKE DOWN. THAT DOES NOT STRIKE ME AS A

01:08:28 SATISFACTORY ANSWER THAT IF ONE PERSON HAS THE FLU -- THAT

01:08:31 CANNOT BE RIGHT, NOT IN THIS DAY AND AGE. LISA:

01:08:35 THERE HAS BEEN OUTRAGE FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE IN

01:08:39 ORDER TO GET MORE INFORMATION. YOU MENTIONED TWO RAGING WARS.

01:08:46 ONE OF THEM, WE STARTED THE SEGMENT WITH ANTONY BLINKEN

01:08:51 TALKING ABOUT A PROFOUND MOMENT OF TENSION, A MOMENT THAT COULD

01:08:55 EAT IT -- EASILY METASTASIZE AND CAUSE MORE SUFFERING.

01:08:59 WE ARE HEARING MORE NEWS ABOUT STRIKES BY ISRAEL AGAINST

01:09:04 HEZBOLLAH IN LEBANON. IS THIS DE-ESCALATION THAT

01:09:06 ANTONY BLINKEN WAS TALKING ABOUT?

01:09:12 >> THIS IS A BIGGER STEP BY THE ISRAELIS THAN THE ASSASSINATION

01:09:17 OF THE HAMAS LEADER IN BEIRUT, LAST WEEK.

01:09:21 THIS IS A HEZBOLLAH LEADER. WHEN THE HAMAS LEADER WAS

01:09:26 KILLED, HEZBOLLAH HAD A DEGREE OF SEPARATION.

01:09:32 THEY COULD -- AND PRIVATE THEY COULD SAY, THIS IS NOT OUR GUY

01:09:35 THAT WAS KILLED AND WE DO NOT HAVE TO RESPOND FEROCIOUSLY.

01:09:39 WHEN THEIR OWN GUY IS KILLED, IT WILL BE MUCH HARDER FOR THEM

01:09:43 TO JUSTIFY ANYTHING SHORT OF A MAJOR RESPONSE.

01:09:49 THE POTENTIAL FOR ESCALATION IS REALLY GREAT. LISA:

01:09:55 THE ROLE OF SOME OF THE U.S. WARSHIPS.

01:09:57 PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS AS TRYING TO STRIKE BACK OR

01:10:01 DETER HEZBOLLAH. IS IT TO DETER EVERYONE FROM

01:10:03 DOING ANYTHING? WHAT IS THE ACTUAL ROLE OF

01:10:12 TROOPS THAT ARE STATIONED ABOUT WHAT THE U.S. ROLE SHOULD BE?

01:10:18 >> THEY DO NOT WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN ANY FIGHTING.

01:10:21 BUT WHEN IT FAILS, WHAT HAPPENS? THERE IS THIS OLD CLICHE THAT

01:10:32 IF THERE IS A GUN ON THE MANTELPIECE IN THE FIRST ACT,

01:10:35 THAN BY THE THIRD ACT, THAT GUN HAS TO BE FIRED.

01:10:38 THAT IS WHAT I WORRY ABOUT TAKING PLACE HERE.

01:10:43 IF WE LEARNED ANYTHING FROM THE HISTORY OF THE U.S.

01:10:47 IN THE MIDDLE EAST, THE LAW OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IS NOT

01:10:55 OUR FRIEND. JONATHAN:

01:10:57 WE HAVE NOT SPOKEN SINCE THEY HAD TO GO THROUGH THE SOUTHERN

01:10:58 TIP OF SOUTH AFRICA. DO YOU SEE THAT BEING RESOLVED

01:11:00 ANYTIME SOON?

01:11:07 >> WE HAVE GOTTEN A COALITION TOGETHER.

01:11:09 THERE IS A FLOTILLA OF SHIPS IN THE RED SEA.

01:11:14 THEY HAVE BEEN ISSUED WITH A WARNING, BUT THEY ARE

01:11:16 DISREGARDING IT. THEY ISSUED AN ULTIMATUM.

01:11:26 WHAT ARE YOU PREPARED TO DO? SHIPPING COMPANIES, I DO NOT

01:11:31 BLAME THEM FOR TAKING THE ZERO RISK POLICY.

01:11:36 THEY HAVE ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY AT STAKE, PEOPLE AT

01:11:39 STAKE, SHIPS AT STAKE. I UNDERSTAND WHY THEY DO NOT

01:11:44 WANT TO GO INTO THOSE WATERS. I CAN SEE WHY THEY WOULD WANT

01:11:49 TO CONTINUE FIRING OFF THEIR MISSILES BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT

01:11:51 PAID THE PRICE. AT WHAT POINT DO THEY HAVE TO

01:11:53 PAY THE PRICE? TOM: WE USED TO KEEP CAREFUL COUNT

01:11:58 OF HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE IN IRAQ. THERE IS A FABULOUS CHART

01:12:09 SHOWING THE MANY POCKETS OF AMERICANS ACROSS THE MIDDLE

01:12:13 EAST. I WAS CAUGHT BY HOW MANY IT SUMS UP TO.

01:12:18 DO WE HAVE A LOT OF AMERICAN MILITARY IN THE MIDDLE EAST?

01:12:25 >> WE JUST REACT OUR DEAL WITH QATAR TO MAINTAIN THE

01:12:26 AMERICAN-BASED THERE. THAT MIGHT BE THE MOST

01:12:32 IMPORTANT PIECE OF THIS COMPLEX NETWORK.

01:12:37 WE STILL HAVE TROOPS IN IRAQ AND THEY ARE COMING UNDER

01:12:40 CONSTANT ATTACK BY MILITIAS ASSOCIATED WITH IRAN.

01:12:45 JUST LAST WEEK OF THE U.S. TOOK OUT THE LEADERS -- THE

01:12:48 LEADER OF ONE OF THE MILITIAS. IT MIGHT SEEM LIKE THE IRAQ WAR

01:12:55 IS WAY BEHIND US IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR, BUT THE FACT

01:12:58 IS ON THE GROUND FOR THE AMERICAN SOLDIERS WHO WERE

01:12:59 THERE, NOT SO MUCH. JONATHAN:

01:13:05 GOING BACK TO THE DISAPPEARING ACT OF THE DEFENSE SECRETARY OF

01:13:07 THE U.S. LISA, YOU CAN MOVE ON FROM

01:13:12 THIS, I GET THAT. BUT IT IS NOT LIKE IT IS QUIET.

01:13:15 IT IS ANYTHING BUT. LISA:

01:13:21 IS THE WHITE HOUSE GOING TO HOLD SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

01:13:24 RESPONSIBLE FOR VIOLATING CHAIN OF COMMAND AND GIVING THE WHITE

01:13:29 HOUSE A HEADS UP ABOUT THE SHIFT IN LEADERSHIP? JONATHAN:

01:13:35 I'M JUST WONDERING WHO SPOKE TO WHO? WAS THERE NO CONVERSATION

01:13:40 BETWEEN THE WHITE HOUSE AND DEFENSE SECRETARY WHEN THOSE

01:13:44 THINGS WERE HAPPENING? TOM: I AGREE.

01:13:46 IT IS ABOUT THE HISTORY OF AMERICA.

01:13:50 WE HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT ON THIS.

01:14:06 JONATHAN: WE ARE COMING OFF THE LAST

01:14:10 WEEKLY. THE BULLS IN THE MARKET HAS

01:14:12 BEEN ABSOLUTELY SPOILED. KICKING OFF 2024.

01:14:20 SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE ON THE S&P 500, DOWN 0.04%.

01:14:25 THE NASDAQ IS TRYING TO RALLY COME UP BY 0.07%.

01:14:29 TONNAGE OF THE MARKET, THE 30 YEAR.

01:14:33 UP A BULLY -- UP A BULLY -- UPDATE BASIS POINT PARTITA BMO.

01:14:38 ALMOST 4.40.

01:14:45 WE TALKED ABOUT THAT TUG-OF-WAR ON FRIDAY.

01:14:46 PAY RULES LOOK PRETTY DECENT AND THEN LITERALLY 19 MINUTES

01:14:51 RATED WE GOT THE SERVICES, AND THAT DID NOT LOOK GOOD AT ALL.

01:14:54 LISA: RISING BACK INTO A RATE CUT

01:14:59 AFTER BASICALLY PRICING IT OUT. A 50-50 CHANCE.

01:15:05 HERE IS THE QUESTION. WHAT DATA DO YOU TRUST AND IS

01:15:08 THERE A SIGNAL FOR THE MESSINESS THAT WE ARE AT A

01:15:12 TURNING POINT, BUT WE DO NOT KNOW WHERE WE ARE?

01:15:14 IS THIS A SLOWDOWN? JONATHAN: IT FELT THAT WAY, BUT WE DO NOT

01:15:18 KNOW. THE TWO YEAR YIELD, JUST TO

01:15:27 PICK OUT ONE SECURITY, THAT NOTE, TOTALLY UNCHANGED AT THE

01:15:29 CLOSE ON WRITING AFTER ALL OF THAT INFORMATION. TOM:

01:15:34 I LOOKED AT THE CLOSE AND I SAW THIS NAME THING AS WELL.

01:15:37 I THINK PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE A CLUE HERE.

01:15:43 IT IS AS BASIC AS CLIPPING A COUPON OR DO THE TOTAL RETURN

01:15:47 AFTER WHAT WE SAW IN 2023. THAT IS A TOUGHER QUESTION.

01:15:53 JONATHAN: 109 WHAT HE ONE. TOM:

01:15:59 THE FX COVERAGE ON SURVEILLANCE. JONATHAN:

01:16:07 THEY ARE CALLING ON DARLING, ULTIMATELY, THEY ARE LOOKING

01:16:11 FOR A BETTER GLOBAL BACK AND OFF OF THAT, A WEAKER DOLLAR.

01:16:16 LISA: I LOVE THESE EXCITING CALLS.

01:16:18 CRAZY. JONATHAN: ENOUGH WITH THAT.

01:16:22 THERE IS SOME -- WHEN THERE IS SOME PRICE ACTION, WE WILL

01:16:32 BRING IT TO YOU.

01:16:36 CARE USE AROUND THE WORLD GROUND AFTER A PANEL FLEW OFF

01:16:40 ON FRIDAY. U.S. OFFICIALS FINDING A KEY PIECE

01:16:46 OF EVIDENCE IN THE INVESTIGATION, LOCATING THE

01:16:53 PANEL IN THE BACKYARD OF A PORTLAND-BASED FEATURE.

01:16:58 NO ONE WAS HURT AFTER ALL OF THIS. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.

01:17:01 LISA: IT FELL FROM THE EYE INTO SOME

01:17:07 GUY'S BACKYARD AND NOBODY GOT HURT. IT BLEW OFF OF A PLANE.

01:17:13 TO YOUR POINT, THIS IS LUCKY. IT IS AN ABSURD POINT WHERE YOU

01:17:16 HAVE TO WONDER WHAT WENT WRONG AND HOW ENDEMIC IS THIS TO

01:17:24 CERTAIN BILLING PLANES -- BOEING PLANES. TOM:

01:17:33 IF I AM AT UNITED AIRLINES TODAY, YOU HAVE -- NOT TODAY

01:17:37 BUT OVER THE NEXT WEEK, YOU HAVE TO CHECK EVERY FASTENER

01:17:41 AROUND EVERY WINDOW ON EVERY PLANE. LISA KLINE TIGHTEN EVERY

01:17:45 FASTENER? TOM: HOW CAN YOU DO ANYTHING BUT

01:17:48 THAT? JONATHAN: YOU MENTIONED UNITED BUT THERE

01:17:54 ARE A LOT OF AIRLINES WAITING ON DELIVERIES FROM BOEING,

01:17:59 HOPING THAT THEY WOULD RAMP UP PRODUCTION.

01:18:00 IS THAT GOING TO HAPPEN AFTER THIS? TOM:

01:18:06 WOW. THAT IS ALL THAT CAN BE SAID.

01:18:09 JONATHAN: WE ALL CARE. WE ALL CARE, TOM, ABOUT WHAT

01:18:13 YOU THINK. ON THE TOP LINE SPENDING LEVEL

01:18:19 FOR THE CURRENT YEAR, THE CHANCES OF A PARTIAL GOVERNMENT

01:18:20 SHUTDOWN ATER THIS WEEK. -- LATER THIS WEEK.

01:18:31 AN ISSUE COULD STILL CAUSE AN IMPASSE.

01:18:33 I THINK IT WAS A POSITIVE SURPRISE.

01:18:39 AS MOST GUESTS HAVE TOLD US, DO NOT GET TOO CARRIED AWAY. LISA:

01:18:46 THE FREEDOM CAUCUS CALLED IT A DISASTER. THEY DO NOT LIKE IT.

01:18:50 REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO WORK THEMSELVES OUT.

01:18:54 HOW DO YOU GET SOMETHING PASSED? DO WE REALLY WORK THIS THROUGH

01:19:01 IN LESS THAN TWO WEEKS? TOM: THE ANSWER IS, IT IS GOING TO

01:19:04 COME BACK TO THE LINKAGE OF WORD FUNDING WITH THE MIGRANT

01:19:06 DEBATE AND THE BORDER. JONATHAN: LET'S TALK ABOUT ONE OF THOSE

01:19:12 FOREIGN WARS.

01:19:19 ANTHONY BLINKEN MORNING THAT IT COULD TURN INTO A MIDDLE EAST

01:19:21 CONFLICT. MAKING HIS REMARKS IN QATAR AND

01:19:25 OTHER STOPS IN THE REGION.

01:19:29 >> THIS IS A MOMENT OF PROFOUND TENSION IN THE REGION.

01:19:34 IT IS A CONFLICT THAT COULD EASILY METASTASIZE, CAUSING

01:19:35 EVEN MORE INSECURITY AND SUFFERING. JONATHAN:

01:19:37 HE IS SET TO TRAVEL TO SAUDI ARABIA, ISRAEL AND THE WEST

01:19:42 BANK. LISA: YOU WONDER WHAT THEIR

01:19:45 RELATIONSHIP IS WITH ISRAEL, AT A TIME WHERE ISRAEL IS

01:19:49 ATTACKING HEZBOLLAH MORE DIRECTLY.

01:19:53 AT A CERTAIN POINT, THE U.S.

01:19:59 CANNOT NOT GET INVOLVED BECAUSE SHIPS ARE GETTING REBOUNDED AND

01:20:01 YOU HAVE THESE DIRECT ATTACKS OF PERSONNEL AND BACK, AND

01:20:03 FOREIGN BASES. WHAT IS THE TIPPING POINT AT A

01:20:09 POINT WHEN THE GOVERNMENT IS MIRED IN THIS PRETTY

01:20:10 SIGNIFICANTLY? TOM: WHERE IS THE PUSHBACK?

01:20:15 WHERE ARE WE OFFENSIVELY GOING AFTER PEOPLE?

01:20:18 I DO NOT THINK THAT WE ARE. JONATHAN KLEIN GIVEN HOW

01:20:24 DELICATE THE MOMENT IS, THE STORY SOUNDS MORE AND MORE

01:20:29 BIZARRE. TOM: I AGREE THAT IT IS UNRAVELING.

01:20:34 WE ARE GOING TO UNRAVEL TO THE BOND MARKET.

01:20:39 THE CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST HERE. I LOVE WHERE YOU SAY THAT

01:20:44 EVERYTHING CONSIDERED, THERE IS A STRATEGIC BION BONDS FOR 2024.

01:20:51 WHAT FLAVOR OF BILLS, NOTES AND BONDS IS THE BEST STRATEGIC BY?

01:21:00 >> MOST INVESTMENT HORIZON IS LONG-TERM.

01:21:01 WHEN YOU ASKED WHETHER IT WILL BE AN ALPHA ENVIRONMENT -- IT

01:21:05 WILL BE BOTH. THAT IS WHAT WE SAW LAST YEAR

01:21:10 AND I THINK THAT IS WHAT WE WILL SEE THIS YEAR.

01:21:13 BY THE TIME YOU GOT TO THE END OF THE YEAR, IT WAS UP A

01:21:16 HANDFUL OF PERCENTAGE POINTS. THERE WAS A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY

01:21:20 IN BETWEEN.

01:21:26 THAT WAS THE LESSON. YOU HAVE TO BUCKLE UP AND KEEP

01:21:30 THE SEATBELT ON TIGHT AND SEE WHAT IS GOING ON OUT THERE.

01:21:36 INFLATION IS SLASHING DOWN. THINGS THAT PUSHED INFLATION UP

01:21:45 A SECOND TIME, RISING ENERGY PRICES -- PART OF THAT WAS A

01:21:46 WAR. WE ARE GOING INTO A THING THAT

01:21:52 DID NOT FEATURE IN THE FED MINUTE, NOT ONE TIME.

01:21:55 WE'RE ARE HEADING INTO THAT. YOU HAVE ENERGY PRICES GOING UP

01:22:02 AND TENSION IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THAT IS A FORMULA FOR SOMETHING

01:22:03 THAT COULD IN THE WAY.

01:22:09 I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE COULD GET INTO. TOM:

01:22:16 ARE YOU BRINGING DURATION IN?

01:22:21 >> WE WILL BE AT TIMES LONG AND SHORT. WE HAVE HAD A SPECTACULAR

01:22:23 RALLY.

01:22:29 THEY EXTENDED THE EXPECTATIONS AND RATE CUTS, WHICH WERE IN

01:22:32 ENTIRELY PLAUSIBLE SCENARIO, WHICH COULD COME TO PASS.

01:22:40 WE ARE SEEING SOME CONSOLIDATION AS INVESTORS

01:22:43 SECOND-GUESS WHETHER THEY WILL GET BE OF PERCENTAGE POINTS AND

01:22:45 RATE CUTS. WHAT WE SAW ON PAYROLL NUMBERS

01:22:53 IS DERIVATIVE OF THE TRAJECTORY. NOT ACCELERATING, NOT

01:22:58 DECELERATING -- GROWING. THE FED HAS A SINGLE VARIABLE

01:23:04 THAT WILL DRIVE THAT DECISION OF CUTTING RATES WERE NOT AT

01:23:06 THIS POINT. THAT IS INFLATION. DOES IT STAY DOWN?

01:23:13 IN THAT CASE, THEY CAN SLOWLY START CUTTING RATE.

01:23:18 OTHER CASES IT IS MORE COMPLICATED.

01:23:19 LOOKING AT BOTH GROWTH AND INFLATION. LISA:

01:23:25 ARE YOU LOOKING AT OIL PRICES TO DETERMINE WHETHER TO GO

01:23:26 ALONG OR SHORT?

01:23:30 >> I THINK VALUATIONS ARE THE CRITICAL THING.

01:23:32 AND THE RISK FACTOR. WHEN YOU GET CUTS PRICED IN

01:23:38 WHILE THE ECONOMY IS GROWING, BASED ON INFLATION BEING LOW,

01:23:42 INFLATION COULD BE VERY VOLATILE.

01:23:48 REALITY ON THE GROUND -- WE HAVE A SITUATION IN THE MIDDLE

01:23:49 EAST AND WE ARE GOING INTO WINTER WITH ENERGY PRICES

01:23:52 VOLATILE. IF IT CHANGES WHERE WE HAD A

01:24:00 LOW TARGET INFLATION MEETINGS, THAT WILL SLOW DOWN THE FED

01:24:07 BECAUSE THEIR MOTIF OF THE CYCLE IS NOT DO WHAT THEY DID

01:24:12 IN THE 1970'S, WHICH WAS ASSUME WHEN YOU ARE COMING DOWN THE

01:24:14 FIRST PEAK THAT THE WAR WAS OVER.

01:24:17 I THINK IT WILL BE A TACTICAL ENVIRONMENT.

01:24:21 I THINK WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RANGE RIGHT NOW BUT THE

01:24:24 POTENTIAL IS THERE IN BOTH DIRECTION. LISA:

01:24:29 WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE OVERHANG OF DEBT AND THE

01:24:35 PROPORTION OF THE BUDGET. HOW MUCH ARE YOU WATCHING?

01:24:43 >> THAT IS THE QUESTION PEOPLE ASKED AT THE END OF 2017.

01:24:49 PEOPLE BEGAN TO ASSUME THAT TRUMP WOULD NOT GET STIMULUS

01:24:55 PASSED. GROWTH WAS REBOUNDING.

01:24:58 WE HAD TWO STIMULUS PACKAGES PASSED AND A SURGE IN INTEREST

01:24:59 RATE.

01:25:06 SO SHE IS ALREADY MARKETING THESE EXTENSIONS OF TAX CUTS.

01:25:15 UNLESS THAT GETS STOMPED OUT EARLY ON, BUT I THINK THAT IS

01:25:18 ANOTHER WE'LL VARIABLE OUT THERE FOR THE MARGINS IN THIS

01:25:22 TRADING RANGE.

01:25:29 PUSHING RATES UP OR DOWN, MAKING IT A GREAT TRADING

01:25:31 MARKET. JONATHAN: YOU ARE PART OF THE MARKET.

01:25:37 IS THERE A POINT WHERE YOU THINK, I DO NOT WANT TO BUY

01:25:39 TREASURIES? HOW DOES THIS WORK?

01:25:48 >> I THINK THAT NUMBER ONE, AS TOM MENTIONED, THE FED IS DONE

01:25:54 RAISING RATES FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES, AS ARE THE OTHER

01:25:55 MAJOR CENTRAL BANKS. WE PUT OUT A QUARTERLY LAST

01:25:59 WEEK. WE ARE PAST THE PEAK AND INTEREST RATES.

01:26:06 INVESTORS, AS YOU CAN SEE, DO NOT WANT TO MISS OUT ON THIS

01:26:07 TIME.

01:26:07 ONCE YOU HAVE A BIG CYCLE, PEOPLE WANT TO WAIT FOR THE

01:26:13 NEXT ROUND OF IT. AS WE ROUNDED OUT THE END OF

01:26:18 SEPTEMBER INTO OCTOBER. I THINK THIS WILL BE A MARKET

01:26:23 WHERE YOU EARN THE YIELD AND YOU WANT TO TRADE THE RANGE ON

01:26:28 DURATION, ON SPREADS. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU

01:26:35 WENT TO THINK, THIS HAS BEEN A GREAT PERIOD IN THE BOND MARKET.

01:26:38 JONATHAN: ROBERT IS HERE FOR FIXED INCOME.

01:26:43 LISA, HOW WILL YOU LOOK AT THE BOND MARKET IN FIVE YEARS,

01:26:47 LOOKING FIVE YEARS BACK? LISA: THIS IS PART OF THE REASON WHY.

01:26:55 LOOK BACK AT HISTORY AND IN THE TO BE MONTHS BEFORE THE FED

01:27:01 STARTED CUTTING RATE IN EACH SUBSEQUENT CYCLE, EVERY SINGLE

01:27:04 TIME, WE SAW YIELDS COMING IN AND BONDS VALLEY. JONATHAN:

01:27:09 IF YOU ARE JUST JOINING US, WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM.

01:27:11 ONLY SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE HERE. AN UPDATE ON THE BOND MARKET.

01:27:16 YIELDS UP BY A SINGLE BASIS POINT.

01:27:21 I MENTIONED THIS NOTE A LITTLE EARLIER THIS MORNING.

01:27:32 ON THE BOILING FROND THAT MIGHT BE AN ISSUE IN WASHINGTON DC.

01:27:40 2030 IS NOT THAT FAR AWAY. TOM: THAT IS THE KEY POINT.

01:27:46 THE TIMELINE IS TANGIBLE.

01:27:56 A COMPARISON OF OUR GLIDE PATH.

01:28:09 JONATHAN: LOOK OUT FOR THAT CONVERSATION

01:28:12 ABOUT WHAT HE FIVE MINUTES FROM NOW.

01:28:18 KICKING OFF 2024 WITH A WEEK OF LOSSES. THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

01:28:42 >> TO BE SUSPECT THAT THERE IS AN OVERALL DESIGN PROBLEM WITH

01:28:48 DISPLAYING EAST ON PREVIOUS ACCIDENT INVOLVING THE BOEING

01:28:52 MAX? AT THIS POINT, NO.

01:28:55 WE ARE ONLY FOCUSED ON THIS INVESTIGATION, THIS AIRPLANE.

01:29:01 NOTHING IS OUT. JONATHAN:

01:29:08 THE LATEST FROM THE FAA, TEMPORARILY GROUNDING THE PLANE

01:29:12 AFTER A FUSELAGE SECTION BLEW OUT.

01:29:16 ALASKA AND UNITED AIRLINES ARE THE BIGGEST OPERATORS.

01:29:22 ALASKA AIR IS DOWN BY ALMOST 6%. STILL DOWN BY ALMOST 8%.

01:29:36 TOM: WE WILL SEE. I WONDER WHERE THE AIRLINE

01:29:42 BUSINESS IS HEADED FOR. THE SHOP IS THERE INTANGIBLE,

01:29:47 BUT THEY HAVE STRUGGLED TO REBOUND OFF OF COVID.

01:29:55 IT WILL BE FASCINATING. IT IS A GOOD PLACE TO START.

01:30:06 VERY GOOD, PARTICULARLY ON KANSAS MANUFACTURING.

01:30:11 SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST JOINS US.

01:30:13 WE ARE THRILLED THAT SHE COULD BE HERE WITH US TODAY.

01:30:20 THE OTHERS ARE LINED UP. WHAT IS THE URGENCY TO ACT, NOT

01:30:24 SO MUCH OFF THE BOWLING ACCIDENT BUT THE URGENCY TO ACT

01:30:29 BECAUSE OF THE TOPSY-TURVY MARKETS THEY ARE IN?

01:30:35 >> I THINK THAT WE HAVE THE SITUATION WHERE WE ARE

01:30:38 EXPECTING OR RESOLVE FOURTH-QUARTER TRAFFIC WAS

01:30:41 PRETTY GOOD. THE FURTHER WE GET AWAY FROM

01:30:44 2020, THE MORE PEOPLE SEE MANAGED CORPORATE TRAVEL COMING

01:30:47 BACK. I THINK THE TRIP WHERE YOU HAVE

01:30:51 MAY BE A ONE-DAY TRIP IS NOT COMING BACK ANY TIME SOON.

01:30:58 IT IS A LOT LIKE AFTER 9/11, WHERE THEY ARE SHORT WHOLE

01:31:00 TRIPS, ONE WAY. WE EXPECT THAT TO CONTINUE.

01:31:06 THE LONGER HAUL TRIPS, PEOPLE NEED TO GET OUT AND SEE THEIR

01:31:07 CLIENT.

01:31:16 WE ARE SEEING THAT INCREASE AND WE THINK THAT WILL CONTINUE FOR

01:31:17 THE REST OF THIS YEAR. TOM:

01:31:26 WITH THE RIVETS AND FASTENERS OF THAT ANALYSIS, WHAT DOES IT

01:31:29 MEAN FOR THE DYNAMIC? YOU KNOW IT IS GOING OUT AND

01:31:36 BUYING A BRIGHT AND SHINY NEW THING. IS THAT ACCELERATED?

01:31:42 >> YES AND NO.

01:31:43 AMERICA DID IT IN THE LAST DECADE, SO THEY ARE ON THE

01:31:50 DOWNSIDE OF THAT. UNITED IS DOING IT NOW.

01:31:55 DELTA IS IN THE MIDDLE OF IT.

01:32:03 THEY SPENT ABOUT 10% REVENUE ON CUTBACKS EVERY YEAR, SO THEY

01:32:08 ARE CONTINUALLY RECEDING. I DO NOT THINK ANYTHING CHANGES.

01:32:21 I KNOW IT MAKES UP 2% OF TOTAL TRANSPORTATION CARBON, BUT

01:32:31 OTHERS ARE DOING THE WHOLE THING FANTASTIC, SO AVIATION

01:32:33 OVER TIME IS A BIG PART OF IT.

01:32:40 LISA: I CANNOT GET OVER THIS. WORDS YOU DO NOT WANT TO HEAR.

01:32:46 IT IS NOT AS SAFE AS IT WAS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC, TALKING

01:32:50 ABOUT THE SAFETY OF FLYING AT A POINT WHEN WE HAD THIS IN WITH

01:32:55 ALASKA AIRLINES AND THE INCIDENT IN JAPAN.

01:32:58 QUESTIONS AROUND THE COMPETENCY AND STAFFING LEVELS OF SOME OF

01:33:02 THE AGENCIES. YOU CONCERNED? DO YOU FEEL IT IS NOT AS SAFE

01:33:07 TO FLY TODAY AS IT WAS PRE-PANDEMIC?

01:33:09 >> NO. THE FACT THAT THERE WERE NO

01:33:17 CASUALTIES ON THE JAPAN PLANE IS HUGELY SIGNIFICANT.

01:33:22 THEY WERE ABLE TO EVACUATE THE ENTIRE AIRCRAFT.

01:33:28 THERE WAS NO INCIDENT WITH HAVING THE EMERGENCY DOORS

01:33:33 BEING UNUSABLE BECAUSE OF A FIRE.

01:33:36 THAT IS ONE THING TO CONSIDER.

01:33:40 EVERY TIME THERE IS AN INCIDENT, THERE IS AN

01:33:41 INVESTIGATION. THERE IS NO COVER UP.

01:33:48 YOU DO NOT SEE THAT AS YOU WOULD OTHER INDUSTRIES.

01:33:54 THE REALLY HAVE NOT BEEN ANY MAJOR ACCIDENTS.

01:33:56 THE FACT THAT ALASKA AIR'S PILOTS WERE ABLE TO DECLARE AN

01:34:00 EMERGENCY TURN AROUND LAND SAFELY WITH NO INJURIES IS

01:34:02 HUGELY SIGNIFICANT.

01:34:16 AVIATION TRAINS FOR EVERY ACCIDENT.

01:34:20 I THINK AVIATION IS STILL VERY SAFE. LISA:

01:34:24 A LOT OF PEOPLE POINT AT WHAT HAPPENED IN JAPAN AND POINT AT

01:34:29 THE PLANE THAT EVERYBODY WAS ABLE TO GET OUT OF, WHICH I

01:34:34 THINK WAS AN AIRBUS. WHAT ABOUT SOME OF THE AIR

01:34:37 TRAFFIC CONTROL ISSUES? HOW IMPORTANT IS IT FOR

01:34:43 AIRLINES TO DO SOME SORT OF PR JOB, IF NOTHING ELSE TO ASSUAGE

01:34:45 THE CONCERNS OF NEUROTIC PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF.

01:34:52 >> I THINK YOU HAVE TO THINK THAT AVIATION IS SAFE, NUMBER

01:34:54 ONE. NUMBER TWO, WE DO NEED TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION.

01:35:05 THAT IS ANOTHER THING THAT WE DO FAVORABLY.

01:35:10 THE FAA IS CERTIFIED. THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO STEP UP

01:35:13 ITS EFFORTS. MY VIEWS ARE DIFFERENT.

01:35:20 I THINK THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE AND I THINK AIR

01:35:27 TRAFFIC CONTROL SHOULD BE A SEPARATE CORPORATION.

01:35:33 RIGHT NOW, GENERAL AVIATION DO NOT PAY FOR USING THE SYSTEM.

01:35:37 TOM: I WISH WE HAD ANOTHER HOUR TO

01:35:46 COVER THIS.

01:35:50 YEARS AGO, HOW DIFFERENT IS OUR TRANSPORTATION SAFETY STRUCTURE

01:35:51 VERSUS OTHER MAJOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES?

01:35:57 >> EUROCONTROL RUNS EUROPE. THAT IS A PUBLIC COMPANY.

01:36:03 CANADA HAS A COMPANY IN CANADA. IT IS JUST ONE DIFFERENTLY.

01:36:06 I'M NOT SAYING IT IS BETTER OR WORSE.

01:36:09 I'M JUST SAYING THAT IT IS DIFFERENT.

01:36:14 YOU DO NOT HAVE WHAT YOU HAVE HERE.

01:36:17 I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT NEXT GEN AND WE ARE STILL TALKING

01:36:18 ABOUT IT. IT IS YEARS OVER SCHEDULE AND

01:36:22 OVER BUDGET.

01:36:24 THEY FIRED ALL THE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND THEN WE TRAIN

01:36:36 THEM.

01:36:37 THEY ARE OVERWORKED, FATIGUED, WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH OF THEM

01:36:38 TO HANDLE WHAT WE ARE DOING RIGHT NOW.

01:36:49 WE WILL SEE GROWTH THROUGH REPLACING AIRCRAFT.

01:36:53 WE DO NOT THINK WE WILL SEE THE PILOT HIRING IN 2024 THAT WE

01:36:57 SAW IN 2021 THROUGH 2023. FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE, AS WE

01:37:02 MOVE FURTHER INTO THE DECADE, WE ARE NOT GOING TO GROW AS

01:37:08 FAST AS WE GROW IN PRIOR DECADES BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE

01:37:15 THE EXPERIENCE.

01:37:16 WE CANNOT PUSH THE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS INTO TOO MUCH

01:37:19 OVERTIME BECAUSE IT IS A TAXING JOB TO BEGIN WITH AND WE DO NOT

01:37:25 WANT ANY ACCIDENTS TO OCCUR IN THE U.S.

01:37:26 BECAUSE WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO

01:37:32 BE ABLE TO SAY THAT IT IS A SAFE FORM OF TRANSPORTATION.

01:37:47 THE DIFFERENCE -- UNITED WILL CONTINUE TO DO WELL BUT THEY

01:37:52 HAVE A $60 BILLION PROGRAM BETWEEN NOW AND 2032.

01:38:00 DELTA'S IS NOT AS BIG, SEE WILL NOT SEE THE STRESS AND THE

01:38:03 BALANCE SHEET THAT YOU MIGHT AT UNITED. JONATHAN:

01:38:07 THANK YOU VERY MUCH. TOM: UNITED 72% DEBT.

01:38:14 I DID NOT KNOW THAT. SHE IS GREAT.

01:38:22 EVERY TIME, IM -- I AM WOWED BY HER. JONATHAN: YOU CAN SEE THE

01:38:30 UNDERPERFORMANCE OF THE AIRLINE AROUND THIS JET THAT WE HAVE

01:38:31 BEEN DISCUSSING. LISA: THE OTHERS ARE EATING OUT GAINS.

01:38:37 JONATHAN: MORE TO COME ON THIS MARKET.

01:38:42 CPI DATA IS COMING ON THURSDAY.

01:39:00 >> WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHERE THE FED IS RIGHT NOW, THERE REALLY

01:39:02 IS NOT THAT CONSENSUS FOR A MARCH RATE CUT.

01:39:07 >> THE FED IS GOING TO CUT THIS YEAR.

01:39:09 WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT THOSE CUTS ARE LIKELY TO HAPPEN

01:39:10 AROUND MIDYEAR.

01:39:13 >> I DO THINK THE FED IS A LITTLE FRUSTRATED BY THE FACT

01:39:16 THE MARKET ALWAYS MUST BE MORE DOVISH THAN THE FED WANTS.

01:39:21 >> THE FED IS CLEARLY DONE AND HOW MUCH THEY WILL RAISE RATES.

01:39:25 >> THEY ARE A LONG WAY AWAY FROM THE RECONSIDERATION OF

01:39:26 RATE HIKES, BUT IT IS NOT TOTALLY OUT OF THE REALM OF

01:39:28 POSSIBILITY.

01:39:29 >> THIS IS "BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE"

01:39:29 WITH TOM KEENE, JONATHAN FERRO, AND LISA ABRAMOWICZ. TOM:

01:39:35 GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE. JONATHAN FERRO, LISA

01:39:37 ABRAMOWICZ, AND TOM KEENE. ON TO INFLATION.

01:39:42 A WORLD TURNED UPSIDE DOWN IN MOMENTS.

01:39:48 JAMES BIANCO WILL JOIN US.

01:39:54 A FLEET -- IF WE GET A BIANCO MARKET -- YIELD WILL GO HIGHER.

01:39:58 JONATHAN: LET'S START THIS MORNING WITH A

01:40:01 QUESTION FROM MIKE WILSON OF MORGAN STANLEY -- WHETHER THIS

01:40:06 RALLY WAS A YEAR AND SHORT SQUEEZE OR A SIGN THAT THE

01:40:09 MACRO FUNDAMENTALS WILL FINALLY IMPROVE IN A SUSTAINABLE MANNER.

01:40:14 THE DATA FRIDAY DID NOT SPEAK TO THAT RE-ACCELERATION. TOM:

01:40:22 I THOUGHT THE MIKE WILSON NOTE WAS EXCEPTIONALLY CUTE.

01:40:25 HE LAYS OUT THREE'S DIFFERENT SCENARIOS OUT THERE.

01:40:28 THERE WAS HUGE UNCERTAINTY WITHIN THE WILSON NOTE, SO I

01:40:30 HAVE TO GO BACK TO EARNINGS, AND THAT GOES BACK TO J.P.

01:40:32 MORGAN FRIDAY. JONATHAN: AND BANK OF AMERICA.

01:40:37 TRYING TO GET A FORWARD LOOK FROM THE RECENT DATA.

01:40:43 PAYROLLS GET ALL OF THE HEADLINES.

01:40:47 THE SERVICES SIM THAT CAME OUT 19 MINUTES LATER REALLY WHIPS

01:40:48 UP THIS MARKET. IF YOU LOOK UNDER THE SURFACE,

01:40:52 THE BIGGEST CONTRACTION SINCE 2020. PAYROLLS LOOK RIGHT AT THE

01:40:56 SURFACE. BENEATH THE SURFACE, SOME

01:40:57 CRACKS. YOU GO INTO THE ISM, AND CERTAIN ASPECT LOOK -- TOM:

01:41:11 WE ARE TALKING FANCY, ECONOMIC MACRO BABBLE, AND THE FACT IS

01:41:14 SOME OF THE STATISTICS SHOW AMERICA FLAT ON ITS BACK. LISA:

01:41:19 IT IS A COMPLICATED TOPIC. WE ARE IN A PANDEMIC ECONOMY,

01:41:23 POST-PANDEMIC ECONOMY. IT IS A COMPLICATED MOMENT,

01:41:26 WHICH IS THE REASON ROBERT TIPP WAS TALKING ABOUT A TRADING

01:41:30 RANGE. IT DOES NOT LEND ITSELF TO AN

01:41:33 OVERRIDING THESIS AS MUCH AS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE

01:41:34 BALANCE OF RISKS ARE. TOM: OR THE DATA DEPENDENCY.

01:41:41 THE BASIC IDEA TO ME IS THE ARC OF WHAT THE EARNINGS SEASON

01:41:45 WILL BRING, AND THERE IS SOME TANGIBLE ENTHUSIASM ABOUT

01:41:47 EARNINGS. THERE IS SOME LEGIT DUES HE HAS

01:41:51 HIM THAT THE GLOOM IS TOO GLOOMY. LISA:

01:41:55 SOME OF THE M&A CANNOT ROLLOVER AND THE IPO'S, IN PARTICULAR

01:41:58 FOR THE BANKING SECTOR. THIS WILL BE THE KEY POINT.

01:42:04 LORI CALVASINA OF RBC WAS TALKING ABOUT THIS EARLIER,

01:42:08 THAT ULTIMATELY, IT WILL ALL COME DOWN TO THE EARNINGS.

01:42:14 TOM: WE GOT SOME HEADLINES COMING

01:42:18 OUT. THESE ARE IMPORTANT.

01:42:20 THIS IS GEORGE FERGUSON AT BLOOMBERG INTELLIGENCE GIVING

01:42:22 US WISDOM ON SPIRIT. THEY WILL SHARE FURTHER

01:42:29 INFORMATION ON PROTOCOLS WITH REGULATORY AUTHORITIES.

01:42:32 SPIRIT AEROSYSTEMS IS FRONT AND CENTER IN THIS BURGEONING

01:42:34 INVESTIGATION. JONATHAN:

01:42:36 NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH SPIRIT AIRLINES.

01:42:40 THAT IS SPIRIT AEROSYSTEMS. BOEING IS DOWN SOMETHING LIKE

01:42:43 8% THIS MORNING. LISA: THIS COMES AFTER THEY HAD OTHER

01:42:49 ISSUES IN 2019, CRASSUS THAT DID ACTUALLY RESULT IN PEOPLE

01:42:51 GETTING INJURED. BUT PEOPLE FOCUSING ON THIS, TO

01:42:54 UNDERSTAND GOING FORWARD, WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR BOEING, WHAT

01:42:58 DOES IT MEAN FOR AIRLINES DEPENDING ON IT, INCLUDING

01:42:59 UNITED? TOM: IT IS OUR INTERVIEW OF THE DAY.

01:43:07 JIM BIANCO OF BEYONCA RESEARCH -- BIANCO RESEARCH THAT WE WILL

01:43:17 SEE SOME FORM OF LEVELING IN INFLATION AND, WITH THAT,

01:43:21 HIGHER INTEREST RATES. THE CALL IS EXTRAORDINARY, AND

01:43:25 NOW PEOPLE ARE REALLY BEGINNING TO PAY ATTENTION.

01:43:27 PUT A WHEN ON IT. WHAT IS THE TIMELINE YOU

01:43:32 PERCEIVE TO GET THE SHOCK OF HIGHER INTEREST RATES? JIM:

01:43:35 LET'S START WITH INFLATION. YOU COULD MAKE THE CASE THAT

01:43:39 THEY YEAR OVER YEAR INFLATION LEVEL BOTTOMED IN JUNE.

01:43:42 PROBABLY LATER THIS WEEK WHEN WE GET THE DECEMBER NUMBER, IT

01:43:48 WILL GO TO 2.2, 2.3.

01:43:55 THAT WOULD ESSENTIALLY BE IT. IF IT STARTS TRENDING HIGHER, I

01:44:01 THINK YOU START TO SEE INTEREST RATES RESPOND IN TIME, BECAUSE

01:44:04 WHAT THEY HAVE PRICED IN IS THIS IDEA WE ARE ON OUR WAY TO

01:44:08 2%, WE ARE JUST QUIBBLING ABOUT WHEN WE WILL GET THERE, NOT IF

01:44:09 WE ARE GOING TO GET THERE. IF WE ARE STARTING TO GO THE

01:44:14 OTHER WAY, I THINK YIELDS START GOING HIGHER.

01:44:18 IT DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THE FED HAS TO GO HIGHER, BUT

01:44:22 THE IDEA THE MARKET HAS SIX CUTS PRICED IN -- TOM:

01:44:28 WHEN THE AMBIGUITY OF HIGHER INTEREST RATES, DOES THAT COME

01:44:31 WITH BETTER GDP OR WORSE GDP? JIM:

01:44:36 I THINK IT COMES WITH BETTER GDP, AND I THINK THAT IS PART

01:44:37 OF THE ISSUE HERE. 2023 HAS NOT QUITE GOT IN THE

01:44:45 RECORD BOOKS YET, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE A 2.5% TO 3% YEAR IS THE

01:44:50 TREND GROWTH. IF YOU LOOK AT THE ATLANTA FED,

01:44:55 AND IT IS AS GOOD AS ANY OTHER MEASURE, ABOUT A 2.5%

01:44:58 FOURTH-QUARTER AFTER A 4.9% THIRD-QUARTER.

01:45:01 WE SLOWED FROM THE THIRD QUARTER TO THE FOURTH QUARTER

01:45:05 FROM WAY ABOVE TREND TO TREND OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE TREND, SO

01:45:07 THERE IS NO SOFT LANDING IN THIS ECONOMY RIGHT NOW.

01:45:10 THAT IS KIND OF WISHFUL THINKING.

01:45:14 THE EMPLOYMENT REPORT FRIDAY REALLY UNDERSCORED THAT.

01:45:17 IT IS NOT AN OUTRIGHT BOOM NOW BUT IT IS NOT A SOFT LANDING --

01:45:22 JONATHAN: LET'S GET INTO THE DATA ON

01:45:23 FRIDAY. IT LOOKS STRONG ON THE SURFACE,

01:45:28 BUT UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE, THIS FROM AND ALONG, MORE

01:45:35 PEOPLE TAKING A PART-TIME WORK FOR ECONOMIC REASONS, A DECLINE

01:45:36 IN WORKING HOURS. THE ISM WAS DREADFUL.

01:45:41 ARE WE NOT PUTTING ENOUGH WEIGHT ON THE DECEMBER DATA?

01:45:45 JIM: TWO THINGS. FIRST OF ALL, WE HAVE TO BE

01:45:48 CAREFUL WITH DECEMBER-JANUARY. A LOT OF SEASONAL FACT IS, AT

01:45:52 THE END OF THE YEAR THAT SKEW THOSE NUMBERS A LOT.

01:45:56 SECONDLY, WHAT WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT IS WHETHER OR NOT THE

01:45:58 NATURE OF WORK HAS CHANGED. I'VE BEEN HERE MANY TIMES

01:46:04 TALKING WE ARE IN A REMOTE WORK WORLD RIGHT NOW, WHERE PEOPLE

01:46:07 GO INTO THE OFFICE THREE OR FOUR DAYS A WEEK, NO LONGER FOR

01:46:10 FIVE DAYS A WEEK. THAT CHANGED A LOT ABOUT THE

01:46:15 OUTLOOK OF WORK AND REALLY WHAT WE MIGHT BE SEEING, LIKE WITH

01:46:18 THE INCREASE IN PART-TIME JOBS, IS THE NATURE OF WORK IS

01:46:22 CHANGING AS OPPOSED TO THAT IT IS A SIGN, NECESSARILY, OF

01:46:24 WEAKNESS. YOU DO NOT SEE IT IN OTHER

01:46:26 NUMBERS, LIKE THE INITIAL CLAIMS NUMBER.

01:46:32 THAT IS TYPICALLY A NUMBER ASSOCIATED WITH A VERY LONG --

01:46:35 VERY STRONG LABOR ECONOMY. LISA: SO YOU'RE SAYING YIELD COULD GO

01:46:42 UP, COULD GO DOWN COME YOU COULD END UP IN THIS TRADING

01:46:44 RANGE. HOW IMPORTANT IS CPI THURSDAY

01:46:50 TO INDICATE WHETHER THE -- THIS REALLY NOISY DATA OR WHETHER

01:46:53 THIS IS SHOWING WEAKNESS? JIM: IT IS IMPORTANT, BECAUSE THIS

01:47:00 MONTH, WE SHOULD HAVE A SMALL DRAG FROM GASOLINE PRICES.

01:47:04 IN NOVEMBER, THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS DROP IN GASOLINE

01:47:07 PRICES, WHICH IS WHY THE NUMBER WAS JUST 1/10.

01:47:08 BUT NOW THAT WE DO NOT HAVE QUITE THE DRAG IN GASOLINE

01:47:12 PRICES IN DECEMBER, WE CAN GET A TRUE IDEA OF WHAT THE

01:47:16 UNDERLYING TREND OF INFLATION IS WITHOUT THE NOISE OF GAS.

01:47:19 I THINK WHAT WE WILL FIND IS THAT UNDERLYING TREND MIGHT BE

01:47:24 CLOSE TO WHERE WE ARE OVER A YEAR-TO-YEAR BASIS, SOMEWHERE

01:47:25 AROUND 3%. WE ARE STILL IN 4% YEAR-OVER-YEAR ON CORE

01:47:29 INFLATION AS WELL. LISA: JON WAS MENTIONING THE BUDGET

01:47:36 DEFICIT, A LOOMING QUESTION OVER THE INFLATION DISCUSSION.

01:47:44 WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS REPORT, TALKING JPMORGAN, THAT

01:47:49 SHOWS MUCH -- MOST OF THE TAX REVENUES THE U.S.

01:47:50 BRINGS IN WILL GO TO ENTITLEMENT PAYMENTS.

01:47:53 THAT WAS BASED ON AN ASSUMPTION 10-YEAR TREASURY YIELD WOULD BE

01:47:59 AROUND 3.3% IN 2033. D THINK THAT KIND OF PROJECTION

01:48:05 IS REALISTIC, OR ARE WE LOOKING AT A 4% WORLD FOR THE

01:48:06 FORESEEABLE FUTURE? JIM: I THINK WE ARE LOOKING AT

01:48:09 HIGHER RATES. WE ARE IN A TRENDINGLY HIGHER

01:48:14 ENVIRONMENT FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS.

01:48:20 WE COULD HAVE A SLOWDOWN IN THE ECONOMY AND A TWO OR THREE YEAR

01:48:22 RALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF IT, BUT WE GOT TO START THINKING ABOUT

01:48:24 INTEREST RATES TRENDING NORTH AS OPPOSED TO TRENDING SOUTH.

01:48:28 THAT ENDED WITH THE PANDEMIC A COUPLE YEARS AGO.

01:48:33 AS IT DOES, WE WILL SEE ESPECIALLY INTEREST COSTS

01:48:36 BECOME A WEAKER PROBLEM. THEY JUST WENT OVER $1 TRILLION

01:48:41 ON A YEARLY BASIS THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE PAYING FOR,

01:48:43 WHICH IS MORE THAN THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT.

01:48:47 THAT IS NOT GOING TO GET ANY BETTER BECAUSE MORE DEBT WILL

01:48:50 BE ROLLING OFF AT LOWER COUPONS AND WILL BE REISSUED AT HIGHER

01:48:51 COUPONS. JONATHAN: WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS

01:48:55 FOR THE BETTER PART OF A DECADE. THE DAY OF RECKONING, JUST HOW

01:49:00 FAR AWAY IS IT? SURELY YOU CANNOT REMAIN ON

01:49:03 THIS TRAJECTORY. WHAT IS THAT THEY RECKONING

01:49:05 LOOK LIKE? JIM: IT LOOKS A LOT LIKE WHAT YOU

01:49:10 SAW IN 2022 IN THE U.K.

01:49:16 WITH THE GILT MARKET AND THE LIABILITY INVESTMENT PROBLEM.

01:49:19 WHEN THE MARKET DECIDES THE DAY OF RECKONING IS HERE, WHEN THE

01:49:22 U.K. PUT OUT A BUDGET THE MARKET DID

01:49:24 NOT LIKE, IT FORCED IT TO CHANGE.

01:49:27 THE MARKETS WILL DO THAT, TOO. IF WE ARE GOING TO KEEP

01:49:31 BORROWING DEBT AND WE WILL KEEP SPENDING AND WILL KEEP RUNNING

01:49:34 UP INTEREST COSTS, AT SOME POINT, IT IS NOT GOING TO BE A

01:49:35 COMMISSION BY THE GOVERNMENT THAT WILL FIX IT OR A CHANGE IN

01:49:39 THE LEADERSHIP IN THE WHITE HOUSE, IT IS GOING TO BE THE

01:49:42 MARKET THAT WILL PUT ITS FOOT DOWN AND SAY, ENOUGH, THIS WILL

01:49:46 STOP NOW, LIKE IT DID IN THE U.K. IN SEPTEMBER OF 2022.

01:49:49 WHETHER THAT IS NEXT MONTH OR 10 YEARS FROM NOW, THAT WE CAN

01:49:53 DEBATE, BUT IT WILL BE THE MARKET THAT MAKES THAT CHANGE.

01:49:55 JONATHAN: THE U.K. DID NOT HAVE THE LUXURY OF

01:49:58 ACTING RECKLESSLY. DO YOU THINK THE U.S.

01:50:01 DOES, TO ANY EXTENT? JIM: IT HAS BECAUSE IT IS THE

01:50:05 RESERVE CURRENCY. AS LONG AS IT IS, IT IS

01:50:11 AFFORDED THE LATITUDE NO OTHER COUNTRY IS, BECAUSE EVERYONE

01:50:14 ELSE HAS TO OWN OUR DEBT OR OWN OUR CURRENCY, BECAUSE THAT IS

01:50:17 WHAT TRADE IS DONE IN, AND THAT IS THE DOMINANT CURRENCY THAT

01:50:18 RUNS THE WORLD ECONOMY. WHAT IF HE WERE TO LOSE THAT

01:50:24 STATUS -- TO BE CLEAR, I DO NOT THINK WE ARE ABOUT TO LOSE THAT

01:50:27 STATUS ANYTIME SOON, BECAUSE THERE IS A LACK OF AN L

01:50:33 TENTATIVE -- THAT ULTIMATELY -- BECAUSE THERE IS A LACK OF AN

01:50:37 ALTERNATIVE. JONATHAN: HUGE NUMBERS.

01:50:42 JIM BIANCO OF YUNKER RESEARCH -- BIANCO RESEARCH ON THE

01:50:48 POTENTIAL OF INTEREST RATES HIGHER.

01:50:56 4.057% -- HOW CLOSE IS THAT DAY OF RECKONING? TOM:

01:51:01 THAT IS THE WHOLE THING, THE X AXIS.

01:51:05 BIANCO HAS BEEN WAY AHEAD OF IT. THE CONTINUED CALL FOR HIGHER

01:51:10 YIELDS REALLY PUSHES AGAINST THE DISINFLATION STORY.

01:51:12 WHAT IS SO IMPORTANT, AND I ASKED BECAUSE IT IS A JOHN

01:51:18 RIDING QUESTION, YOU GET HIGHER RATES, THAT IS TERRIBLE, WE

01:51:24 WILL ALL DIE -- BUT BIANCO WAS CLEAR, MAYBE THAT IS A SIGN OF

01:51:27 A MORE RESILIENT U.S. GDP. LISA: IT IS HOW THEY GO UP.

01:51:32 IF THEY GO UP JUST A TOUCH BECAUSE HOW STRONG THE ECONOMY

01:51:35 IS, THAT IS OK, BUT IF THE MARKET PUTS ITS FOOT DOWN, AS

01:51:41 JIM BIANCO WAS SAYING, IT BRINGS TO MIND WHAT JAMES

01:51:42 CARVILLE SAID. WHEN HE GETS REINCARNATED WHEN

01:51:47 HE DIES, HE DOES NOT WANT TO COME BACK AS A PERFECT BASEBALL

01:51:50 HATER, HE WANTS TO COME BACK AS A BOND MARKET.

01:51:52 YOU CAN INTIMIDATE EVERYONE. THAT IS WHY EVERYONE IS

01:51:54 WATCHING. JONATHAN: IT WAS INTIMIDATING FOR ABOUT

01:52:00 FIVE MINUTES LAST YEAR. THE MONTH OF OCTOBER.

01:52:04 SLIGHTLY INTIMIDATING CARE THEN BACKED AWAY FOR A COUPLE MONTHS.

01:52:08 OVERALL, THE TREASURY MARKET BULLIED EVERYONE, INCLUDING THE

01:52:12 BANKS. TOM: I REMEMBER A POINT WHERE I WAS

01:52:15 STATING THIS WAS THE TECHNICAL CONSTRUCTION OF THE MARKET IN

01:52:19 OCTOBER, AND IT WAS GRIM, GRIM, GRIM.

01:52:23 A WEEK LATER, IF I HAD MONEY IN PLAY, I WOULD BE SHELLACKED.

01:52:25 LISA: PART OF IT WAS THE TREASURY

01:52:28 MARKET RESPONDING TO THE BOND MARKET. JONATHAN:

01:52:33 IF YOU HAVE MONEY IN PLAY, YOU WOULD BE SHELLACKED. LISA:

01:52:36 THEORETICALLY. JONATHAN:

01:52:42 YOUR EQUITY MARKET IS TOTALLY UNCHANGED ON THE S&P 500.

01:52:43 FROM NEW YORK CITY, GOOD MORNING. ♪

01:53:03 >> WE HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATING IN GOOD FAITH ALL THROUGH THE

01:53:08 HOLIDAYS ON THE TOP LINE NUMBERS.

01:53:09 CONGRESS HAS A RESPONSIBILITY. WE HAVE THE POWER OF THE PURSE,

01:53:13 AND WE HAVE TO BE GOOD STEWARDS OF PRECIOUS TAXPAYER RESOURCES.

01:53:16 WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO BORROW MONEY TO SPEND IT.

01:53:21 REDUCING NON-DOES -- NON-DEFENSE DISCRETIONARY

01:53:23 SPENDING HAS TO BE A PRIORITY OF CONGRESS. JONATHAN:

01:53:27 THAT WAS SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON BEFORE AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF AN

01:53:32 AGREEMENT IN CONGRESS, EASING CONCERNS OF A LOOMING

01:53:35 GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. YOUR EQUITY MARKET MORE BROADLY

01:53:38 THIS MORNING IS TOTALLY UNCHANGED ON THE S&P 500.

01:53:44 YIELDS ARE GOING NOWHERE, UP BY ALMOST ONE BASIS POINT.

01:53:49 A REAL TUG-OF-WAR ON THE FRONT END OF THE YIELD CURVE FRIDAY.

01:53:51 WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THAT ALREADY.

01:53:55 PAGE RULES -- PAYROLLS GROWTH LOOKS SOLID, THE REST OF IT,

01:53:56 NOT SO MUCH. THE TWO THE TOTALLY UNCHANGED

01:54:04 BY THE END -- THE TWO YEAR WAS TOTALLY UNCHANGED BY THE END OF

01:54:05 TRADING. TOM: TAKE US BACK. THIS WAS 8:30 IN THE MORNING.

01:54:12 WE LOOK AT THE REVISIONS. AND ALONG LOOKS LIKE A GENIUS.

01:54:17 THEN ISM COMES OUT, WHAT, 90 MINUTES LATER, AND IT'S "OOPS."

01:54:21 JONATHAN: YOU HAVE ALL THE SUB INDEXES.

01:54:25 CLOSE TO STAGNATING IN DECEMBER. THAT IS THE OVERALL READ.

01:54:31 THE BIGGEST DROP GOING BACK TO MARCH, SO THE CHANGE WAS

01:54:33 NEGATIVE. EMPLOYMENT, BIGGEST CONTRACTION

01:54:34 SINCE 2020. THE GAUGE OF EMPLOYMENT IN THE

01:54:37 LOW 40'S. MANUFACTURING EARLIER IN THE

01:54:43 WEEK HAS BEEN IN CONTRACTION SINCE LATE 2022.

01:54:45 PUT IT ALL TOGETHER, NOT GREAT. BUT AGAIN, WE ALL CAUTIONED THE

01:54:48 SAME THING. THE QUIRKS OF DECEMBER. TOM:

01:54:53 THIS IS NOT MICHIGAN CONFIDENCE. THIS IS COUNTABLE DATA.

01:54:57 IS IT LIKE WEEKLY CLAIMS? NO.

01:55:04 I AM GOING TO SUGGEST ISM IS A SOMEWHAT COUNTABLE IDEA.

01:55:08 JONATHAN: IT GOES COMPLETELY AGAINST THE

01:55:13 GRAIN, THE HEADLINE NUMBERS IN PAYROLLS FRIDAY, WHICH SAID

01:55:14 EVERYTHING IS OK. THAT SAID SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

01:55:17 TOM: THE EURO UNCHANGED. JONATHAN:

01:55:23 THAT WILL DESTROY THE MORNING, WITHOUT A DOUBT. TOM:

01:55:30 WHAT IS IN YOUR MORNING, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.

01:55:34 WE ARE DELIGHTED TO HAVE HENRIETTA TREYZ IN STUDIO.

01:55:39 WE HAD THIS PEEK OF THE HOUSE VERBATIM OF REPUBLICAN CANT C

01:55:45 ANON OVER DECADES AND DECADES AND DECADES.

01:55:48 I WANT YOU TO DESCRIBE THE DISSENSION OF THE GOP HOPE TO

01:55:52 CUT SPENDING NOMINALLY OR CUT SPENDING ON AN

01:55:54 INFLATION-ADJUSTED REAL BASIS. TO ME, THE DISTINCTION IS IN

01:55:57 PARAMOUNT. HENRIETTA: I THINK WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT,

01:56:03 THE DISSENSIONS AND THE NUMBERS BETWEEN THE HOUSE FREEDOM

01:56:05 CAUCUS, THE SPEAKER, AND THE NEW DEAL THEY JUST REACHED OVER

01:56:08 THE WEEKEND, AND WHAT SENATE APPROPRIATORS HAVE DONE IS SO

01:56:12 THE MINIMUS, THAT TO CALL THIS MATERIAL DEFICIT REDUCTION IS

01:56:16 KIND OF LAUGHABLE TO ANYONE WHO IS LIKE JIM BIANCO LOOKING FOR

01:56:19 ERNEST DEFICIT REDUCTION. THAT IS NOT WHAT WE ARE TALKING

01:56:21 ABOUT HERE. WE WILL GET A DEAL THAT

01:56:25 BASICALLY HAS FLATLINED FUNDING. IF YOU ADD ON ADDITIONAL AID

01:56:30 UKRAINE, ISRAEL, ETC., DOMESTIC SUPPLEMENTALS, THAT IS $59

01:56:38 BILLION THE WHITE HOUSE REQUESTED, YOU'RE LOOKING AT

01:56:39 FISCAL SPENDING HIGHER. TOM:

01:56:45 I REMEMBER BEING -- WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR

01:56:47 DECADES. THE DISTINCTION IS THE CUTTING

01:56:51 OF NOMINAL OR REAL SPENDING. THE BRITISH HAD AN EXPERIENCE

01:56:58 OF REAL SPENDING CUTS OVER A ZILLION YEARS AGO.

01:56:59 ARE WE REALLY GOING TO DO THAT? HENRIETTA:

01:57:02 THERE IS NO SCENARIO WE DO REAL CUTS.

01:57:07 THE BEST CHANCE IS IF, IN 2025, YOU HAVE A SPLIT HOUSE AND

01:57:10 HOUSE AND SENATE. THE ONLY SCENARIO I SEE THAT

01:57:15 HAPPENING IS IF BIDEN'S PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICANS WHEN

01:57:17 THE HOUSE OR SENATE, AND YOU HAVE A MASSIVE TAX BILL DUE,

01:57:21 AND YOU HAVE A SCENARIO WHERE REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ARE

01:57:27 NEGOTIATING $2 TRILLION IN TAX CHANGES, ENTITLEMENT

01:57:30 DISCUSSION, SORT OF THE DEFICIT COMMISSION, THE SUPERCOMMITTEE,

01:57:33 THAT KIND OF STUFF ALL OVER AGAIN IN 2025.

01:57:36 BUT YOU NEED TO SPLIT CONGRESS, AND NOT THIS YEAR. LISA:

01:57:41 WHAT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER THIS SPENDING DEAL IS

01:57:44 MAKING ANY PROGRESS RATHER THAN A NICE SHOW OF PROGRESS THAT

01:57:45 GETS COMPLETELY DASHED? HENRIETTA:

01:57:50 THIS TIME AROUND, REPUBLICANS ARE HAVING AN EVEN SMALLER

01:57:51 MAJORITY. MATH REMAINS UNDEFEATED. . .

01:57:55 WE ARE TRYING TO COUNT VOTES YOU CANNOT GET THERE FOR

01:58:00 ANYTHING OTHER THAN A DEMOCRAT PLUS PUBLICAN PACKAGE, WHICH

01:58:03 MEANS YOU WILL LOSE THE FAR RIGHT.

01:58:06 IT IS UP TO SPEAKER JOHNSON DOES -- TO DECIDE WHETHER TO

01:58:07 BARREL AHEAD. YOU WILL GET STOPGAP CR'S TO

01:58:13 FUND THE GOVERNMENT FROM JANUARY 19 TO FEBRUARY 2, THEN

01:58:16 WE ARE DOING THAT INTO MARCH AND AGAIN IN APRIL.

01:58:20 THE REALITY IS WE DO NOT HAVE A DEADLINE UNTIL MAY 1, SO THEY

01:58:22 DO NOT ACTUALLY HAVE TO ACT UNTIL THEN, AND I SUSPECT WE

01:58:25 WILL GET A NUMBER OF CR'S DESPITE THE TOP LINE DEAL. LISA:

01:58:29 THIS IS A MASSIVELY, BECAUSE WE ALSO HAVE THE IOWA RACE HEATING

01:58:32 UP HEADING INTO NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND THERE IS A REAL FOCUS ON

01:58:35 2024 AND THE ELECTION RACE. DO YOU THINK THE LLOYD AUSTIN

01:58:41 SITTING, WHERE OUR SECRETARY OF DEFENSE WENT IS ENDURING A

01:58:45 SERIOUS PERIOD OF TIME INTERNATIONALLY IS GOING TO

01:58:46 MAKE IT INTO SOME OF THE DISCUSSION AROUND REELECTION

01:58:50 AND PLATFORMS AND WHAT IS GOING ON AT SOME OF THE TOP LEVELS?

01:58:53 HENRIETTA: IT WOULD BE POLITICAL MALPRACTICE FOR ANY OF THE

01:58:59 REPUBLICANS NOT TO MENTION IT ALL DAY.

01:59:02 I IMAGINE TRUMP IS EXCITED TO BE THE FRONT RUNNER -- THAT IS

01:59:04 MY FORECAST FOR SURE. HE WILL BRING IT UP FOR THE

01:59:07 REMAINDER OF THE YEAR. JONATHAN: CAN YOU HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT

01:59:12 TYPICALLY HAPPENS WHEN THERE IS A TERRORIST ATTACK LIKE THE ONE

01:59:16 THAT TOOK PLACE IN IRAN LAST WEDNESDAY.

01:59:17 DOES THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL REACH OUT TO THE

01:59:18 PENTAGON? WHERE I AM STRUGGLING WITH THIS

01:59:24 STORY IS THEY DID NOT FIND OUT THE DEFENSE SECRETARY WAS

01:59:28 MISSING UNTIL THURSDAY, WHEN THESE BIG THINGS WERE HAPPENING.

01:59:30 IT GIVES ME THE IMPRESSION, AND I AM LOOKING FOR CORRECTION IF

01:59:33 YOU HAVE GOT IT, IT GIVES THE IMPRESSION THEY DO NOT TALK TO

01:59:37 EACH OTHER EITHER WHEN BAD THINGS HAPPEN.

01:59:40 IS THERE A CORRECTION THERE? HENRIETTA:

01:59:41 NOT ONLY ARE YOU NOT TALKING, HOW ARE YOU TELEGRAPHING YOUR

01:59:42 NOT SPEAKING? HOW ARE YOU NOT GETTING UPDATED

01:59:46 OR NOT PROVIDING A PRESS? RELEASE THAT CURES WHERE THEY

01:59:50 ALL ARE? APPARENTLY THEY HAVE THEM ALL

01:59:53 TRACKED AND KNOW THEM -- KNOW PRECISELY WHERE THEY ARE AT

01:59:54 THAT SENIOR-LEVEL. JONATHAN: IT IS QUITE WORRYING, ISN'T IT?

02:00:00 IT IS NOT JUST A LAPSE IN COMMUNICATION, IT MAKES YOU

02:00:01 THINK THEY ARE NOT TALKING TO EACH OTHER. HENRIETTA:

02:00:07 IT IS UNFATHOMABLE THAT THEY ARE NOT TALKING, SO THERE NEEDS

02:00:11 TO BE SERIOUS CLEANUP IN AISLE 2. THE WHITE HOUSE NEEDS TO STEP

02:00:15 UP THE EDUCATION IN THIS ONE. JONATHAN:

02:00:17 I AM REALLY STRUGGLING WITH THIS STORY OVER THE WEEKEND.

02:00:19 TOM: I THINK IT IS INDICATIVE OF THE

02:00:21 ADMINISTRATION. I THINK THEY GOT A LOT, LOT TO

02:00:26 TALK ABOUT. IT IS NOT GOING AWAY. JONATHAN:

02:00:29 YOU THINK THERE IS JUST TOO MUCH ON THEIR PLATE?

02:00:31 DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT? HENRIETTA:

02:00:34 I THINK IT IS AN INDICATOR OF THE CAVALIER ATTITUDE THEY GO

02:00:40 -- HAVE GOING INTO 2025 AND THE ELECTION CYCLE.

02:00:42 IF I WERE TO EXTRAPOLATE, WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THEIR

02:00:46 ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND VOTERS?

02:00:53 IF 70% OF AMERICANS THINK THAT WE ARE IN RECESSION,

02:00:55 STAGNATION, OR DEFLATION. THEIR MESSAGING TEAM AND PRESTI

02:00:59 NEEDS TO HEAR THAT. LISA: WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR IN THE

02:01:04 IOWA CAUCUS TO UNDERSTAND HOW REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO SHIFT

02:01:08 THIS FORWARD AND WHO NUMBER TWO WILL BE BEHIND THE ASSUMED

02:01:12 HEAD, WHICH IS DONALD TRUMP? HENRIETTA:

02:01:14 I WOULD LOVE THE PRIMARY SEASON TO BE A REAL BELLWETHER, BUT I

02:01:17 THINK ANY OF THE CANDIDATES NOT NAMED TRUMP WILL HAVE TO WAIT

02:01:19 UNTIL THE CONVENTION. I DO NOT SEE AN OPPORTUNITY,

02:01:25 ASIDE FROM S
