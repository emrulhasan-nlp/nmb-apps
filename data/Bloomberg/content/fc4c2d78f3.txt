00:03 Good morning. We're half an hour away from the opening

00:05 bell. Hong Kong, Shanghai and shenzhen.

00:08 Welcome. You're watching the china shum David

00:10 Ingles. Our top stories this morning.

00:12 A tsunami warning is issued after a magnitude 7.4 earthquake shakes.

00:16 Taiwan chip maker tsmc evacuating some staff from production lines.

00:21 President biden and president xi speaking for the first time since

00:24 november. The white house saying the tick tock

00:26 sale push was on the agenda and asian stocks and treasurys under pressure

00:31 after solid U.S. eco data spurs bets that major central

00:35 banks will keep rates higher for longer.

00:56 Breaking news this morning. Strong series of earthquakes hitting

01:01 Taiwan and also being felt across some parts of Japan and also the Chinese

01:06 mainland Taiwan. Markets are just coming on line.

01:08 We're down about 7/10 of 1%. This is based on one official, the

01:13 strongest earthquake to have hit Taiwan in 25 years.

01:18 We're still looking at initial market reaction.

01:20 But certainly when this hit, of course, if on about, I would say about an hour

01:23 back. The series of headlines coming through

01:27 did indicate that this was on the stronger side of things.

01:30 Yeah, and I was I've been speaking to family over there in Taipei and they

01:33 felt that first thing this morning. And the aftershocks are still feeling at

01:37 this point here right now. You mentioned about the strongest quake

01:41 we've seen in 25 years. That brings us back to the so-called 9

01:44 to 1 earthquake on the island which killed more than 2000 people.

01:49 This is video from my mother in law. I want to show you just of what we just

01:52 saw the last few minutes or so. And we've seen we've seen pictures of

01:56 even the subway system, the ground where it's shaking outside.

02:00 Certainly we're focusing on the damage, of course, to buildings so far this

02:04 year. Now, this so far today, and also just

02:07 the number of casualties. But we haven't had those details just

02:10 yet. So for the nuclear power plant,

02:11 operations remain normal. That's according to Thai power and the

02:14 power distribution system has stabilized it says TSMC.

02:19 A spokesperson, spokeswomen from the firm here, Nina Karl, in a text message

02:24 about half an hour back talking about how well TSMC has.

02:27 We evacuated some staff from production lines at number one.

02:31 And number two, Kyodo News is reporting that nearby Okinawa, which is nearby, of

02:36 course, where Taiwan is, the airport in Naha, has halted arrivals and also

02:42 departures. More headlines coming through here,

02:46 another aftershock coming through five and a half magnitude quake two

02:49 kilometers south southwest of quality in the city, which I believe.

02:52 Yvonne, we were looking at some of the videos early on of some buildings gone.

02:56 Yes, there's been some fixtures that have collapsed in some ways.

03:00 There has been some pictures have been circling around social media here right

03:03 now. But we'll bring it to you once we do see

03:05 more. But certainly we are hearing about

03:07 tsunami waves Reaching 1 to 3 meters are possible along not just Taiwan's coast,

03:12 but also in China. That's according to the Pacific Tsunami

03:15 Warning Center. And we talked about TSMC.

03:18 So certainly we're watching the impact it has not just on the city and the

03:21 island itself, but also what it means for stocks as well as the currency here

03:25 today. Yeah, we did see an initial bid come

03:28 across the Japanese currency when headlines started dropping as well.

03:31 More details in case you missed it, Just to recap, about an hour back, 758 local

03:36 time in Taiwan, a 7.4 magnitude quake, that's according to the USGS, hits 18

03:44 kilometers from Holyhead City. That's in the island's east.

03:47 It was 7.2 on certain scales in other certain in certain countries as well.

03:53 We showed you market reaction as well in a moment.

03:55 Of course, in case you missed it, we did show you a map there of Taiwan where

03:59 that the sort of center of gravity was. And of course, along the west coast of

04:03 Taiwan is, of course, just sprinkled and that series of key factories.

04:09 We'll talk more about supply chain disruptions or potential for supply

04:13 chain disruptions in a moment. Yeah, Let's go to Adrian Kennedy.

04:16 He's our senior editor for the news Desk.

04:17 So joining us from Taipei here this morning.

04:20 Adrian, first and foremost, I hope you're okay.

04:22 Just bring us up to speed. What's happening in the latest.

04:26 Okay. Good morning.

04:27 So in about 2 minutes, 2 a.m. this morning, we were struck in Taipei

04:31 by a fairly strong temblors, the strongest I've had in my ten years in

04:35 Taiwan. And we've just been informed by the

04:38 government that it was the strongest quake to hit the island since at least

04:42 19, since 1999. That was an earthquake which killed more

04:46 than 2000 people. Now in Taiwan, I'm working from the

04:50 middle of Taipei. I can't see any visible signs of damage,

04:53 but the actual initial temblor was fairly long.

04:57 It went from the, I guess, 20 to 30 seconds.

05:00 And we've had several aftershock shocks. And since we understand that there have

05:05 been some evacuations from some facilities, particularly closer to

05:11 the more to the epicenter of the earthquake, which was in Hualien on the

05:15 east of the island, there was a tsunami warning issued related to some parts of

05:20 the east and Okinawa. My understanding is that the tsunami

05:25 waves were not forecast to be particularly large.

05:28 And I do understand that Okinawa has not been severely affected, but that is

05:34 unconfirmed and we're still getting information.

05:36 So this happened a little over an hour ago.

05:40 Yeah. Adrian Maybe just to build on that as

05:43 well. We did just get a headline coming

05:45 through out of Kyodo News on Okinawa itself that the airport, the NAHA

05:48 Airport, has halted arrivals and departures, at least to some extent,

05:53 affected to that extent. Adrian, I'm wondering if you could talk

05:56 a little bit more about any potential or current disruptions to any production

06:00 supply chains. We did hear, of course, from a TSMC

06:03 spokesperson about 30 minutes back. One, if you could give us some context

06:06 and what we have heard so far along those lines.

06:09 Sure. So Taiwan is semiconductor manufacturing

06:14 hub, as you know, making some of the world's most advanced chips.

06:19 We do understand some of the facilities have evacuated personnel.

06:23 But I would also underscore that these are very sophisticated factories.

06:28 Taiwan is habituated to earthquakes.

06:31 We often get temblors, and these are facilities which are built to withstand

06:37 severe impacts. They have their own water supplies.

06:40 They often have their own power generation.

06:43 And Taiwan as an island, as a government, as a community.

06:48 It's really designed to deal with catastrophes, whether they're from from

06:55 earthquakes or severe typhoons. So our understanding is that, you know,

07:00 there could be there could be some action by the factories, but there's no

07:06 indication right now that there will necessarily be any disruption to supply

07:10 lines on the east coast of the island, which is far less populated and also is

07:19 less of a production center for anything.

07:21 That's really where the majority of industry is on is on the West.

07:25 It's likely that disruptions and damages and hopefully fatality, probably

07:31 fatalities will be will be minimal or nil, but it's likely the damage will be

07:36 much more severe on that side. We don't have confirmed a report or I

07:41 haven't seen confirmed reports of what's exactly going on over there.

07:44 But there are concerns that there may have been building collapses.

07:50 Adrian, thank you so much. Adrian Kennedy in Taipei for us.

07:53 As Adrian is pointing out, left side of your screens is Taiwan, where the

07:56 earthquake hit on the eastern part, less populated still under her left side.

08:00 We've actually have a setting this on a terminal which actually outlines and

08:03 indicates specifically where the factories are, who's running those

08:06 factories and what type of factories are actually churning out markets on the

08:10 right side, 4/10 of 1%. For more on this, you can turn to your

08:12 Bloomberg TV. Go to get commentary analysis from our

08:16 expert editors here as well. Now, looking broadly here, what across

08:20 markets, as we shift gears and talk a little more, what's going on as a

08:23 countdown, of course, of the China Open here this morning.

08:25 And certainly we're seeing what's been going on.

08:28 The Treasury market is really starting to impact stocks.

08:30 Yeah. Finally, in some ways.

08:32 Right. And you're starting to see stocks are in

08:34 the back foot here. U.S.

08:35 futures are also slightly to the downside and the dollar continues to

08:38 peak higher here. In fact, we're reaching those 2024 highs

08:42 for multiple of the, you know, dollar gauges.

08:45 Also, when it comes to the U.S. ten year yield and parts of the longer

08:48 end of the Treasury curve. So you're watching very closely the sell

08:51 off when it comes to fixed income, the Golden Dragon index, and do too much

08:55 overnight. But certainly we're very much watching

08:58 what goes on when it comes to the eight share market, where we did see a 20%

09:02 rally from the January lows. Now, obviously, we're not calling it a

09:06 bull market in some ways because we're still going to track a little bit more.

09:09 But the state buying that's involved and what really is driving this rally and

09:13 the other day, and we're also going through a lot of earnings to tell you

09:16 about as well. Futures are slightly to the downside

09:18 here this morning. 229 for the Chinese ten year yield and

09:21 we're still talking about the offshore rate at 725 against the dollar.

09:25 The onshore rate is at the highest we've seen or the lowest we've seen since

09:29 November. Right now, there was some talk from

09:31 traders that they actually blocked some of these swap trades as the U.S.

09:35 extends that loss, which maybe is an indication that maybe even the onshore

09:39 rate is trading very weak and very close to that trading ban.

09:42 We had a 2% upper upper end of the trading ban.

09:45 And of course, the offshore rate, as everyone is pointing out, is already

09:48 trading beyond that level as well. Do keep in mind that China is shut from

09:52 tomorrow. So the holidays might also have

09:55 been causing some aberrations into swaps market as well.

09:58 All that being said, it's a strong dollar story that takes us to our other

10:02 top story. And in case you missed it overnight, the

10:05 two presidents had a phone call. President Biden and President Xi Jinping

10:09 spoke on the phone first time, in fact, one on one communication here since

10:12 November. Let's bring in our guest.

10:14 Guy Bill will go to talk us through this managing director, Teneo.

10:17 He joins us from Philadelphia today. Gabriel, thank you so much for for

10:21 joining us. And fairly short notice on this.

10:24 Two versions out, if you will. There's a White House readout.

10:27 This also, of course, the readout out of Xinhua News Bridge that gap for us.

10:33 What does that look like to you? Well, we know these readouts are pitched

10:38 largely to domestic audio. And says and that means both leaders

10:41 have to reference the issues that they care most about in their publics care

10:45 most about. So it can give the impression that the

10:48 two leaders talk past each other or that the accounts are inconsistent.

10:52 But I actually saw quite a bit of commonality in terms of the tone, which

10:56 was cordial, which was friendly, and continue the spirit I think we saw last

11:01 year in San Francisco. So the kind of fragile rapprochement is

11:05 still on track for the moment. I think that's the the tone coming from

11:08 both of those readouts. And Gabriel, is is it because both sides

11:15 are just dealing with so many other factors here right now in China,

11:19 particularly it's a weaker economy, but also what's going on in the Middle East

11:23 is really, you know, taking a lot of President Biden's time now.

11:28 Yeah. Both leaders have their own reasons to

11:31 try to keep relations relatively stable this year.

11:33 The Biden administration doesn't need another foreign policy crisis on top of

11:37 Ukraine and the Middle East. And President Xi is seems more squarely

11:43 focused on the economy now than he did last year when he sometimes seemed

11:47 distracted by probably by the internal political turmoil, the purges in the

11:52 military and in the cabinet. So right now, both leaders have their

11:58 domestic problems. And, you know, in the long term, I think

12:02 the direction of the relationship hasn't changed.

12:04 But for this year, I mean, the other factor, of course, is that, you know, I

12:07 don't think Beijing sees much, much point in trying to engage in deep

12:11 negotiations with an administration that might not be in power next year with the

12:15 Biden administration. They may have to totally reset their

12:17 strategy when when there's regime change in Washington.

12:22 Yeah. So maybe just walk us through I mean, we

12:24 see a rapprochement now. The good vibes may continue till

12:26 November. And then you're saying once this

12:28 election happens, all bets are off. What happens then?

12:31 You think, Gabriel? Well, look, we look at the situation in

12:35 Washington. I mean, Democratic control of of the

12:38 Senate has been a brake on some of the the more hawkish anti-China proposals

12:43 coming out of Congress. Tick Tock is the latest example of that.

12:46 But the backbenchers in the House are are are are advancing legislation on

12:52 China every day, or at least proposing it.

12:55 If Republicans take the Senate in in next year, which I think is quite

13:01 possible, then that could open the floodgates for more legislation.

13:05 And and in China, of course, we have the response function to Taiwan, where

13:14 President William Lee, as he grows more confident in office, is more likely, I

13:17 think, to engage in provocations to which Beijing would have to respond.

13:22 So. So that's why next year looks

13:24 potentially rockier than this one. Yeah, to your point, a lot of that will

13:30 really depend on who, who, who the next president, US president, will be post

13:34 November election. Let me take that a step further.

13:37 Gabriel In what way do you think President Xi and China indirectly could

13:42 help President Biden win a second term? Well, I think

13:50 staying off the the front pages, I think if if China ends up being a major issue

13:56 in this election, I think that's probably negative for President Biden,

14:01 because Republicans or especially former President Trump is probably going to be

14:07 seen by voters as the quote unquote, tougher candidate against China.

14:10 So if there's some kind of unexpected incident, if we have a repeat of the

14:14 balloon incident, for example, or if we have some incident in the South China

14:17 Sea where China jumps back into the front pages and interrupts the issues

14:22 that that that President Biden wants to focus on in the campaign, you know, that

14:27 would hurt him by keeping those things steady this year.

14:30 That's probably what Beijing could do, although I don't think Beijing

14:34 necessarily has a strong preference for one candidate or the other.

14:38 And what should we be watching out for, in particular in terms of where we might

14:42 see the tensions rise again? Mean, obviously, this tick tock law has

14:46 been stalled in some ways in the Senate. And then you have a little bit more

14:49 concerns about Chinese EVs as well. I mean, you know how you see those two

14:54 things playing out now? Well, Secretary Yellen will be traveling

15:00 to China this week and or next week, and she's going to press this industrial

15:05 overcapacity issue. And EVs are the are the the main case in

15:10 point for for what the what Washington sees as as China's unfair economic

15:14 practices. And Congress is fired up as well about

15:18 the potential flood of EVs coming in from Mexico.

15:21 The administration has to find a way to finesse that issue.

15:24 They have to they want to block the vehicles coming in from Mexico, Chinese

15:28 branded vehicles that may flow in from Mexico, but they have commitments under

15:32 the USMCA that would prevent them from taking the more obvious steps.

15:36 Whatever they do, whether it's banning, you know, connected vehicles with

15:40 Chinese origin technology, you know, that could provoke tensions with

15:44 Beijing. And, you know, that's the biggest issue,

15:48 I think, circulating around Washington right now.

15:50 Even if this tick tock thing kind of takes a break, as I believe the Senate

15:54 looks looks like they will not take that up.

15:57 But the EV issue, I think, is the main focus in Washington right now.

16:02 Gabriel, it's great to have you, Gabriel, with all their managing

16:04 director at now joining us here this evening.

16:07 We're taking a look at more on what goes on with that renminbi fixture.

16:10 And you once again see a strong support from the PBOC at 709 49.

16:15 Of course, we've seen just the spread between the estimates as well as the

16:20 fakes have been so wide, even when it comes to the spot pricing

16:25 and the fixing, it just continues to show how much depreciation pressure

16:29 there is on the currency, Right? Yeah.

16:30 So it's a third straight day. We've had a fix to your point of on a

16:33 spread above 1400 pips. This one is slightly narrower than

16:38 yesterday. We're looking at about 1350.

16:41 But all that being said, right, the last week has certainly been very close to a

16:45 record spread there from based on defects.

16:46 And and really our estimates are a little bit more news coming out of

16:51 Taiwan. And in case you missed it, of course,

16:52 the big one, which well, the big quake literally happened 2 minutes before 8

16:57 a.m. local time there, 7.4 and some video

17:00 coming through as well here. And you really literally see that

17:04 shaking as we speak. A 6.4 quake has again hit.

17:09 This is an aftershock 11 kilometres northeast of Hualien City in Taiwan.

17:15 That's based on the USGS data. TSMC has told us, of course, and has

17:20 told us basically it came out and said it has to be evacuated some of its

17:24 production staff. There we go.

17:25 There's plenty more ahead. We'll keep you guys updated on this

17:27 story as we also approach the China market open.

17:30 And also here in Hong Kong, 13 minutes away, you're watching the China show.

17:44 All right. Get our story when it comes to futures

17:46 here, as we count down to this open just about 10 minutes or so away.

17:49 Seven 2588 for your dollar. Offshore, of course, are watching very

17:53 closely what goes on with the onshore rate as well, just given that we

17:57 basically have hit the highs of China for this year.

18:02 And for more, let's bring in our executive editor for Asia markets, Paul

18:05 Dobson. Here in the studio with us is also our

18:07 effects of rates. Reporter Tanya Chen.

18:08 Tanya, I'll start with you. Another day of strong support from the

18:11 PBOC. But, you know, given the better data,

18:15 we're still not seeing any sort of change in the narrative when it comes to

18:19 the renminbi right now. This seems to be a Fed story still.

18:21 Yes, exactly. So I guess to zero in on the yuan fix

18:26 today, as David mentioned, it's kind of around 1350 pips.

18:30 We're not seeing it at the strongest fixing gap since late last year when we

18:34 saw the yuan, I think, hit 7.35. And that was the weakest on record since

18:39 we've been tracking the data. I think what we're now paying attention

18:43 to this week is how much the PBOC will tolerate the yuan hitting that week end

18:48 of the trading band rate. So we have this range today.

18:50 The weekend is 7.2368 and as David mentioned previously, the Offshore has

18:57 already been trading weaker than the weakest part of the onshore.

19:01 So you see all of this really bearishness, sentiment still really

19:05 building. In previous episodes, the PBOC had

19:08 squeeze shorts, they had tightened liquidity offshore to just basically

19:12 punish all the bears. We haven't seen it as dramatic as it was

19:16 last year. So you have to ask the question, is this

19:18 time different? Because now they know it's really driven

19:21 by this yield differential with the US and just kind of it out there.

19:25 We're still around 280 pips on the two year for the CG versus the two year on

19:30 the Treasury. So it's still very wide.

19:32 Paul, I'll bring you in at that point. The time you just mentioned, is this a

19:36 you know, we were talking about this on the show yesterday.

19:38 The Indonesian rupiah hit lowest since 2020.

19:41 Don't get me started on the Japanese currency.

19:44 Is this a Fed story? It's largely it's largely a Fed story

19:50 about those interest rate differentials that are really driving everything going

19:53 on in the currency market. Strong dollar, not just strong dollar,

19:56 strong European currencies as well. So relative to what we have here in

20:03 terms of Asia is where those outlooks for monetary policy are

20:08 changing. And at the moment we're looking at

20:10 higher interest rates for longer and in Europe.

20:13 How much of Europe and also in the US and that's really kind of driving that

20:18 difference in the exchange rates. Also, I think just the growth outlook as

20:23 well, particularly the US, which just remains super strong in terms of the

20:28 economy, which is obviously feeding into the Fed

20:32 rate bets as well. And European growth is starting to look

20:35 more attractive as well. So in terms of where do you want to have

20:38 your money right now in those growth areas, in the places

20:42 where manufacturing is really coming back to life again?

20:45 Looks like it looks like a decent prospect relative to Asia, where we're

20:49 still kind of recovering, but a little bit of an uneven way still, particularly

20:55 China. And Tanya, it's interesting, we were

20:59 about to get into a four day weekend in China.

21:02 We're going to have a U.S. jobs report on Friday.

21:04 Powell set to speak here today, later on today.

21:07 I mean, the challenges facing the renminbi is likely just to keep

21:11 intensifying. Yes, exactly.

21:13 So you just kind of brought up the biggest point, which is liquidity is

21:16 already a stressful issue right now for traders.

21:19 You're seeing it in the four points. And so going ahead, you know, a lot of

21:24 these traders, they're going to be wondering how are they going to price in

21:27 the US yields? And you're seeing this spill over into

21:30 Thailand as well. The story is the same in the yen right

21:35 now. I think.

21:36 I think these central banks, they're just their hands are really tied.

21:39 I mean, with the PBOC, the biggest issue right now is they have this impossible

21:43 trinity framework, right, where you can technically lean on a weaker yuan to

21:47 help them stimulate and revive growth In previous years.

21:53 In previous quarters, this was primarily an issue because they were facing this

21:57 kind of deflationary this deflationary environment.

22:02 And now potentially they were hoping that the Fed could potentially ease

22:05 rates later, therefore giving them more room to also cut rates themselves.

22:10 Given that the expectations around the Fed are starting to slowly taper, given

22:14 the strong, robust economy and in the US, it's really kind of altering the

22:19 central bank's theme framework in terms of tackling the strong dollar.

22:23 Paul, just a final word from you. Other things happening in the world, oil

22:26 prices are moving higher. This Chinese equity market may be might

22:30 hit the 20% rally threshold from that low.

22:33 What's top of mind for your team today? What else?

22:38 Yeah, well, I mean, I think that this is one of the things we're trying to

22:41 grapple with, the decent looking equities versus the weak currencies,

22:46 particularly in in Asia. It speaks to the kind of uneven, uneven

22:51 growth that I was thinking about, particularly in China.

22:54 You look down on the one column, you've got some good news, you've got signs of

22:57 manufacturing, better exports, a little bit of confidence returning now.

23:01 And the downside in the second column, you've got property, property, property,

23:04 property and all of the the woes that come with that and the disinflationary

23:08 impulses. And, you know, it's it's not like a new

23:11 story for us or anything else, but we're still waiting for those circuit

23:14 breakers. There's more and more signs of efforts

23:17 to turn things around, but it's such slow progress.

23:19 And until that happens, you know, for all the equities can show some strength.

23:23 It's it's only in some sectors it's not an overall recovery in the in the

23:27 economy that would give more breadth and a more more sort of strength to that

23:31 kind of a rebound. Team.

23:35 Thank you. Paul Dobson in Singapore, Tanya Chen

23:37 here in our studio for us on all things markets today.

23:41 As we were just pointing out that we are approaching this 20% threshold on the

23:45 rally HCI. The Hang Seng China index, 19.2%.

23:49 We get to that level at six. It doesn't seem looking at futures,

23:52 though, That's going to happen. That's going to happen today.

23:54 But we've come a long way, as Paul mentioned.

23:55 You got to wonder, the weakness in the currency is so different from what we're

24:00 seeing when it comes to the optimism around stocks.

24:02 Right. This divergence, can it actually last or

24:05 at one point will the currency risk really drag down equities?

24:08 In some ways it was anxious to tell you about here today.

24:10 Of course, there's a lot that are earnings related.

24:13 China Wang Co Asia's race to accumulate CLSA Jiangxi copper shares raised to a

24:17 by a factor research and we have ZTE a shares cut to hold at HSBC.

24:23 All right Stocks to watch, though, today.

24:24 We're watching very closely what happens with Tesla, given their sales were a

24:27 disappointment here. So the EV sector very much in focus.

24:30 We're also watching what happens at Country Garden.

24:32 We're still hearing that the stock is suspended, but sales for March plunged

24:37 83%. We're also watching oil, right, with

24:40 Brent getting close to 90 bucks. WTI breaking 85 oil certainly in play

24:45 here this morning. Yep.

24:46 There we go. The opening bell 3 minutes away.

24:49 This is the China show.

25:07 Welcome back to watching the China show. We're talking down to the open of

25:10 markets. And obviously, what's been top of mind

25:12 is, is this phone call between Presidents Xi and Biden that happened

25:16 yesterday. And certainly maybe that helps with the

25:18 sentiment. Not quite seen that here today.

25:20 We're seeing a flat Hang Seng the pre-market.

25:22 We're still watching, of course, those shares after rallying some 20% or so.

25:27 But that weakness of the currency is still very much the dollar moves in play

25:31 here, David. And of course, we're still tracking what

25:33 is happening with those earthquakes in Taiwan, in Japan this morning.

25:36 Yeah, we're still seeing some headlines coming through, really very strong

25:41 aftershocks. The latest one that dropped, of course,

25:43 out of Holyhead, I think it was 12 kilometres northeast of the city of 6.4.

25:48 And in four of years it missed at 7.4 was the magnitude of the initial strong

25:54 one, which had 2 minutes before eight local time out base in the US.

25:56 Just more on that in a moment. The is looking like this as if one is

25:59 pointing out. And in a moment we'll show you, of

26:01 course, where we are as far as that specific index is concerned.

26:05 The Hang Seng China index were flat to lower at about Europe.

26:08 And Iran was also pointing out the Fed story of Jay Powell speaking.

26:12 And then you had the jobs report coming through.

26:14 And on top of that, to make things more complicated, China is actually shut from

26:18 tomorrow. So you don't really have to sort of

26:22 limit to to how weak the currency can get onshore and offshore.

26:26 Of course, you're still going to get that that movement as well.

26:29 725 The Fix today was about a 1350 1350 pips fixed to the estimate offshore.

26:36 It has actually been trading. If you juxtapose that on an actual chart

26:40 that's actually been trading already above the 2% range on the onshore

26:44 onshore, it obviously has to hold below that specific level.

26:47 But all that being said, of course, rate differentials are really pushing that

26:50 aside. Now, all that being said, I mentioned

26:52 the Hang Seng China index. Have a look at where we are right now.

26:54 It's a Jan 22 this year, if we're not mistaken, was actually low.

26:58 Thank you so much. There we go.

27:00 From that point up until about yesterday, 19%, given the weakness we're

27:05 seeing today, maybe we don't cross 20%. Now, sometimes we some would refer to

27:12 that as a bull market context is how we key here.

27:15 You know, some questions are on state buying, really pushing sentiment higher

27:19 as well. And of course, broadly speaking, of

27:21 course, over the longer term, if you zoom out on this chart.

27:23 But we you know, you barely even see the 60% rally earnings out of Malta

27:27 yesterday, beating estimates that should come out here.

27:29 Top of your screens, NIO and xpeng. There's also the Tesla story down 4% in

27:35 the US of course that pulling down and of course that and of course of be wide

27:40 there we go at 1.3 and two and a half percent in the open and also the oil

27:44 story 85 in West Texas almost 91 Brent oil related stocks have actually been

27:52 the best performer. And there's not even a close second

27:55 really globally when you look at equity flows and equity price and equity

27:59 performance this year. Just a look at the open here.

28:01 Some of these oil today, the place and as you can see here in one, it's really

28:04 moving against the grain, against the grain of this weaker open in greater

28:08 China. And you got to wonder if the Fed's

28:09 watching that right. These upsize risks to inflation when it

28:11 comes to the energy price and whether that suggests that higher for longer is

28:15 going to be the narrative that stays across these markets for some time.

28:19 And you're certainly seeing on the fixed income markets, you're starting to feel

28:22 a little bit when it comes to stocks as well.

28:24 Let's bring in Catherine Young, investment director at Fidelity

28:26 International. She joins us here in our Hong Kong

28:28 studios. It seems like there is a little bit of a

28:30 pivot back to China in some ways. How real is it?

28:34 Well, hopefully it is real. But what's been very interesting in this

28:36 current earnings season is that the focus many companies across a number of

28:40 sectors, by the way, have on shareholder returns predominantly through dividends

28:45 as well as buybacks, and whether that's because of shareholders basically

28:50 demanding this share price weakness with some of the buybacks or even CRB

28:54 reforms. It's a definite trend that's coming

28:56 through this reporting season. Is that indicative of where we are or

29:02 where we are in this rally or recovery in the equity market when we get things

29:05 like this? For example, if you think back, I think

29:08 it was even on one of your shows back in 2017, we started gauging this whole

29:12 dividend story and that Chinese companies, mainly the state owned

29:16 enterprises, were pivoting towards this focus.

29:19 And of course we have the social KPIs, which are very much coming through not

29:22 with every single company in terms of fulfilling this, but potentially because

29:27 you're seeing not just utility companies, financials companies in that

29:31 sort of mature part of the cycle. You're seeing some of the Internet

29:34 companies, consumer companies also join this phase.

29:37 And maybe this is why this focus on returning value to shareholders is

29:41 becoming more prominent. And of course, maybe even the Japanese

29:44 influence with the change in corporate governance.

29:46 There could also be underpinning what we're seeing in China.

29:49 It's interesting because I think Morgan Stanley came on the show a few weeks

29:53 back and highlighting this exact theme. You know, actually reform has been

29:57 around for several years And has that been a winning trade?

30:00 If you had if one had followed informed investment strategy around the

30:05 theme of as we've. You just let me borrow a career phrase

30:08 and value a program of career. Would you have made money?

30:11 Probably not against the growth stocks initially, but more recently.

30:15 But I think that focus, especially for the domestic investor, is important.

30:18 So if capital markets are going to continue to develop and households

30:22 deploy their money into equities or fixed income, that search for yield is

30:27 going to be somewhat of a cushion during periods of volatility.

30:31 And you're saying that you're seeing it across many sectors.

30:33 Where is that trend the most prominent now in this earnings season?

30:36 It's been in financials. Okay.

30:38 So the large so we have either been supporting or stabilizing demand or

30:43 increasing their dividend. Some of the smaller fintech guys have

30:46 also been increasing their payouts, doing buybacks.

30:50 What's key, though, is the sustainability of all this, whether

30:53 again, you're a consumer or financial company.

30:55 So, for example, with the banks we like, we think that this trend is going to

30:58 continue in terms of the support for payouts, given that these companies have

31:03 the ability to generate cash flows without jeopardizing capital adequacy.

31:07 It's a great theme and certainly a great idea.

31:09 I wonder how receptive are investors to the idea?

31:12 I think, you know, given that China has been out of favor for some years now,

31:17 the idea that it's a cushion or a different aspect into just looking for

31:22 growth, I think could attract some investors.

31:25 But I do think this so we reforms again across sectors is tangible and

31:29 especially over the past year we're seeing this and also the shareholder

31:33 voice is becoming louder. I think companies are in fact listening

31:36 to that. You touched on something about RSU.

31:39 We don't talk about this too much in the show.

31:40 Maybe you can clarify they're switching stock options to these or how does it

31:44 work? Yeah, restricted share units.

31:47 So essentially it's like a stock option for employees.

31:50 But in terms of the dilution, it can be controlled.

31:53 So as an example, one such consumer company we spoke to did this transfer to

31:58 RSU and the dilution of shares per annum.

32:01 You it went from about 3 to 5% to a very controlled level.

32:04 So a couple of these Internet companies, consumer companies are sort of

32:08 gravitating towards this. And again, it's rewarding the

32:11 shareholders effectively as well as the employees themselves.

32:15 The general sentiment among your clients these days is what and not just on

32:19 China, like how how are people thinking about taking on more or less risk as we

32:23 move into the second quarter? I think people are just mindful or

32:26 cognizant of what happens rate wise around the world, especially with the

32:29 Fed and it's all data dependent. We even get messaging now out of the

32:33 Federal Reserve members about just depending on data whether they actually

32:37 pursue these three cuts. China is obviously very dependent on

32:41 data, Japan across the entire region. And so I think it's almost a bit of

32:45 treading water and looking for the opportunities.

32:48 But definitely for China, it's about whether the profitability does come

32:51 through with companies. Catherine, I'm afraid we have to cut

32:54 this short, shorter than usual. Catherine Yang out of Fidelity

32:58 Investment director there. We'll take it straight now to this live

33:01 briefing taking place in Japan on this big earthquake, of course, that hit not

33:04 just Taiwan and also also Japan. In Okinawa, Naha airport has now halted

33:09 arrivals and departures from that as well.

33:12 Okay. So we're going pretty old school here in

33:14 terms of that, the where we are as far as the data,

33:18 the data on some of these earthquakes are concerned.

33:22 There we go. Press briefing taking place.

33:25 That's the JMA there, of course, top of the top right of your screens.

33:28 More on this in a moment. We'll talk more about TSMC as well.

33:32 This is Bloomberg.

33:41 It's been an epic disaster, not just in terms of the delivery number, but the

33:46 strategy. Are you going to cut prices, whole

33:49 margins? And investors right now feeling

33:52 blindfolded, almost like playing darts blindfolded.

33:56 And these were what no one was expecting.

33:58 A good quarter. But this was pick your heart, chef of

34:01 Friday the 13th, Marin Elm Street. That's what this quarter was.

34:08 We wish security as managing Director Dan Ives there on Tesla's disappointing

34:11 sales numbers. Joining us now to talk more about that,

34:14 let's bring in our transport reporter for Asia, Linda Liu.

34:18 It just goes to show, right, these these price wars that we're seeing in China is

34:22 really weighing on Tesla, too. Oh, for sure.

34:24 I think analysts were already kind of lowering their estimates for this

34:29 quarter, but Tesla came in even below that.

34:32 So it's just a really ugly picture right now.

34:35 This wasn't it. It is.

34:37 I think for the past seven years, this is the biggest margin they've missed

34:41 analysts estimates. So really what's happened to Tesla is

34:45 that their production at Berlin has been affected.

34:49 Their second largest market, which is China, is going through this intense

34:53 price war, huge competition, and the global demand is weak.

34:58 So Tesla going forward has a lot of challenges.

35:01 What does it I'm wondering whether it's still worth talking about March, the

35:05 domestic EV market, because some of the deliveries were actually quite strong.

35:09 I could be away, for example, for sure, because you look at Tesla's biggest

35:13 rival, BYD, the march sales actually came in very strong.

35:17 They were 46% compared to last year, taking the first quarter deliveries to

35:23 well over 600,000 vehicles. Now, the interesting thing is why these

35:29 EV sales, which is about six, which is about 300,000 vehicles, is actually

35:37 lower now than Tesla's 386,000. So it is giving back this crown of the

35:43 world's largest electric vehicle maker back to Tesla.

35:46 And this rivalry between Tesla and Bhiwadi, it seems like Tesla's coming

35:50 back up on top again, at least for this quarter.

35:52 The last quarter. Yeah, definitely.

35:54 If we just look at the metric of pure electric vehicles, then Tesla is back on

35:58 top. But looking out into this year, both of

36:01 them will have a very hard time trying to keep this momentum going.

36:05 Okay, Linda, thank you so much. Linda Lee there, our Asia transport

36:08 reporter. That's pivot.

36:10 Now, just to borrow a phrase from potentially the Fed

36:13 to property to country Garden has revealed to you, look at March sales,

36:18 home sales plunging 83% on year $590 million.

36:23 It follows an 85% annual slide and said that as sales drought worsens, the cash

36:28 crunch for the company that's already facing a wind up petition.

36:32 Country Garden also said last week it would miss.

36:35 And by the way, it did miss an annual reporting deadline.

36:38 Yeah, which is why the stock is still suspended this morning.

36:41 Meanwhile, Bloomberg Intelligence has been crunching the numbers and saying

36:44 that falling sales for state owned developers could be a warning that the

36:47 tentacles of China's property crisis are starting to engulf some of the stronger

36:53 names. For more, let's bring in our Bloomberg

36:54 Intelligence China property analyst Kristie Hong.

36:57 Tell us more about the issues at play still.

36:59 Right. So we've been seeing weaker sales from

37:01 same developers and that is raising the question on whether the property crisis

37:06 is starting to engulf the stronger names with state owned background.

37:12 So in 2023, we see that strong developers, they consistently their

37:16 sales growth would outperform the sector average.

37:19 But in just the fourth first quarter this year, we see a lot of state owned

37:22 names that they are having a steep sales decline than the sector average.

37:27 And I think that draws our attention to a problem where we used to have a

37:31 problem of buyers avoiding private developers price of homes.

37:37 But now that seems to be shifting to a problem of buyers avoiding buying any

37:41 properties in general. And we have the Yankees prices that's

37:46 escalating. I think that would be another tipping

37:48 point low in confidence on the back names.

37:53 Yeah, and it does underscore maybe that they might need to do more in terms of,

37:59 you know, if this spreads into as so it back and as again two different things

38:03 right. What does this white paper not tell us

38:05 about the potential funding gap that's needed or support from the government

38:08 that's actually needed? Right.

38:09 So right now, the weak confidence comes from buyers worrying about know projects

38:15 might not be completed. And the government is doing more in

38:17 terms of, you know, pushing out this white list, which is local authorities

38:21 identifying property projects that are in need of funding to support that

38:26 completion. And you know, what we know so far is

38:30 that there are around 6000 projects that have been identified by local

38:35 authorities. And, you know, if we assume and around

38:38 to ¥30 million funding per project, that would add up to around ¥1.4 trillion

38:45 financing needs that we need to complete our pre-sale projects in China.

38:49 And bear in mind, this is just the first batch.

38:51 A lot of cities are already pushing out the second batch, so the potential

38:55 number would be bigger. That's a huge number, right?

38:57 Are the banks willing to support that? Yes.

39:00 So what we are seeing so far is banks have been very selective.

39:04 We give you an example that of best a second.

39:07 It's called Kunming. It identified 212 projects on the white

39:11 list so far. What we know is only two projects have

39:14 been able to secure funding. So banks have been selective.

39:18 They want to find projects with cash recoverability and projects with ample

39:23 collateral. So what we need now is that, you know,

39:27 for low tier cities, we know that south has been very difficult and banks might

39:32 not be willing to support those projects because we know that even if those

39:36 projects complete, buyers might not be willing to buy them to generate enough

39:40 cash flow to repay the debt. All right, Christine, thank you.

39:43 Christine Wong there from Bloomberg Intelligence, who covers China property

39:46 for us. We're just getting some numbers crossing

39:48 here when it comes to chasing China PMI services number, which is better than

39:53 expected. So 52.7 came out here as well.

39:56 So they we're seeing starting a trend, David, in some ways of the data

40:01 certainly looking better and actually beating expectations.

40:04 This is it's rare that you get a consistent read through across both

40:08 Taishan and the official numbers coming through.

40:10 It actually disappoint both improving both better than estimates, which

40:14 actually bodes well I think we were talking with China show yesterday from

40:17 our economics team and they actually think all the PMI numbers that have come

40:20 through are do bode well for the activity numbers which they think will

40:24 come in better than what their initial thinking was.

40:27 Yeah. For them.

40:28 Yeah. And signs up maybe even the export cycle

40:31 is bottoming out and even actually coming back in a big way which we were

40:34 talking to some guest yesterday about there's a global cyclical upturn which

40:38 we're seeing across the world, not just the U.S..

40:41 All right. We're going to recap a little bit what's

40:42 going on in Taiwan, the situation there. What we're hearing from the Japan

40:46 authorities now is that there's a new tsunami warning for Okinawa that's been

40:52 downgraded to a tsunami advisory. But we're still hearing from reports of

40:57 aftershocks in Taiwan. 6.4 was the latest one, I believe, to

41:01 come through was it was one of the latest once it comes to 5.2, shortly

41:05 after that, all but just about north northeast of Dalian City.

41:11 In case you missed it, Taiwan almost 2 hours back was hit by the strongest

41:17 earthquake in 25 years. We're just showing you some video

41:20 footage, of course, goes coming through as well as Taipei.

41:23 Just a distress, though. This is the city center right of the

41:26 capital. But where you're actually seeing the

41:28 subway system there, it's actually kind of shaking.

41:33 So we're continue to watch very closely what goes on.

41:35 And the damage report, obviously, TSMC, of course, we're still tracking that.

41:40 Markets, though, I have to say, Dave, are taking it in stride so far.

41:43 Yeah, I mean, we did open lower and weaker.

41:45 We are still weaker about seven, 8/10 of 1%.

41:49 I guess in many ways we're still trying to figure out what the damage is looking

41:52 like as well, because the 7.4 certainly on the headline does indicate that this

41:56 was really on the stronger side of things.

41:58 TSMC down 1.4%, as you can see on your screens.

42:02 Plenty more ahead. This is Bloomberg.

42:24 Welcome back to the China show. Here's a look at the CSI 300 just a half

42:28 hour into the session here right now. Not a whole lot of conviction across

42:30 these markets. Of course, it's a shortened holiday week

42:33 for China as they shut down for the next two days on Thursday and Friday for the

42:37 Qingming Festival. So certainly the weakness of the

42:40 currency is certainly one we're checking very closely.

42:42 And still our top story this morning, Taiwan and really the impact we're

42:46 talking about on supply chains and chip makers like TSMC.

42:49 Dave Yeah, we're still getting more headlines coming through there and in

42:52 fact in the form in the last few minutes of corporates giving us a sense really

42:56 of what what precautions they are taking there on the back of the strongest

43:00 earthquake in 25 years to a large extent.

43:05 You're also looking at some headwinds across risk assets today.

43:07 We did hear, of course, from Algo Grandmaster overnight, just really

43:11 talking about how the Fed will really need to wait, although June, July has

43:15 now been priced back in as far as that first rate cut is concerned.

43:18 We're starting to talking about three. I'd even add to that.

43:21 Maybe you can talk more about this later when we hit Mark Cranfield on and really

43:25 how inflation just about almost everywhere I'd say

43:29 is starting to really come in Europe was a very good example of that this week so

43:33 far in fact it's come down as much at April 11 on the ECB might actually be

43:38 might actually be quite live 107 72 here on Eurodollar dollar.

43:41 As you can see, some of your major benchmarks across the region.

43:44 Nikkei costs the ASX more on Taiwan in a moment are still seeing some downside

43:49 might have to do with the fact that the dollar index at these levels of both the

43:52 Bloomberg dollar index and the dollar index itself are either at or near the

43:57 highest levels of the year. Speaking of highest levels of the year,

44:00 change things up and you're looking at treasuries right here.

44:03 You actually have two, five, ten and 30 long dated yields are actually back to

44:09 levels at the highest since the start of the year, if not going back to about

44:13 November. So your yield curve is actually trading

44:15 at 450 and 434. We're at the highest levels here.

44:19 It's going back several months, five year yield, 4.33%.

44:23 A couple of things on deck. You have Jay Powell, of course, coming

44:26 coming up as far as a conversation is concerned and of course, the jobs report

44:30 and all of that really complicated by the fact when you talk about Dollar

44:33 China, for example, as an iteration of that want is pointing this out.

44:37 You know, we're shot tomorrow on mainland China, shot tomorrow and

44:39 Friday, Hong Kong shut tomorrow and then reopens Friday.

44:42 If I were to take a long weekend move, that that's a different conversation, I

44:46 promise you. We'll talk about Taiwan.

44:47 Here we go. We open weaker.

44:49 I believe we're now eight, 9/10 of 1% to the downside.

44:52 And the latest we've heard and we're now trading closer to 1% session lows.

44:56 You, AMC, bottom of your screens, also session lows and that one as well.

45:00 They have halted some of their operations.

45:03 They're trying to figure out based on the headline coming to headlines coming

45:07 through that they're still trying to figure out when they can get in on some

45:12 of those headlines, some of some of those machines to come back online.

45:16 Yes. We also heard from TSMC, among other

45:18 things, of course, that this has really been a story we've been tracking these

45:21 last 2 hours. And as we were talking to our analysts,

45:23 Robert Lee, you know, given the fact that most of these factories are located

45:26 on the western part of the island, potentially the disruptions may not have

45:31 that big of an impact. But nevertheless, you are seeing that

45:34 these companies are taking precautions here.

45:36 They're evacuating some of the workers. You see the latest that came out in the

45:39 last couple of minutes, evacuated some facilities and seemed you as well as

45:43 Tynan. And they're talking a little bit more

45:45 about halting operations of some chipmaking machines, The live pictures

45:50 or at least these pictures that you're seeing.

45:52 These are from earlier this morning from Hualien.

45:54 This is the eastern part of the island. And this is where you're seeing most of

45:58 the impact being felt right now where buildings have collapsed.

46:02 We're hearing a little bit more from the President Tsai Ing Wen.

46:04 She is scheduled to visit the emergency center shortly around 10 a.m.

46:09 local time. So it could be any minute now and we're

46:12 expecting to get an official update then.

46:14 Dave. Yeah, and really what they planned here,

46:17 it's not just Taiwan, right? So this one actually here, it's been

46:21 almost 2 hours, if not just over 2 hours since the initial quake actually hit and

46:26 since then. And I'll bring in Japan to the

46:28 conversation. Since then, we've had a series of

46:30 developments almost as far as Japan is concerned.

46:32 About 20 minutes back, the government held a press briefing talking about the

46:36 details of this quake nearby Okinawa, which is near to where Taiwan is.

46:41 The airport, Naha Airport there has since halted departures and arrivals

46:46 into and out of that airport, but they also have downgraded the tsunami warning

46:53 to an advisory. Yes, right around Okinawa.

46:57 We're also hearing China has shut down some railway tracks when it comes to

47:00 Fujian and Jiangxi province is according to CCTV.

47:04 So certainly this is being felt all around the coast there.

47:08 For more, let's bring in our Bloomberg and my strategist, Mark Cranfield.

47:11 Mark, obviously this is our top story here.

47:13 You know, what sort of lasting impact do you think this could have, not just on

47:17 supply chains but overall on market sentiment to.

47:24 In terms of supply chains is way too early to be discussing that.

47:27 But I think in general you can tell why investors are taking a wait and see

47:32 approach. There's obviously a lot more information

47:34 needs to come through before you can make big decisions in terms of

47:38 investment. And as you were saying, a number of the

47:40 companies are situated on the other side of the country compared to where the

47:43 earthquake struck. So they may give them some protection,

47:47 but you have to step back and see it within the context that generally we're

47:51 in a very positive environment for global equities.

47:54 So people will be a bit reluctant to give up all their holdings here,

47:59 especially in Taiwan, which has been an outperformance there, one of the best

48:02 Asia markets already this year. So it would be you be reluctant to to

48:07 sell all your holdings of Taiwan until you're absolutely sure that this is

48:11 going to cause the country a problem which is going to really impact economic

48:14 growth, is going to be a deterrent to people putting in fresh money.

48:18 Until you've seen more details from the government and from the major companies

48:22 around the area. So that's why you're having a fairly

48:24 modest reaction so far, because if you do give up now and and it's really not a

48:30 major impact to the economy and the rest of the world continues to rally, then

48:35 you've just found yourself losing quite a bit of exposure to what has been a

48:38 very, very good market story this year, particularly because of companies like

48:42 Taiwan Semi. So that will certainly give people

48:45 reason to stand back and wait until they see all the details coming through on

48:50 whether they need to make a reassessment of the whole situation is obviously very

48:54 positive that the Taiwan stock market is still open, is still trading as normal,

48:59 which is a very good sign for investors. Mark, hold that thought.

49:03 Stay with us. I want to bring in our senior editor,

49:05 Adrienne Kennedy, who is joining us from our Taipei here this morning.

49:09 Adrienne, thank you so much for joining us.

49:11 And just bring us up to speed. What's the latest now?

49:16 Okay. Good morning.

49:17 So right at the moment, we are back to pretty much normal life in Taipei, which

49:22 was shaken very strongly at just 2 minutes before 8 a.m.

49:25 this morning. But rescue workers and authorities are

49:29 trying to assess the situation. And hopefully and our understanding at

49:32 the moment is that, you know, there may have been some house collapses over

49:35 there. It's possible that some people have been

49:37 trapped. My understanding is that there have been

49:40 no fatalities reported, which is fantastic news, obviously, because this

49:44 is an island which regularly gets earthquakes and has had some fairly

49:48 severe ones. The government assessed the scale of

49:52 this temblor, which I think the USGS put at 7.4 magnitude as being the most

49:57 severe since 1999, when the so-called 9 to 1 earthquake claimed more than 2000

50:02 lives. The initial response to the earthquake

50:07 was that there were some evacuations from facilities, including some TSMC

50:13 plants where they make high end semiconductor materials.

50:18 These are often precautionary and they don't necessarily indicate any

50:21 disruption to the supply chain. The maps of the earthquake plus the

50:26 aftershocks, which we've been feeling fairly regularly in the last hour and a

50:30 half, have indicated that they're mainly on the east of the island, which is

50:35 separated from the west of the island, which is the industrial zone by a large

50:40 mountain chain. So right now, I would assess that

50:45 Taiwan, Taipei itself appears to be fine.

50:48 I think schools are being given the option of closing if they need to.

50:52 The industrial sector of the island. We have seen some evacuations and there

51:00 are immediate assessments by the companies involved to see how much

51:03 damage there is. But we haven't had any indication that

51:06 there will be disruptions to supply. It's in the east, which is a little bit

51:10 more remote, where we have to try and wait for more information to see how

51:15 much damage there is and hopefully there will be no fatalities.

51:19 The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has now issued a statement that the tsunami

51:24 threat from Taiwan and the earthquake has now passed.

51:27 Adrian, you mentioned that it's business as usual.

51:29 Can you just talk us through? Did you have any trouble getting to work

51:32 today? How does the outside of the office look?

51:35 What's a general sense of is everything? Pretty much I wouldn't say back to

51:39 normal, but is everything operating almost at normal as far as Taipei is

51:44 concerned? Adrian.

51:47 Okay. Well, of course, Bloomberg, we get into

51:49 office a lot at the office a lot earlier than the quake struck.

51:52 But there was a little bit of disruption to

51:55 the MTA, the mass rapid transit system here.

51:59 There was a man standing as it was a brief suspension, but then it's resumed

52:05 travel. People are travelling around the city as

52:08 normal and things are back to normal.

52:12 You know, in most of this city that I can see, the one the one proviso I would

52:17 say is that Taiwan has had previous earthquakes where by there has been a

52:24 very minimum damage to most facilities and most buildings.

52:28 But in 2016, for example, there was a major earthquake in the south and the

52:33 overwhelming majority of casualties, which, you know, there were more than

52:37 100 fatalities occurred just because of a single building collapse.

52:41 So I guess the major concern is that like within Hualien, there are not

52:47 there's not damage which rescuers or officials have been unable to assess

52:52 yet. Adrian, thank you so much.

52:56 Adrian Kennedy there in Taipei for us. A line just crossing out of the USGS,

53:02 another 5.1 quake as at 31 kilometres east southeast of Hualien City.

53:09 Mark, I'll bring you back in. We talked about Taiwan.

53:11 I just wonder if we could pivot to other things taking place.

53:13 We woke up this morning to oil prices at five six month highs.

53:18 We could be touching 90 on Brent, for example.

53:20 How should we be thinking about this resurgence in energy prices?

53:26 It's probably overdone already. I think the

53:30 demand for oil probably isn't quite as great as what people really think, and

53:35 the supply situation is very good, especially coming out of the United

53:38 States. U.S.

53:40 supplies already eroding parts of their competitors in the rest of the world.

53:44 So we're probably near a peak in oil prices anyway.

53:47 But we we should actually be more worried about the strength of the US

53:52 economy because the numbers just keep on continuing to be so strong.

53:56 It's putting question marks about whether the Federal Reserve will be able

53:59 to start cutting interest rates by the middle of the year and that is beginning

54:04 to look quite unlikely. So we might be waiting even until the

54:07 fourth quarter before we can even get any rate, because this is such a change

54:11 from where we were at the beginning of the year when we were even considering

54:14 March as being the first time for an interest rate cut.

54:17 So huge change going on in people's perception of what the Fed is going to

54:21 do. And that matters a great deal more than

54:24 whether oil prices are 85 or $88 a barrel.

54:29 And you're feeling across the effects across this region.

54:32 And the renminbi certainly is in focus this morning.

54:35 Mark, you take a look at the fixing that we saw.

54:38 You were getting better data across the board.

54:40 It's not doing much to reverse the story on Dollar China.

54:44 Are we likely to see those depreciation pressures persist?

54:49 It's going to be hard for them to go away when you when you consider some of

54:53 that is outside China's control. They can't do much about the US dollar

54:57 side of the story. US dollar is extremely strong across the

55:01 globe because US interest rates are staying higher than people expected and

55:05 the US economy is doing exceptionally well.

55:07 So you got that on one side. So it's not just a yuan story.

55:10 The dollar is very strong everywhere. Then you compare monetary policy.

55:14 China would probably still like to ease policy a bit more this year, which

55:18 obviously goes in opposite direction to what's happening in the United States as

55:22 well. So that's a pressure for for China as

55:24 well. And it still to some extent is still

55:27 unproven, whether the Chinese economy really has the traction to get up to the

55:32 kind of GDP numbers which Beijing would like to see.

55:35 So there's a lot of doubts about where China is going and there are no doubts

55:39 about what's happening in the United States and some other parts of the

55:42 world. So we look at that diversion.

55:44 It's no wonder that yuan is underperforming.

55:47 But it's not just the yuan, the Japanese yen.

55:49 Most of Asia is doing the same. If dollar yen continues up to, say, 155,

55:55 we could have a crisis across the emerging markets because all the

55:58 currencies are being pressurized. We're already seeing the Indonesian

56:02 rupiah. They had to intervene to stabilize that

56:04 currency as well. They might not be the last.

56:06 So it's really a it's a global story, dollar strength.

56:09 And the yuan is just one of many currencies which are feeling the pain.

56:15 All right, Mark. Thank you so much.

56:16 Mark Greenfield there, joining us out of Singapore and from our Ml5 team.

56:20 I just want to recap some lines that we're crossing here in just the last

56:22 couple of minutes from Japan. This is from the chief cabinet

56:25 secretary, Yoshi Masayoshi. No reports of casualties and damage from

56:31 this Taiwan quake. So that's some good news on Japan side

56:34 of things. We're also hearing when it comes to the

56:36 tsunami threat from this Taiwan earthquake has now passed.

56:40 That is the latest here. But we're still continue to track some

56:43 of these aftershocks and the likes of Hualien City, Juan, with a 5.7 magnitude

56:48 earthquake just 24 kilometers east of of there.

56:52 So certainly we'll continue to watch this live.

56:54 Go for more updates. This is Bloomberg.

57:10 Yeah, that's certainly it. Are we going to get any cuts this year?

57:13 The jobs report is out on Friday. So you're pointing out that a crew from

57:16 surveillance will be all on top of that story.

57:18 Big picture, City economic surprise Index Global has actually hit near a one

57:22 year high and that so the question really remains, are things really that

57:26 good? Is it simply a US exceptionalism story?

57:30 Let's bring in Joanna, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Citigroup

57:33 Global Markets. Where are we in this cycle?

57:37 You know, it's a very confusing cycle, right?

57:39 So the US slowdown US keeps continuing to defy expectations in terms of its

57:43 prolonged exceptionalism. Yeah, I mean, I think that's really a

57:46 complicating story for obviously for Asia for IAM because we were kind of

57:49 starting in the year thinking we would get maybe five or six cuts at that and

57:53 then end up like, you know, obviously the Fed keep signaling three cuts and

57:56 the market is even paring back on the back of that.

57:58 So I think it's obviously a little bit of a challenging backdrop, but from a

58:01 growth perspective, clearly things are looking better in the US.

58:05 Normally that should. And we had also China manufacturing PMI

58:09 come out better than expected. So normally you would think for Asia the

58:12 lift to global manufacturing should be friendly for the region given that we're

58:15 an open kind of trading region. I think the challenges the story is a

58:19 lot is becoming a lot more uneven than we expected.

58:22 I mean, we have very good performance from the semiconductor, from the tech

58:26 outperformers like export data from Korea and Taiwan.

58:29 And we certainly have some lagging performance.

58:32 Certainly Europe has lagging performance, but certainly also parts of

58:35 ASEAN as well. We can still at least assume that this

58:37 export slump that we've seen in the region.

58:39 Is that behind us now? Well, I think the problem is definitely

58:42 global manufacturing PMI, we're the highest level since August 2022.

58:46 So we were starting the year thinking, oh, we would have a bit of a lift from

58:49 the global goods trade rebound. But again, I think what has disappointed

58:52 us is that aside from the kind of exceptional kind of semiconductor

58:55 stories driving Korea and Taiwan, we don't seem to be getting that same beta

58:59 lift. And I think part of the challenge really

59:01 is that China's growth, even though it's looking a little bit better than

59:04 expected and we've actually upgraded our China growth, it's a very unbalanced

59:08 growth rate. It's very much fueling supply production

59:11 and above all, focusing on advanced manufacturing and a lot of

59:14 infrastructure. And China is so competitive and so many

59:17 goods, not just on green tech, high end goods that is challenging Europe, but

59:22 it's so good in other even lower skill intensive goods.

59:24 And I think that's impacting some of the performance of exports, The

59:27 manufacturing cycle in certainly in parts of Southeast Asia like Thailand,

59:31 even Malaysia has had some disappointments.

59:33 That's interesting because you guys have written a lot about that, you know, in

59:37 recent years. China's actually in some ways move that

59:41 capacity to other parts of Southeast Asia.

59:43 What you're seeing is you're you're seeing that reshore reshoring back.

59:46 Well, okay. So definitely we've seen some China

59:49 movement. Definitely you're seeing that the data

59:51 from China investment in Vietnam, obviously to cater to US market, that

59:54 obviously is a way to insulate yourself. You're seeing China investment in

59:57 Mexico. But I think the challenges a lot of

01:00:00 ASEAN, a lot of Asia, China is still your core market, although you're

01:00:04 trading with the rest of the world. China is an important destination.

01:00:07 And if China's growth is very unbalanced and is overproducing.

01:00:10 It's one thing if you're Mexico and you're next to us, which is an over

01:00:13 consumer, it's another thing if you're a kind of ASEAN and your core market is an

01:00:17 older producer, it creates a lot of sort of a risk kind of crosswinds because

01:00:22 there's also a lot of price competition both in China's domestic market and then

01:00:26 also in your in your own market. So is that the impact really could be

01:00:29 felt mostly in ASEAN? I mean, what about North Asia?

01:00:32 Well, I think, again, we're seeing it like China has been exporting goods,

01:00:35 export goods, deflation since around the middle of last year.

01:00:39 And in some of the markets, like in chemicals, it's very, very dramatic.

01:00:42 So certainly non-tech goods rebound has been a little bit weaker than what we've

01:00:46 seen in the tech. But I think in Asia, I think you're

01:00:48 seeing a little bit more negative headwinds on some parts of ASEAN.

01:00:51 Like I mentioned to Thailand a little bit Malaysia, because again, if you're

01:00:54 not tied to the fast growing air supply chain on tech, you're a little bit more

01:00:59 disadvantaged. And if you're also producing stuff that

01:01:01 China can also produce in scale with a lot of competition, it's very, very

01:01:05 challenging. And despite competition in China, it's

01:01:07 not just impacting trade. I think it also has an impact a lot on

01:01:11 the tourism receipts. I mean, part of the reason why we're not

01:01:14 even though we're getting some visitor arrival travels from China, we're not

01:01:17 getting the spending power. It's not just because we thought, oh,

01:01:21 maybe because Chinese just don't feel confident about their financial

01:01:23 well-being. It's also because stuff in China is so

01:01:26 much cheaper and that incentivises spending patterns.

01:01:29 I mean, that's we're seeing it in Hong Kong, but I think it's impacting

01:01:32 Thailand and other places as well. Right.

01:01:34 So how does how does everyone so in what how does that show up?

01:01:39 Trade flows to the trade flows get, you know, shifted enough that it becomes

01:01:43 South Korea. Right.

01:01:44 So there's definitely a shift in trade flows.

01:01:46 The problem is, as you see, part of the reason why China is doing a little bit

01:01:49 better than expected is their exports are doing better than expected.

01:01:52 Normally when China does well, we tend to think manufacturing exporters and

01:01:55 commodity export benefit from China doing well.

01:01:57 But I feel that manufacturing exporters are struggling a little bit more, partly

01:02:01 because part of the reason why China is doing well is because its manufacturing

01:02:04 is so competitive and there's a bit of a substitution effect that's cannibalizing

01:02:08 and competing. Some of the other smaller manufacturers

01:02:11 and it's impact. That's why you have very uneven trading

01:02:14 patterns. It's interesting that you talk about,

01:02:17 you know, what what we saw on the manufacturers on the U.S., Right.

01:02:20 I don't think we've ever seen a Fed cut rates when manufacturing is up.

01:02:23 I think one year highs or unemployment's, you know, below 5%.

01:02:27 Do you think that they can actually cut them this year?

01:02:29 Well, this is the challenge, right? On the one hand, you can make an

01:02:31 argument or five and a half percent Fed funds rate is tight.

01:02:35 And to the extent that we've had some disinflation, maybe we're not yet at the

01:02:39 2% target, but we've had some core PC disinflation.

01:02:42 There's a there's there's an argument to be made that you want to calibrate your

01:02:45 monetary policy so that antivirale rates are not that high.

01:02:49 So there is room for cuts. And certainly it seems like they're

01:02:51 telling us seven you know, based on the disinflation pattern we've had, there's

01:02:55 room for a 75 basis points cut. I think the struggle is where do we go

01:02:59 from there? So if growth remains very resilient,

01:03:02 depending on where you think it's panning out, if us ends up having a

01:03:05 recession, which is currently Citi's House view, then you can make an

01:03:09 argument. Then there's even more that the Fed

01:03:11 could deliver even more than 75 basis point rate cut.

01:03:14 But the challenge is here, if the growth is quite resilient and, you know, we've

01:03:17 got elections going into next year, if we get a new administration that even

01:03:20 has more pro-cyclical fiscal policy, you could end up with a higher for longer

01:03:25 phenomena. And that's going to be a challenge,

01:03:26 obviously, for central banks in Asia in terms of the ability and timing and

01:03:30 quantum of delivering rate cuts. Right.

01:03:32 So Thailand comes to mind because a lot of people talk about how the next

01:03:36 meeting, which is I think in a few days, if I'm not mistaken, out of the Bank of

01:03:39 Thailand, that it might be like you think most of these things probably get

01:03:42 pushed back. So I think in Thailand, so we're making

01:03:44 a little bit of distinction. Some markets are very sensitive to Fed

01:03:47 policy, like Indonesia is quite sensitive.

01:03:49 But in Thailand, based on the data, because the first couple of months data

01:03:52 was actually quite weak and inflation is benign and we think they overhyped

01:03:57 because they were thinking this digital wallet scheme was going to come in.

01:04:00 It's not going to come this year. So we actually are expecting a cut in

01:04:03 April. We're expecting two cuts this year.

01:04:06 So Thailand as as well as China, are the only kind of two central banks we're

01:04:10 expecting will cut ahead of the Fed and everyone else will probably end up being

01:04:14 restrained by the Fed. Okay, Johanna, thank you so much.

01:04:17 Johanna Twi there, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Citigroup Global Markets.

01:04:21 We got plenty more had an update on this earthquake in Taiwan coming up.

01:04:25 This is Bloomberg.

01:04:34 All right. We continue to track this earthquake in

01:04:36 Taiwan and, of course, the aftershocks. We're still hearing the last couple

01:04:40 minutes at Taipei. Buildings have been reportedly shaking

01:04:43 once again. And just a bit of a tally from the

01:04:46 Taiwan government. So far, this earthquake has caused 26

01:04:51 buildings to collapse. For our Bloomberg clients, you can keep

01:04:54 on top of this story and it is a developing story as we speak as the

01:04:57 market in Taiwan, if I'm not mistaken, Is it session lows?

01:05:01 TSMC is now down 1.3%, as I guess some of these numbers continue to trickle

01:05:06 through to live. You go on your Bloomberg terminals.

01:05:09 Plenty more ahead. This is Bloomberg.

01:05:26 I actually saw quite a bit of commonality in terms of the tone, which

01:05:30 was cordial. That kind of fragile rapprochement is

01:05:33 still on track for the moment. I think that's the tone coming from both

01:05:37 of those readouts is largely about stopping things from getting worse,

01:05:41 better in terms of maybe more stable, more predictable, less volatile, but

01:05:47 better does not mean, you know, more robust engagement in trade and

01:05:54 cooperation on on commercial issues. All right.

01:06:01 I'm our guest this morning on the call between President Biden and his

01:06:04 counterpart, Xi Jinping, and their first one on one communication since November.

01:06:09 And obviously, we've been talking about just the readouts that come out from the

01:06:12 White House as well as what we've been hearing and reporting from Chinese

01:06:16 media, Shinhwa News. There's a bit of nuances, but we're

01:06:19 talking to Gabriel well now from Teneo saying, look, look at it.

01:06:23 It seemed to be overall friendly. Yeah.

01:06:25 In terms of what came out for both sides.

01:06:27 Yeah. When you look at it, that's a good

01:06:28 point. Right.

01:06:28 So you do have different versions, if you will, varying

01:06:33 different versions of the same call. And the point to be made to Gabriel

01:06:37 actually pointing out was that, you know, these are actually catered to

01:06:40 domestic audiences, right. So when you have the White House readout

01:06:44 and you have, of course, the statement coming out of Shinhwa talking about this

01:06:48 as well in terms of the areas of cooperation and fentanyl came up as

01:06:52 well, we understand from the White House version is that they did that.

01:06:57 Tik Tok was also brought up. AIG risks high risk on both cooperation

01:07:02 as far as managing the risks of that concern.

01:07:04 In fact, this is the Xinhua report, I believe.

01:07:06 Yes, because she noted that the US side has adopted a string of measures to

01:07:09 suppress China's trade in tech. This is not de-risking but creating

01:07:12 risks. Of course, I would imagine the spend

01:07:14 would be different When you look at what the US has to say about this specific

01:07:18 issue. Yeah, also Taiwan reaffirming that red

01:07:21 line there for the China side as well. It takes us into this upcoming trip.

01:07:25 Really see Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, she's headed to China this week.

01:07:30 Certainly part of the conversation is on potential tariffs and trade barriers

01:07:36 coming up. You know, earlier on, we talked about

01:07:39 the potential, of course, of flows of EVs from Mexico, for example.

01:07:42 That's really part and parcel, in fact, the crux of this specific issue as well.

01:07:46 This would be her second trip in nine months.

01:07:50 She is due to visit Gwangju, which is a major manufacturing hub, April 5th.

01:07:55 That's in two days time. And then she heads to Beijing.

01:07:57 She is expected to press Chinese officials on what the US calls into the

01:08:01 earlier point we were just making here industrial overcapacity that poses

01:08:06 threats to the rest of the world's economies.

01:08:08 Now the EU has joined, in fact, Washington and accusing China of

01:08:13 distorting global markets with that excess capacity.

01:08:17 But those claims are not always backed by data, backed up by data.

01:08:20 Let's let's bring in James Baker. He's with us right now.

01:08:23 I believe I believe it's James. James, are you there?

01:08:25 Just to make sure. There we go.

01:08:27 Just talk us through, of course, the push back here.

01:08:30 Is there an overcapacity issue in China? Let's start there.

01:08:35 There is an overcapacity issue. It really depends on what sectors you

01:08:39 want to look at and also on whether those sectors are tradeable or not.

01:08:42 I mean, if you think if you look at the housing sector, cement has a massive

01:08:45 overcapacity problem. Earlier this month, which Italy sorry,

01:08:50 early last month of Italy, March is not a great month for construction, but

01:08:54 cement capacity was running at about 30%.

01:08:56 So only 30% of capacity was being utilized in the cement industry, which

01:09:00 is, you know, incredibly low. And that's probably going to pick up a

01:09:03 little bit as the weather gets warmer and more construction happens.

01:09:06 But you're not going to see, you know, trying to build massive, huge amounts of

01:09:10 some implants over the last ten plus years as because the housing sector is

01:09:13 booming. And now with the collapse in housing

01:09:15 construction, that's obviously for a long way.

01:09:17 But that's not an exportable good. You can't trade cement.

01:09:19 You know, this is not a thing that's going to compete with the US cement

01:09:22 producers. I think the same is true for steel.

01:09:25 There's overcapacity in the steel sector.

01:09:27 There's overcapacity in the flat glass sector and homewares, you know, fridges

01:09:31 paint all these kinds of things. It goes into housing.

01:09:33 Some of that can be exported like steel. And when you see you are seeing a big

01:09:37 ramp up in steel exports in the first few months of the year, some of that

01:09:40 can't be exported. You know, if you want to look at the car

01:09:44 sector, though, there has been a massive increase in Chinese car exports.

01:09:48 A lot of that's actually all the vehicles, you know, the petrol and

01:09:51 diesel driven cars, which are a lot of that's going to Russia, replacing

01:09:56 Japanese and Western cars which are no longer being exported to Russia because

01:09:59 of the, you know, the sanctions on Russian companies.

01:10:02 If you look at EVs, though, which is what everyone talks about when they're

01:10:05 talking about, I think one of the things everyone talks about when they talk

01:10:07 about overcapacity, it doesn't look like China has massive overcapacity right

01:10:11 now. Most of the EVs that are being produced

01:10:13 here or are still being sold in China and the ones that are being exported are

01:10:17 being exported at prices much higher than they would be in China.

01:10:20 So there doesn't seem to be a massive oversupply of EVs that has to be

01:10:24 exported overseas. And the ones that are being exported

01:10:26 aren't being dumped at this point. So it really depends on what kind of

01:10:30 sector you want to talk about. I think the really good sector, which

01:10:32 does show massive overcapacity being exported out, is solar panels.

01:10:36 But at this point, China produces almost all the world's solar panels and they're

01:10:40 not really driving other companies out of business.

01:10:42 There's almost no foreign solar panel manufacturers left because over the last

01:10:46 ten years, Chinese subsidies and capacity have driven them out of

01:10:49 business. And so now what's going to happen is

01:10:51 that Chinese solar panel manufacturers are going to struggle because their

01:10:54 prices have collapsed and they're struggling to make a profit.

01:10:58 But the rest of world is getting cheaper.

01:10:59 Solar panels. So what can we what do we knowing about

01:11:04 this trip that the Yellen's going to make in Beijing, then?

01:11:07 I mean, how can she address this problem?

01:11:09 I know she has in the past, but what could really come out of this trip?

01:11:15 You're going to see her talk, I think more about these kinds of issues.

01:11:18 He has raised overcapacity questions, but she hasn't really been specific on

01:11:22 what sectors we're talking about or if there is specific sectors that she

01:11:25 actually raises with the Chinese side. That may be something they will like to

01:11:28 hear. You did see in the work report that came

01:11:30 out last month that the Chinese themselves are talking about

01:11:32 overcapacity in specific in some sectors without any details.

01:11:36 So she can talk to those specific things.

01:11:38 And they also have concerns about there may be some room for negotiation there

01:11:43 or discussion. But, you know, China hasn't the

01:11:48 government doesn't seem to really accept these claims from the EU or the US that

01:11:52 they are suffering from mass overcapacity, and that is a threat to

01:11:55 other countries. So if it just becomes like a parallel

01:11:58 dispute of like of the US saying you have overcapacity and the Chinese

01:12:01 saying, yeah, we do, but it's not your problem.

01:12:04 It's unclear if they are going to be ready sort of real resolution or sort of

01:12:08 real solutions put forward from this meeting.

01:12:11 But obviously that's one of the issues that's going to be discussed.

01:12:13 I think fentanyl will be another issue that will be discussed.

01:12:15 And obviously, China U.S. expects China to do more about stopping

01:12:18 the flow of chemicals from fentanyl. And there is also discussions to be had

01:12:22 on debt relief for other countries, the IMF for negotiations and other things.

01:12:26 So I think they seem does seem to be a lot of things are on the table.

01:12:29 Of those overcapacity is just one of them.

01:12:33 James, thank you. James Baker, there are China economy

01:12:35 editor joining us out of Beijing. Some other stories that we're tracking

01:12:38 for you this morning. President Biden says Israel has not done

01:12:42 enough to protect civilians in Gaza after airstrikes killed seven aid

01:12:46 workers. Among the dead are British, Australian,

01:12:49 Polish and Canadian American volunteers with the World Central Kitchen charity.

01:12:54 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu admitted what he called an

01:12:57 unintended strike on innocent people. It's prompted several charities to

01:13:02 suspend food deliveries to Palestinians who the UN and EU say are on the brink

01:13:07 of starvation. Iran's supreme leader has promised to

01:13:11 take revenge on Israel after a deadly airstrike on its embassy in Syria.

01:13:15 State media quoted Ayatollah Ali Khamenei saying that Israel will regret

01:13:20 its crime. Israel has not confirmed it was behind

01:13:23 the strike in Damascus, which Tehran says destroyed its council IT building

01:13:28 and killed at least 13 people, including seven Iranian military personnel.

01:13:33 NAITO is said to be proposing a fund of allied contributions for Ukraine worth

01:13:37 $100 billion over five years. Sources say it's part of a package.

01:13:42 Alliance leaders would need to sign off on when they gather in Washington in

01:13:46 July. The proposal could also see NATO's take

01:13:48 charge of weapons deliveries to Ukraine amid European concern that a second

01:13:53 Trump presidency could change U.S. policy.

01:13:57 Most of the clients across these equity markets Hang Seng Tech Index.

01:14:00 In terms of market breadth, a lot of negativity coming through led by the

01:14:04 pullback we're seeing in EVs. Volumes are flat as far as Chinese

01:14:07 markets go. As far as the rest region goes, is

01:14:10 certainly a page of risk aversion out there with the exception of utilities.

01:14:16 And I guess for reasons that are fairly obvious when you look at where the oil

01:14:19 price is, with the exception of energy prices and the energy sector, most other

01:14:24 sectors are actually pushing lower as well.

01:14:25 Just about across the region. I should mention, Taiwan is coming off

01:14:29 low as of today. We're down, down only 6/10 of 1%.

01:14:32 We were hovering around that -1% about 20 minutes back or so.

01:14:37 Right. Plenty more ahead.

01:14:38 This is while this is Bloomberg.

01:14:50 Welcome back. If you're watching the The China show,

01:14:52 more on the what we're seeing as far as some of the commentary coming through at

01:14:57 a time when for Taiwanese corporates here what they've done so far given the

01:15:01 strongest quake in 25 years, TSMC and its closest rival UMC, have both said

01:15:06 that they have evacuated factory areas after that earthquake that rocked

01:15:10 Taiwan, endangering production at the world's largest maker of advanced chips.

01:15:15 Let's get a sense really of the potential scale or not on this properly

01:15:20 is with us here on set to talk us through this.

01:15:22 Bloomberg intelligence, senior analyst, We're all yours.

01:15:27 Okay. Thank you very much for that, for the

01:15:29 build up. This is clearly a large earthquake, both

01:15:32 in historical terms and in absolute terms.

01:15:35 So 7.3, you know, over seven, I mean, that's a big quake.

01:15:39 However, the epicenter is something like 18 kilometres south of a place called

01:15:44 Hualien, which is in a less densely populated area of the island on the East

01:15:48 Coast. So whilst obviously the first concern is

01:15:51 for the people who live in that area and if some of the initial images are

01:15:55 obviously quite concerning with buildings, you know, tilting to one side

01:15:59 at sharp angles, etc., however sort of tying into the, you know, potential

01:16:04 impact to TSMC and some of the tech companies on the island, the majority of

01:16:08 the science parks and industrial parks are on the other side.

01:16:12 So on the west coast of the island. Yeah.

01:16:15 So whilst there will still the quakes will obviously be felt there.

01:16:20 And again, we don't have the data on this at the moment, but there will be

01:16:24 some disruption because the epicenter of this quake is

01:16:28 some geographical distance from Shinjuku Science Park.

01:16:32 Then at the moment, whilst there may well be some disruption, the risk of

01:16:37 major issues at TSMC and its peers is probably less likely.

01:16:42 I would say that is a sensible, logical initial view.

01:16:45 Well, you know, Taiwan is prone to quakes.

01:16:47 I mean, these factories are pretty quake proof too, in some ways.

01:16:50 Robert Yeah, they're designed to be as earthquake proof as they can in terms of

01:16:54 putting rubber buffers under them to reduce any shaking and disruption.

01:16:58 But as you saw, TSMC updated people to say that production was immediately shut

01:17:04 down, the buildings were evacuated. So there are very well planned

01:17:09 protocols, etc., and procedures in place for such an event.

01:17:12 I'm being on the ring of fire. Earthquakes are, you know, occur quite

01:17:16 regularly in Taiwan, perhaps not to this magnitude.

01:17:19 So I think the risk is disruption to TSMC.

01:17:23 It's hard to say how long that may be, but because the epicenters

01:17:26 geographically distance, I mean, that's mitigated.

01:17:30 We have a few more details coming through from TSMC.

01:17:32 The company now saying that they have suspended construction on new sites

01:17:36 across Taiwan and they have halted some chip making machines as a preventative

01:17:42 measure as and as we've been talking about.

01:17:43 Robert to Robert about this is more about preventative measures being more

01:17:47 cautious more than anything right now, more coming through here.

01:17:49 The spokeswoman, Nina Cao, also saying by phone that all TSMC staff are safe as

01:17:56 well. We were having this conversation

01:17:58 earlier. Robert, if you get more context to this

01:18:00 preventative, it's hard to imagine, despite the very

01:18:05 low probability this is going to cause major disruptions, that maybe today is

01:18:09 going to be anything but normal. Can the system handle one or two days of

01:18:13 disruptions? I guess, yeah.

01:18:15 I mean, every chip is different, but it can take between days, two, many weeks

01:18:19 of production steps depending on the complexity of the chip.

01:18:22 So to lose one or days to two days production, I mean, is is, is is

01:18:28 troublesome, but you know, it's not a game changer.

01:18:31 So we'll have to wait and see. But just sort of thinking about the

01:18:33 larger sort of challenge, I mean, I focus my comments very much on TSMC fab

01:18:37 being state of the art, earthquake proof, etc..

01:18:40 But then what about the infrastructure in the areas?

01:18:43 You know, if people can't physically get in to work because the roads disrupted,

01:18:46 if the trains are not running, you know, if the buildings that they live in are

01:18:50 affected, I think there's potential for a wider impact there perhaps, and that

01:18:54 will become more clear as the day wears on, I guess.

01:18:58 Okay, Robert, thank you so much.

01:19:01 Robert Lee there on TSMC and the potential fallout here.

01:19:05 We should also just mention as well that US futures are actually down.

01:19:09 We should be at session lows. In fact, when that quake initially hit.

01:19:11 That's going to come up on your screens right now.

01:19:13 You did see that dip in US futures, although it's a seven points.

01:19:17 Right. We're also seeing this play out across

01:19:18 other chip stocks across the region. You mentioned behind you ask you guys,

01:19:22 is that as much as close to 4%? Samsung in Seoul also down some 1%.

01:19:26 So you're feeling a little bit more of that spillover effect when it comes to

01:19:30 some of the chip makers across the region.

01:19:31 But again, is it just kind of a knee jerk reaction right now?

01:19:34 That certainly is what it seems like it could be.

01:19:36 But we're tracking some other stories out there in the corporate world as

01:19:39 well. The U.S.

01:19:40 is said to be asking South Korea to adopt restrictions on chip technology

01:19:44 exports to China in line with Washington's controls.

01:19:48 Our sources are saying that. Officials want Seoul to tighten the flow

01:19:50 of technology used for making high end logic and memory chips.

01:19:55 The U.S. reportedly discussed the topic and

01:19:57 dubbed with Korea's president in March. But Seoul is still debating the request

01:20:01 as China is a key trading partner. Intel says it's what you you're

01:20:05 factoring operation losses of deep end and the business may not reach a break

01:20:09 even point for several years. Intel Foundry, a new division of the

01:20:13 company responsible for manufacturing, had sales of nearly $19 billion in 2023.

01:20:18 That's down from 28 billion the previous year.

01:20:21 The company's shares fell in extended trading after disclosing those numbers

01:20:26 in. A new poll suggest China has dethroned

01:20:28 the U.S. to become the top alignment choice for

01:20:31 Southeast Asia. The survey of just under 2000 people by

01:20:34 Singapore's ICAC, Yousef Ishak Institute, saw that China's popularity

01:20:39 climbing to just over 50%. The report says waning confidence in the

01:20:44 U.S. could be attributed in part to insights

01:20:47 about Washington's strategic and political influence.

01:20:51 Meanwhile, we're talking about shares of Rivian Automotive slipped in New York

01:20:55 despite building and delivering more EVs last quarter than estimated.

01:20:59 But the firm failed to soothe investor concerns about the sector after standing

01:21:03 by its 2024 output target of about 57,000 units.

01:21:08 Rivian has had a rocky start to the year marked by job cuts and a decline in its

01:21:12 market value. Breaking news concerning Disney breaking

01:21:15 news out of Reuters. To be more specific here, it looks like

01:21:18 this costly monthslong proxy battle might be tilting in favor of Disney.

01:21:23 It does. Just looking at the headline coming

01:21:26 through, the Disney has has gotten enough votes passed and Disney gets

01:21:31 enough votes to win this proxy fight, of course, with Trian fund management.

01:21:36 That's according to Reuters as we speak. Then we got more details on this story,

01:21:41 plus plenty more ahead, including, of course, the big market moves.

01:21:45 Big themes crossing these markets as we sort of make our way into midday on this

01:21:49 midweek session. There's just one word.

01:22:03 Welcome back to show an update here further opted out of Taiwan.

01:22:08 Taiwan says no flights were affected by the earthquake, which hit nearly 3 hours

01:22:13 back where the stronger strongest one in 25 years.

01:22:16 In case you're just joining us as well, just a few more updates coming through

01:22:19 in the last 30 minutes because these headlines are coming through.

01:22:23 This concerns TSMC. A spokesperson for the firm says all

01:22:27 staff are safe. They have halted some chip making

01:22:29 machines as a prevention measure. At this point in time.

01:22:34 They have suspended all construction and all new sites across Taiwan at this

01:22:38 point in time, according to CNA. Separately, Taiwan Metro has resumed

01:22:42 operation this hour as well, but the latest one coming through.

01:22:45 No flights were affected or are affected by this earthquake.

01:22:50 Yeah, okay. So at least we're hearing that flights

01:22:52 were not affected. Metro also has resume operation, at

01:22:55 least in the capital of Taipei. So certainly it is slowly coming back to

01:23:00 business as usual for some parts of the island.

01:23:03 Let's switch gears now and talk a bit more about some of the companies that

01:23:07 we've been tracking, in particular when it comes to our Bloomberg intelligence

01:23:09 team. So I think back in January, they had a

01:23:11 list of 50 companies to watch. They've narrowed it down now to just ten

01:23:16 this quarter. Still to make it simple for all of us

01:23:19 here and really looking through some of the good apples among the bunch there.

01:23:23 Among them is one here in Asia. That's the one on the second one on the

01:23:27 top panel there, child type folk. Let's bring in our senior analyst for

01:23:31 Bloomberg Intelligence, Kathryn Lim, joining us now to walk us through let's

01:23:34 let's talk about shortfall. First of all.

01:23:35 Why is that on your radar, Catherine? Well, Yvonne, David, you know, you guys

01:23:41 are in Hong Kong, so you would have actually heard over the weekend or maybe

01:23:45 been to Shenzhen yourself over the weekend that, you know, we are seeing an

01:23:49 exodus of residents and a shift in spending, you know, to China instead of

01:23:55 Hong Kong. And if you look at the initial numbers

01:23:58 from the first three days itself, a 76% year on year increase in exodus of Hong

01:24:05 Kong residents to China and just about a 35% inbound traffic from China into Hong

01:24:12 Kong itself. So, you know, there's a very high

01:24:14 likelihood that, you know, it's not going to be a pretty much retail sales

01:24:19 in Hong Kong and how this effort foot really plays into this.

01:24:22 Now, this is one of the most followed jewelry in Hong Kong itself.

01:24:27 The good news is that, you know, the company has shifted bulk of its business

01:24:31 to Hong Kong, but there is still a proportion in Hong Kong, you know,

01:24:35 whereby sorry, they shipped about to China and a still a good portion in Hong

01:24:39 Kong. So they may not actually see as great

01:24:42 sales. Do you know in the Hong Kong retail

01:24:45 market whereby rents are actually still high.

01:24:49 Okay, well, round up. So we have nine more to choose from.

01:24:54 Some, of course. Ah, but ah, I have to say of course,

01:24:57 outside of the Asia Pacific. But yeah, let's take, take your pick.

01:24:59 What else you want to talk about here among the nine.

01:25:02 Sure. You know what, A bit out of the tent.

01:25:05 We have three coming out of Asia. One of them would be key financials,

01:25:11 China's second largest broker. But perhaps, you know, the last one,

01:25:14 Tencent itself is something that, you know, everyone still has your eyes don't

01:25:18 do, you know, on a gaming side of the market and on a relative basis, we've

01:25:22 seen all that, you know, bust and, you know, chaos that's going on in Alibaba.

01:25:28 If I can actually put it this way, I think what my colleague is actually

01:25:31 still positive on the stock up, particularly on the online gaming

01:25:34 sector. Catherine, thank you so much.

01:25:38 Catherine Lam joining us. I can't keep track of where you are,

01:25:41 really. I just saw at the office a few days in

01:25:43 Tokyo. Now you're in Tokyo.

01:25:45 Are you still based in Singapore? I think you are.

01:25:46 Okay. So we can take this conversation off

01:25:48 line. Yeah.

01:25:49 And following. Yeah.

01:25:54 Let's take it offline. Okay.

01:25:55 Catherine in Tokyo for us.

01:25:58 The Treasury yield is looking like this, a reversal of the move we've seen in

01:26:01 recent days where that long dated yields have actually been pushing higher.

01:26:04 It's the opposite.
