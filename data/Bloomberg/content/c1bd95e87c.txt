Donald Trump plans to host Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida next week, a move thatâ€™s likely to fuel anxiety among US allies about the prospect of the former president returning to power.

The meeting is expected to take place March 8, according to a person familiar with the plans who spoke on condition of anonymity. Orban, like Trump, has espoused populist policies and holds a prominent position as a leader of the far-right resurgence in Europe.
