Ron DeSantis closest allies are taking greater control over the daily operations of his presidential run, another shakeup in the Florida governor’s 2024 bid just weeks before the first Republican nominating contest.

Scott Wagner, one of DeSantis’ oldest friends from their time at Yale and a lawyer in Miami, assumed leadership last weekend of the allied super political action committee, Never Back Down. That group has been effectively running DeSantis’ operation in Iowa.
