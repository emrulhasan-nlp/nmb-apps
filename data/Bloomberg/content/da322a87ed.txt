Democratic victories in Kentucky and Virginia, and an abortion rights landslide in Ohio, where voters enshrined the right to choose in the state constitution, were the big news from Tuesday’s election. But election results in Pennsylvania were arguably just as telling.

Last week’s New York Times/Siena poll showed Donald Trump leading Joe Biden by 4 points in Pennsylvania, which Trump won narrowly in 2016 before it flipped to Biden in 2020. Pennsylvania has an older population than most states, and a vast conservative swath of terrain known as “Pennsyl-tucky.” Or, as a line attributed to Democratic consultant James Carville has it, “Pennsylvania is Philadelphia and Pittsburgh with Alabama in between.”
