00:12 >> FROM THE WORLD OF POLITICS OF THE WORLD OF BUSINESS, THIS

00:14 IS BALANCE OF POWER.

00:26 LIVE FROM WASHINGTON, D.C.

00:30 >> FROM BLOOMBERG'S WASHINGTON, D.C. STUDIO TO OUR TV AUDIENCES

00:36 WORLDWIDE, WELCOME TO BALANCE OF POWER.

00:37 ALONGSIDE KAILEY LEINZ, AND JOE MATHIEU.

00:43 >> FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP HOLDS A LONG LEAD IN POLLS. JOE:

00:48 CONGRESS WITH NEW HOPES FOR A DEAL TO AVOID A GOVERNMENT

00:49 SHUTDOWN LATER THIS MONTH. WE WILL TALK IT OUT WITH

00:53 CONGRESSMAN FRENCH HILL OF ARKANSAS. KAILEY:

00:57 FROM THOSE DOMESTIC POLITICAL ISSUES TO GEOPOLITICS, WHAT ARE

00:59 THE BIGGEST RISKS THE WORLD FACES THIS YEAR?

01:02 EURASIA GROUP IS OUT WITH ITS LIST AND ITS CHAIRMAN IS WITH

01:07 US. MUCH TO DISCUSS, NOTEWORTHY ON

01:10 THE TOP OF EURASIA'S LIST, THE NUMBER ONE RISK IS THE UNITED

01:14 STATES VERSUS ITSELF AND THAT JUST SPEAKS TO THE GRAVITY OF

01:16 THE ELECTION YEAR THAT REALLY WE ARE NOW ENTERING. JOE:

01:20 WE HAVE ONE WEEK TO GO. 12 DEGREES BELOW ZERO I THINK

01:22 IS THE FORECAST FOR IOWA. A WEEK FROM TODAY WHEN VOTERS

01:28 WILL ACTUALLY BEGIN THE PROCESS. WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

01:32 POLLS FOR MONTHS NOW AND WE HAVE VOTERS AND CAUCUS SITES

01:36 MAKING DECISIONS IN ONE WEEK WHICH WILL MAKE FOR A BUSY WEEK

01:37 NOT ONLY IN WASHINGTON BUT OF COURSE ON THE TRAIL. KAILEY:

01:40 WE WILL BE THERE TO COVER IT FURTHER WITH SPECIAL COVERAGE

01:44 FROM DES MOINES. WE ARE JOINED BY OUR WONDERFUL

01:47 BLOOMBERG'S JOSH WINGROVE AND NANCY WHO COVER THE WHITE HOUSE

01:51 AND NATIONAL POLITICS FOR US. TO BEGIN WITH YOU, ONE WEEK

01:56 OUT, TRUMP IS POLLING CONSISTENTLY AROUND 50%,

01:57 PERHAPS EVEN NORTH OF IT. IT SEEMS ALL BUT GUARANTEED

02:02 THAT HE IS GOING TO WIN IOWA. I GUESS THE QUESTION IS HOW

02:05 MUCH DOES HE NEED TO WIN BY TO CEMENT THE IDEA THAT HE IS

02:06 EVENTUALLY GOING TO BE THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE?

02:11 >> HIS CAMPAIGN HAS TRIED TO PROJECT THIS AIR OF

02:16 INVINCIBILITY AND WE HAVE SEEN THAT IN THE POLLS.

02:20 I THINK THERE IS A CONCERN PRIVATELY AMONG TRUMP CAMPAIGN

02:21 OFFICIALS, YOU KNOW, THEY WANT HIM TO HAVE A BLOWOUT WIN, THEY

02:27 WANT HIM TO KNOCK RON DESANTIS OFF THE BALLOT.

02:29 THEY WANT TO SHOW THEY ARE DOMINANT OVER NIKKI HALEY.

02:34 THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM WIN BY AS WIDE A MARGIN AS POSSIBLE.

02:37 THERE ARE TWO FACTORS COMPLICATING THAT.

02:39 ONE, WE TALKED ABOUT THE WEATHER IN IOWA.

02:42 ONE WEEK FROM TONIGHT IS SUPPOSED TO BE SUPERCOLD.

02:45 CAUCUSES START AT 7:00 AT NIGHT TWO HOURS AFTER ITS DARK.

02:50 YOU ARE ASKING PEOPLE TO LEAVE THEIR COZY HOUSE AFTER DINNER

02:54 AND GO TO THESE PRECINCTS IN SNOWY IOWA.

02:57 THE SECOND THING IS TRUMP HAS A LARGE NUMBER OF FIRST-TIME

02:59 CAUCUS-GOERS WHO ARE SUPPORTERS SO I THINK THAT THERE IS A

03:02 CONCERN AMONG TRUMP SUPPORTERS THAT SOME OF THESE PEOPLE WILL

03:06 SEE THE POLLS AND SAY MY GUY IS SO FAR AHEAD, I DON'T NEED TO

03:09 LEAVE MY HOUSE AND SUPPORT HIM BUT THEY REALLY WANT HIM TO WIN

03:10 BY A WIDE MARGIN. JOE: POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS.

03:16 ALL THE WHILE, JOE BIDEN IS OF COURSE DOING THE ROSE GARDEN

03:19 STRATEGY EVEN IF IT IS A BIG HOLE TO BE IN THE ROSE GARDEN.

03:24 HE GOT ON THE ROAD AND SPOKE AT MANUAL EPISCOPAL CHURCH IN

03:28 CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINE A HE IS.

03:32 >> -- SOUTH CAROLINA. HERE HE IS.

03:35 >> YOUR VOICE WAS HEARD. SHAPING YOUR DESTINY.

03:39 THAT IS DEMOCRACY. I AM PROUD TO HAVE LED THE

03:45 EFFORT TO MAKE SURE YOUR VOICE AND SOUTH CAROLINA'S VOICE WILL

03:48 ALWAYS BE HEARD BECAUSE NOW YOU ARE FIRST IN THE PRIMARY. JOE:

03:56 HE REMEMBERS SOUTH CAROLINA QUITE FONDLY FROM THE LAST

03:57 CAMPAIGN. THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

04:02 ROLE SOUTH CAROLINA COULD PLAY ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE WITH

04:04 NIKKI HALEY COMING BACK TO HER HOME STATE.

04:07 SHE IS DONALD TRUMP BY A LOT. THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF

04:11 CONCERNS ABOUT JOE BIDEN LOSING PROGRESSIVES, LOSING BLACK

04:12 VOTERS WHO BROUGHT HIM INTO OFFICE TO BEGIN WITH.

04:17 DISCONTENT OVER A NUMBER OF ISSUES INCLUDING MOST RECENTLY

04:19 THE SITUATION IN ISRAEL. HOW IMPORTANT IS THAT TRIP AND

04:20 OTHERS LIKE IT FOR HIM?

04:23 >> THIS TRIP IS AIMED AT

04:29 SHORING UP SOME -- SUPPORT AMONGST BLACK VOTERS.

04:32 TODAY, WE SAW SOME OF THOSE TENSIONS COME TO A HEAD.

04:34 THERE WAS A PROTEST IN THE CHURCH, PEOPLE CALLING FOR A

04:37 CEASE-FIRE AND THEN BEING SHOUTED OVER BY CONGREGANTS AT

04:40 THE CHURCH WHO ARE SHOUTING FOR FOUR MORE YEARS AND BITE IN IS

04:43 VERY MUCH OF THE MIND ALWAYS THAT HE SORT OF, YOU KNOW,

04:45 DANCES WITH THE ONE THAT BROUGHT HIM TO THE BALL AND

04:50 THAT IS WHY YOU WILL SEE OUTREACH TO MINORITY

04:51 COMMUNITIES, IN PARTICULAR THE BLACK COMMUNITY, AND THAT WILL

04:52 KEEP GOING. HE HAS ALSO BEEN ASKED ABOUT

04:54 HIS OWN PRIMARY. COULD HE GET LOWER-THAN-EXPECTED TOTALS IN

05:00 SOME OF THESE AND COULD SUDDENLY THIS FLEDGLING

05:03 WHISPERS OF DEAN PHILIP'S OR WHATEVER CHALLENGER, COULD

05:05 THERE BE SOME GAS ON THE FIRE ON THAT? THEY DOWNPLAYED THAT.

05:09 THEY DON'T SEEM THAT CONCERNED ABOUT THAT.

05:11 WHAT THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT GENERALLY IS BLACK SUPPORT,

05:14 BLACK TURNOUT, NOT NECESSARILY IN THE GENERAL ELECTION BUT IN

05:19 SWING STATES WITH BIG BLACK POPULATIONS, MAKING SURE THEY

05:21 ARE NOT LOSING TOUCH WITH THOSE COMMUNITIES.

05:23 WE WILL SEE HIM ON THE ROAD A LOT.

05:26 WE WILL SEE KAMALA HARRIS ON THE ROAD A LOT AND MAKE SURE

05:31 THEY SHORE UP THOSE CONSTITUENCIES AMONG SOME

05:33 COHORTS THAT MADE UP THE BIDEN ELECTION.

05:35 THE ONE PERSON THAT HAS DECIDED WHO HE THINK IS WINNING IOWA,

05:40 JOE BIDEN HAD DECIDED DONALD TRUMP HAS WON IOWA ALREADY.

05:42 HE IS JUMPING THE GUN ON THAT SO WE WILL SEE WHERE THAT GOES

05:47 BUT RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON THAT TRUMP CONTRAST,

05:51 TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER THAT SORT OF HUMPTY DUMPTY COALITION

05:55 THAT BIDEN SCRAPED BY WITH 2020. >> ONE OF THE ISSUES HE IS

06:00 FACING, NOT JUST IN TERMS OF HIS HANDLING OF THE CONFLICT IN

06:05 PALESTINE IS SOMETHING HERE AT HOME.

06:07 THE ECONOMY ON THE ONE HAND BUT BORDER SECURITY ON THE OTHER

06:08 HAND. AND KNOWING THAT THE WHITE HOUSE ACTIVELY IS NEGOTIATING

06:12 WITH THE SENATE AT LEAST TO THIS POINT FOR BORDER SECURITY.

06:17 HOW BADLY DOES BIDEN NOT JUST AS A PRESIDENT BUT AS A

06:19 CANDIDATE NEED TO BE SEEN DOING SOME THING ABOUT THAT?

06:26 >> HE INDICATES HOW THE SITUATION HAS CHANGED.

06:28 DEMOCRATS SEEM TO BE ENTERTAINING BORDER MEASURES

06:29 THAT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE ENTERTAINED ALL THAT LONG AGO

06:33 AND THEY REALLY HAVE NO CHOICE. THE REPUBLICANS WERE

06:36 NEGOTIATING THIS IN A PRETTY STRONG POSITION.

06:39 WE DON'T KNOW YET HOW THIS WILL TAKE SHAPE, IF IT WILL TAKE

06:43 SHAPE, BUT BIDEN HAS TRIED TO MINIMIZE THE BORDER.

06:44 HE HAS BEEN THERE BRIEFLY. EARLIER ON, IT WAS KAMALA

06:48 HARRIS'S RESPONSIBILITY. NOT SO MUCH ANYMORE.

06:53 SO THIS HAS JUST BEEN A BUILDING ISSUE AND PARTICULAR

06:57 PRESSURE IS BUILDING AMONG DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS AND MAYORS

07:00 WHO ARE SEEING MIGRANTS COME TO THEIR COMMUNITIES WITHOUT THE

07:02 RESOURCES TO HELP SETTLE PEOPLE IN A HUMANE WAY OR WATER LEEWAY.

07:07 SO THIS IS JUST A GROWING PROBLEM FOR THEM SO THAT IS WHY

07:09 THEY ARE SETTING AT THE TABLE, TALKING ABOUT A DEAL THAT NOT

07:11 THAT LONG AGO THAT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE CONSIDERED OR WOULD

07:13 NOT HAVE CONSIDERED FOR LONG. JOE:

07:17 INTERESTING POLLING FROM CBS NEWS SPECIFIC TO THE BORDER AND

07:21 PRESIDENT BIDEN, 63% AGREE THE PRESIDENT SHOULD BE TOUGHER ON

07:24 THE BORDER AND AS WE WAIT FOR A POTENTIAL DEAL TO EMERGE AS

07:27 SOON AS THIS WEEK, THIS IS A QUESTION OF DONALD TRUMP.

07:30 I WONDER WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THIS, KNOWING SPEAKER JOHNSON

07:34 IS IN CONSTANT CONTACT REGULAR CONTACT WITH THE FORMER

07:37 PRESIDENT. WHY WOULD DONALD TRUMP ENFORCE

07:40 A DEAL ON THE BORDER THAT WOULD CLEARLY HELP JOE BIDEN?

07:44 >> HE IS PROBABLY LOOKING AT THE LONG GAME.

07:46 IT IS NOT GOOD FOR REPUBLICANS AT THIS POINT TO APPEAR

07:48 COMPLETELY DYSFUNCTIONAL ON THE HOUSE AND UNABLE TO GOVERN IN

07:51 AN ELECTION YEAR. THAT REALLY HURTS THEIR

07:53 PROSPECTS ON THE BALLOT FOR THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE.

07:56 IT DOES SEEM LIKE REPUBLICANS WILL BE ABLE TO RECAPTURE THE

08:02 SENATE SO I THINK THAT THEY ARE LOOKING AT IT STRATEGICALLY.

08:03 YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN THIS TIME AROUND IS

08:09 VERY ORGANIZED AND VERY PROFESSIONAL, UNLIKE THE WAY

08:11 HIS WHITE HOUSE OPERATED SO I THINK THAT THEY ARE MUCH BETTER

08:14 AT SORT OF LOOKING STRATEGICALLY AT THE LONG TERM.

08:17 KAILEY: YOU TALK ABOUT ORGANIZATION

08:19 WITHIN A WHITE HOUSE. JOSH, THERE'S A LOT OF

08:23 QUESTIONS TODAY REALLY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS ABOUT

08:24 ORGANIZED COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE

08:29 PENTAGON AFTER NEWS CAME OUT THAT THE SECRETARY, LLOYD

08:31 AUSTIN, ESSENTIALLY WAS HOSPITALIZED ON NEW YEAR'S DAY

08:35 AND IT WAS DAYS BEFORE THE WHITE HOUSE KNEW ABOUT IT.

08:38 HOW COULD THAT POSSIBLY HAVE HAPPENED?

08:41 DOES THAT INDICATE THAT FRANKLY, THE SECRETARY OF

08:42 DEFENSE AND THE PRESIDENT FOR ALL OF THE DIFFERENT CONFLICTS

08:45 GOING ON IN THE WORLD DON'T ACTUALLY TALK TO EACH OTHER

08:46 THAT MUCH? JOSH: THIS IS A QUESTION EVERYONE IS

08:49 ASKING. HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN? THE ADMINISTRATION IS PRETTY

08:55 QUICK TO SORT OF THROW THE DOD UNDER THE BUS A LITTLE BIT

08:57 HERE, SAYING WE DIDN'T KNOW. IT WAS DAYS -- JAKE SULLIVAN

09:03 DID NOT KNOW UNTIL ABOUT THURSDAY, IF MEMORY SERVES, SO

09:05 THEY SORT OF KIND OF CONCEITED THAT THIS WAS A MISTAKE --

09:10 CONCEDED THAT THIS WAS A MISTAKE.

09:14 THE WHITE HOUSE IS ON THE FLIP SIDE OF IT BEING THOSE, SAYING

09:19 NOT ONLY DO THEY NOT EXPECT IT BUT THERE IS A REPORT IN

09:22 POLITICO THAT HE WOULD DENY IT AND DECLINED THE OFFER.

09:26 LLOYD AUSTIN WILL BE AROUND FOR A WHILE.

09:29 THAT IS NOT GOING TO BE -- PARTICULARLY WITH EVERYTHING

09:34 GOING ON. WE DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT THE

09:39 CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS HEALTH SITUATION.

09:44 IT SEEMS TO BE AN ELECTIVE SITUATION, NOT LIFE-THREATENING.

09:49 HOW IS IT THAT THERE WASN'T A MIDDLE GAP SCENARIO TO ADDRESS

09:51 HIS ABSENCE?

09:54 >> IT IS PRETTY REMARKABLE. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS THAT

09:57 BROUGHT HIM TO THE HOSPITAL OR WHAT IT WAS BEYOND SEVERE PAIN

09:58 THAT BROUGHT HIM BACK. THERE WAS AN ON THE RECORD

10:02 OFF-CAMERA BRIEFING AT THE PENTAGON TODAY AND WE LEARNED

10:06 ESSENTIALLY NOTHING NEW SINCE THIS MORNING SO WE WILL KEEP

10:07 YOU POSTED OF COURSE ON THE SECRETARY'S CONDITION.

10:11 THINGS TO JOSH WINGROVE AND NANCY COOK, WITH US AT OUR

10:14 BLOOMBERG ROUNDTABLE. AS CONGRESS BEGINS TO RETURN TO

10:18 WASHINGTON, WE WILL TALK THE MANY HURDLES IN THEIR WAY WITH

10:21 CONGRESSMAN FRENCH HELLO ARKANSAS.

10:23 HE IS NEXT WITH US ON BALANCE ON BLOOMBERG TV.

10:40 >> YOU HAVE GOT TO NOTICE HOW ANGRY THE FAR RIGHT FLANK OF

10:46 THE HOUSE GOP IS THIS MORNING. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE

10:52 SPEAKER, SPEAKER JOHNSON, IS OPERATING WITH NO ROOM FOR

10:56 ERROR AND HE WON'T ALMOST CERTAINLY NEED DEMOCRATIC

10:57 SUPPORT TO PASS HIS BILL. THAT IS SOMETHING FORMER

11:01 SPEAKER MCCARTHY DID NOT WANT TO DO, ENDED UP DOING, AND THEN

11:03 GOT THROWN OUT FROM THE SPEAKERSHIP.

11:11 JOE: REFLECTING ON THE HEADACHES FACING SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON AND

11:17 PASSING A BUDGET AND HIS REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE.

11:19 THERE IS SOME NEWS THERE. JOINING US TO TALK ABOUT IT,

11:23 CONGRESSMAN FRENCH HILL OF ARKANSAS. WELCOME BACK.

11:25 HAPPY NEW YEAR, IF IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO SAY THAT.

11:27 I KNOW WE ARE ONE WEEK OUT.

11:33 APPARENTLY, -- THANK YOU, SIR. AGREED TO TOPLINE SPENDING

11:38 LEVELS FOR THE BUDGETING PROCESS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR.

11:41 I AM A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED, CONGRESSMAN, BECAUSE IT IS THE

11:46 SAME TOPLINE LEVEL AGREED TO IN THE DEBT CEILING DEAL GOING

11:49 BACK TO JUNE, SO DID WE JUST WASTE ALL THAT TIME?

11:53 >> I WISH IT WAS JUNE. I WISH IT WAS WARM AND SUNNY

11:57 OUTSIDE BUT IT IS COLD AND RAINY HERE IN LITTLE ROCK AND

11:58 YOU ARE EXACTLY RIGHT. WE ARE EXACTLY WHERE WE WERE IN

12:05 JUNE WHICH IS A FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY ACT LEVEL OF

12:06 SPENDING THAT ASSURES THE PROPER DEFENSE BUDGET, TAKES US

12:13 BACK TO NONDEFENSE, NON-V.A. SPENDING, BACK TO FY 19 LEVELS,

12:20 AND SPEAKER JOHNSON DID ADD SOME ADDITIONAL WINDS FOR THE

12:21 REPUBLICAN SIDE OF THE AISLE THIS WEEK BECAUSE HE WAS ABLE

12:26 TO CLAW BACK OVER $20 BILLION OF ADDITIONAL SPENDING IN BOTH

12:32 COVERT SPENDING AND THAT IRS BUDGET FOR INCREASING THEIR

12:36 STAFF SO WE ARE BACK THERE. THINK OF ALL THE THINGS THAT WE

12:38 COULD HAVE GOTTEN DONE. WE WOULD HAVE HAD SPENDING

12:41 BEHIND US. WE WOULD HAVE SPEAKER KEVIN

12:44 MCCARTHY. I AM GLAD WE ARE HERE AND I

12:47 HOPE THAT CAN LET US GET A DEAL DONE AND DONE QUICKLY. KAILEY:

12:53 CONGRESSMAN, YOU SPEAK OF SOME WINDS THAT MIKE JOHNSON IS

12:57 TOUTING NOW AND IT DOESN'T SEEM AS IF EVERYONE IS SATISFIED.

13:01 THE CREED THEM -- THE FREEDOM CAUCUS SAID THIS DEAL IS WORSE

13:02 THAN THEY THOUGHT. WHAT IS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT

13:05 THIS CONTEST WITH ENOUGH REPUBLICAN VOTES? NANCY:

13:12 -- >> THE FREEDOM CAUCUS VOTED BEFORE CHRISTMAS TO ACCEPT THE

13:15 FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY ACT SPENDING LEVELS SO I AM A

13:17 LITTLE FRUSTRATED TO HEAR THAT NEWS TODAY.

13:22 SPEAKER JOHNSON HAS GOTTEN THAT DEAL PLUS SOME ADDITIONAL

13:27 SAVINGS SO IT IS EVEN BETTER THAN THE INITIAL NUMBER THAT

13:31 KEVIN MCCARTHY NEGOTIATED WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN, BUT LOOK, WHAT

13:35 SPEAKER JOHNSON HAS BEFORE HIM WITH THESE LEVELS IS HOW WILL

13:38 THESE SPENDING BILLS COME TO THE HOUSE FLOOR?

13:41 HOUSE REPUBLICANS DO NOT WANT AN OMNIBUS SPENDING BILL SO WE

13:44 HAVE THE JANUARY 19 DATE IN THE FEBRUARY 2 DATE THAT WE HAVE TO

13:48 CONTEND WITH EVEN IF WE HAVE THOSE SPENDING LEVELS.

13:51 THAT IS THE MISSION BEFORE US RIGHT NOW AND TIME IS OF THE

13:59 ESSENCE. JOE:

13:59 ETA LEGISLATIVE DAYS, KNOWING THAT THE SHUTDOWN WOULD BEGIN

14:03 AT LEAST IN PART THIS MONTH, REALIZING THAT THE BULK OF

14:07 EXPIRATIONS WOULD TAKE PLACE IN EARLY FEBRUARY.

14:10 CONGRESSMAN, WE KNOW SPEAKER JOHNSON MAY WELL ALLOW SOME

14:12 POLICY WRITERS HERE THAT WOULD BE SEEN AS POISON PILLS BY

14:15 DEMOCRATS AND WOULD BRING THIS WHOLE THING TO A HALT SO WHERE

14:18 ARE WE IN REALITY? WE JUST AGREED WE ARE BACK IN

14:22 JUNE HERE IN OUR VIRTUAL CLOCK. CAN THIS PASS OR DO YOU THINK

14:26 WE ARE GOING TO SHUT THINGS DOWN IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS?

14:29 >> THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT AND THIS IS WHAT IS FRUSTRATING

14:31 FOR ME, JOE. WE TALKED ABOUT IT BEFORE

14:34 CHRISTMAS THAT CHUCK SCHUMER DID NOT GET MUCH WORK DONE IN

14:36 THE SENATE. WE HAVE PASSED SEVEN OF THE 12

14:38 BILLS ACROSS THE HOUSE FLOOR AND THEY HAVE ALL GONE THROUGH

14:42 COMMITTEE AND YOU ARE EXACTLY RIGHT.

14:43 NOW THAT WE HAVE THE SPENDING LEVEL, WE GOT TO DETERMINE WHAT

14:45 ARE THE POLICY WRITERS THAT

14:52 WILL BE ACCEPTED -- RIDERS THAT WILL BE ACCEPTED?

14:55 HOW MANY CAN BE ACCEPTED IN THE SENATE?

14:57 THAT IS THE HARD WORK NOW TO GET THIS DRAFTED IN TWO PIECES

15:00 BEFORE JANUARY 9 AND FEBRUARY 2 AND WE DON'T KNOW UNTIL WE SEE

15:05 THE TEXT AND THAT IS, I'M SURE, AN ALL-NIGHT OPERATION FOR THE

15:06 NEXT FEW DAYS TO GET THAT PRODUCED. KAILEY:

15:10 ONE OF THE POLICIES IN QUESTION IN PARTICULAR IS WHEN IT COMES

15:12 TO BORDER SECURITY. I ASK HE SPOKE WITH ONE OF YOUR

15:17 COLLEAGUES, TEXAS -- I ACTUALLY SPOKE TO ONE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES

15:19 ABOUT WHAT HE WAS WILLING TO SETTLE FOR IN TERMS OF BORDER

15:22 POLICY IN ORDER TO FUND THE GOVERNMENT AND THIS IS WHAT HE

15:25 TOLD ME.

15:27 >> CONGRESS SHOULD USE ITS POWER TO FORCE CHANGE.

15:30 THAT IS WHAT I AM TELLING SPEAKER JOHNSON AND MY

15:32 REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES TO DO, TO HOLD THE FUNDING AND USE IT TO

15:35 FORCE AN ADMINISTRATION THAT IS IGNORING THE LAW TO DO THEIR

15:40 JOB. WE NEED TO WITHHOLD FUNDING UNTIL WE GET IT. KAILEY:

15:45 CONGRESSMAN HILL, HR TWO WAS PASSED BY THE HOUSE SOMETIME

15:46 AGO. IT WAS DEAD ON ARRIVAL. I WOULD IMAGINE IT IS NOT THAT

15:51 DIFFERENT NOW SO WHAT WILL THE HOUSE SETTLE FOR IF HR TWO IS A

15:56 NONSTARTER FOR THE SENATE AND THE WHITE HOUSE?

16:00 >> I WAS PLEASED TO GO TO THE BORDER LAST WEEK WITH SPEAKER

16:02 JOHNSON. THAT WAS MY SECOND TRIP DOWN TO

16:08 EAGLE PASS AND WHAT HE IS SAYING IS TRUE.

16:10 THE IDEAL POLICY CHANGES ARE CONTAINED IN HR TO BUT WE DON'T

16:17 HAVE 60 -- HR BUT WE DON'T2 HAVE 60 VOTES IN THE SENATE.

16:23 I WANT TO REFORM THE ASYLUM PROCESS AND THE CATCH AND

16:24 RELEASE PROCESS. THESE ARE POLICY DECISIONS THAT

16:29 JOE BIDEN MADE ON JANUARY 20, 2021.

16:31 THEY ARE NOT ENDING DECISIONS PER SE.

16:34 THEY ARE POLICY DECISIONS AND WHAT CHIP ROY AND I DEFINITELY

16:38 AGREE ON IS GETTING OUR POWER, THE POWER OF THE PURSE, TO

16:42 COMPEL POLICY CHANGES FROM THE PRESIDENT.

16:43 THOSE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS WE CAN DO.

16:46 THE QUESTION IS HOW MANY REPUBLICANS WILL WE GET?

16:49 WE WILL NOT GET THEM ALL, LET'S BE REALISTIC.

16:51 WE ARE NOT GOING TO GET EVERY REPUBLICAN TO SUPPORT THESE

16:54 EFFORTS, BUT JOE BIDEN RECOGNIZES THAT HE HAS TO DO

16:57 SOMETHING TO CORRECT HIS FAILING , FLEDGLING POLICIES ON

16:59 THE BORDER. AND YOU HEAR THAT FROM DEMOCRAT

17:03 MAYORS, FROM DEMOCRATIC SENATORS.

17:06 SO HE KNOWS HE HAS A POLITICAL PROBLEM AND THIS IS A TOP

17:09 PRIORITY FOR REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE SO I HOPE THERE IS

17:13 CREDIBLE COMPROMISE AVAILABLE HERE TO GET THIS DONE.

17:17 AND IT WILL BE JUST A STEP FORWARD.

17:18 IT WILL NOT SOLVE THE WHOLE PROBLEM. JOE:

17:21 REALIZING THAT IT MIGHT NOT BE SOMETHING YOU CALL

17:24 COMPREHENSIVE. WE TALKED ABOUT THAT WITH

17:26 FORMER TEXAS REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN, FORMER

17:31 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AND FORMER CIA OFFICIALS HAVE HAD

17:32 STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT ALL OF THIS.

17:35 HE TALKED TO ME ON BLOOMBERG RADIO ABOUT THE SITUATION ON

17:37 THE BORDER, HAVING REPRESENTED A BORDER DISTRICT.

17:38 HERE IS WHAT HE SAID.

17:42 >> THE BORDER IS CONTINUING TO BE A CRISIS.

17:44 I WILL BE HOPEFUL THAT SOMETHING GETS DONE BECAUSE THE

17:46 COMMUNITIES ALONG THE BORDER HAVE BEEN SUFFERING FOR FIVE

17:48 YEARS. JOE:

17:54 SO WHAT SHOULD OUR VIEWERS AND LISTENERS EXPECT TO HEAR,

17:57 CONGRESSMAN? TO YOUR POINT, WE ARE TALKING

18:01 ABOUT A MASSIVE ISSUE, WHAT SOME CALL THE THIRD RAIL.

18:03 YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS ENDED IT HAS

18:06 NOT HAPPENED. IS IT TIME TO TEMPER

18:08 EXPECTATIONS ON WHAT A FINAL PRODUCT MIGHT LOOK LIKE?

18:11 REP. HILL: PRESIDENT TRUMP STRUGGLED WITH

18:13 THIS IN HIS FOUR YEARS IN OFFICE AND HE FINALLY GOT A BIT

18:16 OF THE BALANCE BEFORE HE LEFT OFFICE AND THAT WAS THE REMAIN

18:18 IN MEXICO POLICY, THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE CREDIBLE

18:21 FEAR DAN DID AT THE BORDER. JOE BIDEN SAID 7.1 MILLION

18:27 ENCOUNTERS IN THREE YEARS -- HE HAS ALLOWED 3.3 MILLION PEOPLE

18:30 TO BE IN THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY UNDER A WORK PERMIT, WAITING

18:34 FOR AN ASYLUM HEARING, AND THAT IS I THINK AT THE CORE OF WHAT

18:39 DRIVES THESE CARAVANS TO THE BORDER IS THE PROMISE THAT YOU

18:42 CAN COME INTO THE U.S., STAY WAITING FOR AN ASYLUM HEARING,

18:44 MAYBE YOU CAN GET A JOB, MAYBE YOU CAN STAY, AND WE DO NOT

18:49 ENFORCE THE EXISTING LAW. THAT WOULD CUT DOWN ON THE FLOW.

18:53 300,000 PEOPLE IN DECEMBER ALONE , THE LARGEST NUMBER OF

18:57 PEOPLE CROSSING ILLEGALLY IN 20 YEARS, SO I HEAR YOU, BUT WE

19:02 KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO IMPROVE THE BORDER, AND THAT'S

19:07 REFORM THIS ASYLUM PROCESS, CATCH AND RELEASE PROCESS, AND

19:09 THE CREDIBLE FEAR STANDARD. I THINK THEY WOULD AGREE WITH

19:14 IT. UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAVE HAD NO

19:18 LEADERSHIP FROM PRESIDENT BIDEN OR HIS HOMELAND SECURITY

19:23 SECRETARY, MAYORKAS, IN THE PAST THREE YEARS ON THIS.

19:27 THEY HAVE TRULY TURNED THEIR BACK KAILEY: ON THIS TOPIC.

19:30 ALL RIGHT, CONGRESSMAN -- BACK ON THIS TOPIC. KAILEY:

19:35 ALL RIGHT, CONGRESSMAN. SHARES OF BOEING ARE LOWER

19:39 TODAY AFTER A BLOWOUT THAT CAUSED A LARGE PIECE OF A

19:40 PLAINTIVE ALL OFF MIDAIR. WE WILL HAVE MORE COMING NEXT

19:44 ON BALANCE OF POWER BLOOMBERG TV.

20:03 >> THIS IS ALASKA AIRLINES.

20:09 >> THAT WAS THE ALASKA AIRLINES FLIGHT 12 82 ON SATURDAY, A

20:13 SOUND YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR ON AN AIRPLANE, BOEING TAKING

20:17 STEPS TO RETURNING IT'S GROUNDED JETLINERS TO SERVICE

20:18 AFTER A PIECE OF A PLAIN BLUE

20:26 OFF MIDAIR -- BLEW OFF MIDAIR. GEORGE, THANK YOU FOR BEING

20:28 HERE. WE HAVE NEWS THIS AFTERNOON

20:31 THAT UNITED HAS FOUND LOOSE BOLTS IN MULTIPLE 737 MAX JETS

20:36 AS IT IS INSPECTING THEM. HOW FAR DO YOU THINK THIS

20:37 PROBLEM WILL EXTEND? HOW LONG WILL THESE PLANES STAY

20:39 GROUNDED? GEORGE: THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OVER 200

20:46 OF THESE AIRPLANES IN SERVICE AND SO IT CANNOT GO TOO FAR.

20:51 I THINK ON THE 737-8, YOU DON'T HAVE THE SITUATION WHERE YOU

20:52 ARE PLUGGING ONE OF THE EMERGENCY EXITS IF YOU DON'T

20:57 HAVE A HIGH DENSITY CONFIGURATION.

21:01 IT CAN ONLY BE THESE 200 SOMETHING AIRPLANES.

21:04 IT IS CONCERNING THIS UNITED NEWS.

21:09 IT TELLS ME IT IS PROBABLY ON THE MANUFACTURING LINE AND

21:10 SYSTEMICALLY, IT'S NOT FASTENING THINGS DOWN CORRECTLY

21:14 WHICH IS CONCERNING, BUT YOU KNOW, IT AGAIN GOES BACK TO,

21:17 YOU KNOW, BOEING AND SPIRIT. ESPECIALLY A SPIRIT, THERE

21:23 NEEDS TO BE BETTER -- AT SPIRIT, THERE NEEDS TO BE

21:25 BETTER TRAINING TO MAKE SURE EMPLOYEES KNOW EXACTLY WHAT

21:27 THEY NEED TO DO IN MANUFACTURING THESE AIRFRAMES.

21:29 JOE: INCREDIBLE LUCK THAT NO ONE WAS

21:35 SITTING IN THE SEAT NEXT TO WHAT BECAME A GAPING HOLE IN

21:36 THE SIDE OF THE PLANE. I HAVE TO ASK YOU WHAT

21:39 EVERYBODY IS THINKING -- WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF SOMEONE

21:42 HAD BEEN THERE? GEORGE: IT DEPENDS ON WHETHER OR NOT

21:45 YOUR BELTED IN. THEY TELL US TO STAY BELTED IN

21:51 WHEN YOU ARE NOT UP AND MOVING AROUND THE CABIN.

21:54 NOW YOU KNOW ONE REASON WHY.

22:00 SO YES, I THINK THAT'S -- KAILEY:

22:02 WE ONLY HAVE ABOUT ONE MINUTE LEFT BUT JUST QUICKLY, HOW

22:04 FINANCIALLY MATERIAL IS THIS GOING TO BE FOR BOEING? GEORGE:

22:09 WHEN WE DO THE ANALYSIS, WE THINK THE BIGGEST COST IS GOING

22:15 TO BE REMUNERATION TO THE AIRLINES FOR AIRLINES BEING OUT

22:19 OF SERVICE. OUR ANALYSIS, BASED ON ALASKA

22:22 PROFITABILITY AND LABOR COSTS -- ESSENTIALLY, THE AIRLINES

22:27 WILL BE COMPENSATED FOR LOST PROFITABILITY AND YOU CAN'T

22:29 SEND LABOR HOME JUST BECAUSE AN AIRLINE IS NOT FLYING.

22:31 WE THINK IT IS $5 MILLION A DAY FOR ALL 225 AIRPLANES THAT ARE

22:34 OUT OF SERVICE. NOT A LOT OF MONEY.

22:38 REPUTATION IS MORE OF A CHALLENGE HERE I THINK. JOE:

22:40 GREAT REPORTING. GEORGE WAS BLOOMBERG

22:45 INTELLIGENCE AS WE READ ON THE TERMINAL THAT BOEING IS MAKING

22:49 MOVES TO TRY AND GET AROUND THIS, ISSUING GUIDANCE TO

22:51 AIRLINES ON THE INSPECTIONS REQUIRED FOLLOWING A MIDAIR

22:52 FAILURE. THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

23:15 >> I AM VERY WORRIED THAT WE WILL BE A VERY DIFFERENT

23:20 COUNTRY, THAT CANNOT RELY ON THE RULE OF LAW AND TAKING IT

23:28 FOR GRANTED AS WE TRADITIONALLY HAVE IF WE EXPERIENCE A SECOND

23:32 TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.

23:36 >> FORMER U.S. SECRETARY AND WALL STREET WE

23:40 CONTRIBUTOR, LARRY SUMMERS, TALKING ABOUT HIS FEARS FOR THE

23:45 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. RACIAL GROUP HAS RELEASED ITS

23:49 LIST OF THE TOP GLOBAL RISKS THIS YEAR AND AT THE VERY TOP,

23:54 THE UNITED STATES VERSUS ITSELF. JOINING US NOW IS CLIFF, THE

24:00 CEO OF EURASIA GROUP. SO CLIFF, THE UNITED STATES

24:04 VERSUS ITSELF DOES NOT EXACTLY SOUND LIKE A RINGING

24:05 ENDORSEMENT OF THE AMERICAN DEMOCRATIC PROCESS.

24:10 -- PROCESS IN THE YEAR 2024. WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU MEAN BY

24:11 THIS? CLIFF: WE MEAN AS SOON AS DONALD TRUMP

24:18 GETS THE ENDORSEMENT, THE NOMINATION OF HIS PARTY, THIS

24:20 COUNTRY IS GOING TO TURN INTO TWO HALVES.

24:25 HE IS GOING TO CONTROL THE AGENDA, GET THE MONEY, GET THE

24:29 TV, START TO SET THE AGENDA AND THEN THE COUNTRY IS AT WAR WITH

24:33 ITSELF AS FAR AS WE ARE CONCERNED.

24:35 THE CAMPAIGN WILL BE UGLY. YOU HAVE INDICTMENT VERSUS

24:38 IMPEACHMENT, TWO OLD GUYS THAT NOBODY REALLY WANTS TO RUN.

24:43 DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS ARE ALREADY ERODING IN THIS COUNTRY

24:45 AND THEY WILL START YOU WROTE IN VERY QUICKLY I THINK AFTER

24:47 THE CAMPAIGN STARTS HEATING UP. JOE: LET'S WALK A LITTLE FURTHER

24:53 DOWN THAT PATH BECAUSE I AM CURIOUS WHAT YOU HAVE IN MIND.

24:56 WE HAVE BEEN HEARING REFERENCES TO THE CIVIL WAR ON THE

24:57 CAMPAIGN TRAIL. IT DONALD TRUMP OVER THE

24:58 WEEKEND IN IOWA. NIKKI HALEY WAS ASKED ABOUT

25:02 THAT. HOW FAR DOES THIS GO BEFORE WE

25:05 ARE HAVING THAT CONVERSATION AGAIN IN MODERN HISTORY? CLIFF:

25:10 I THINK WE WILL BE HAVING A CONVERSATION VERY SOON.

25:15 THE CIVIL WAR I THINK IS A BIT OVER-THE-TOP.

25:18 AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS -- THE GUYS THAT CREATED THIS COUNTRY

25:20 WERE REALLY SMART. THEY PUT THESE THREE CHECKS AND

25:22 BALANCES TOGETHER SO YOU CANNOT GO TOO FAR.

25:31 WE ARE GOING TO COME UP PRETTY BADLY BRUISED AFTER THAT.

25:41 WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHAT HAPPENS STARTING IN MARCH AND

25:43 THROUGH NOVEMBER. KAILEY: IS THE GREATER RISK IN YOUR

25:49 MIND TRUMP WINNING THE 2024 ELECTION OR HIM NOT WINNING IN

25:53 2024 AND MUCH LIKE 2020, CASTING DOUBT ON WHETHER THE

25:54 DEMOCRATIC PROCESS WORK? CLIFF: THERE IS LEGISLATION -- IT IS A

26:00 LOT HARDER TO GO BACK AND TRY AND REVISIT.

26:04 PLUS AND THE MIDTERMS, THE SECRETARIES OF STATE THAT WERE

26:06 ELECTION DENIERS, THEY ALL LOST. GOING AFTER A STEAL AGAIN

26:10 IS HARD. WHEN I LOOK AT THE NUMBERS, IF

26:16 THE ELECTION WERE HELD TODAY, I WOULD GO 60-40 FOR TRUMP.

26:19 HE HAS THE EDGE RIGHT NOW. THE GREATER RISK IS IF HE WINDS.

26:23 -- WINS. THEN WHAT DO WE GET?

26:29 HE MAKES THE CIVIL SERVICE INTO A POLITICAL SERVICE TO FIRE THE

26:30 PEOPLE HE DOES NOT LIKE AND THEN HE COULD CONVERT AND WOULD

26:35 CONVERT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, THE FBI, THE POLITICAL

26:37 INSTITUTIONS, TO GO AFTER HIS ENEMIES AND THE BIDEN'S.

26:41 PEOPLE IN THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION ARE SCARED THAT

26:44 THEY ARE GOING TO BE IN JEOPARDY, PERSONAL JEOPARDY,

26:49 THEIR FAMILIES, IF TRUMP WINS. HE SAID HIMSELF HE WOULD INDICT

26:51 JOE BIDEN USING LANGUAGE I CANNOT USE ON THE AIR.

26:55 CLIFF, WHEN WE LOOK DOWN THE LIST, NUMBER TWO, MIDDLE EAST

26:56 ON THE BRINK. BOTH OF THOSE DIRECTLY INVOLVED

27:00 THE UNITED STATES AT THIS POINT, DANTE?

27:03 >> --DON'T TODAY? CLIFF: VERY GOOD ALLIES OF THE UNITED

27:08 STATES. ISRAEL AND UKRAINE. BECAUSE OF THE BELIEF SYSTEM OF

27:13 THEIR LEADERS, IT COULD DRAG THIS COUNTRY INTO WARS WE

27:18 REALLY, REALLY DON'T WANT TO BE PART OF HERE.

27:23 UNTERMAN AND YAHOO!, SOME THINK HE WENT THE DOG -- HE MAY WANT

27:26 TO KEEP THE WAR GOING TO STAY OUT OF JAIL. CREDIBLE. OK.

27:33 IF HE GETS INTO A WAR WITH HEZBOLLAH, BOOM, WE ARE KIND OF

27:35 IN. UKRAINE, THE BLACK SEA IS A TINDERBOX.

27:40 IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG IN THE BLACK SEA -- UKRAINE IS

27:41 EXPORTING GRAIN VERY CLEVERLY AROUND THE BORDER COME AROUND

27:45 BULGARIA, ROMANIA. IF THE RUSSIANS -- THEY ARE TWO

27:53 THIS -- WE COULD -- THEY ARE DEBATING THIS.

27:54 WE COULD HAVE INTERNATIONAL CRISIS AND WAR AT SEA COULD

27:57 ESCALATE UGLY. WE ARE EXPOSED ON BOTH COUNTS.

28:00 KAILEY: I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE MIDDLE

28:02 EAST MORE. THIS IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT

28:05 SECRETARY OF STATE ANTONY BLINKEN, WHILE IN THE REGION,

28:08 SPOKE ABOUT, TALKING ABOUT THIS IDEA OF ESCALATION.

28:11 TAKE A LISTEN.

28:12 >> IT IS CLEARLY NOT IN THE INTEREST OF ANYONE, ISRAEL,

28:17 LEBANON, HEZBOLLAH, FOR THAT MATTER, TO SEE THIS ESCALATE.

28:24 AND TO SEE AN ACTUAL CONFLICT, AND THE ISRAELIS HAVE BEEN VERY

28:26 CLEAR WITH US THAT THEY WANT TO FIND A DIPLOMATIC WAY FORWARD.

28:29 KAILEY: THE U.S. HAS BEEN PUSHING THIS IDEA THAT

28:33 THEY WOULD NOT LIKE TO SEE THIS ESCALATE INTO A BROADER

28:35 REGIONAL CONFLICT. IT SEEMS LIKE WE GET CLOSER AND

28:38 CLOSER EVERY DAY IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE

28:40 HEADLINES. WHAT DOES A BROADER REGIONAL

28:41 CONFLICT ACTUALLY MEAN? WHAT IS IT MOST LIKELY TO LOOK

28:46 LIKE KNOWING THAT THERE IS IRANIAN PROXIES BUT OTHER ARAB

28:48 ALLIES IN THIS CONVERSATION AS WELL? CLIFF:

28:52 THE MOST LIKELY WAY WE GET THERE, AND I THINK WHAT IT

28:57 WOULD LOOK LIKE IF WE SEE IT IS ISRAEL ATTACKS HEZBOLLAH OR

28:59 HEZBOLLAH ATTACKS ISRAEL. ONCE WE GET THERE, THEN IRAN'S

29:08 MAIN PROXY, THE RESISTANT FRONT'S CROWN JEWEL IS IN PLAY

29:10 AND THEY ARE NOT GOING TO LET IT GET WORN DOWN VERY FAR

29:11 BEFORE THEY COME IN. IRAN DIRECTLY, RIGHT, AND THEN

29:16 WE HAVE THE TROOPS AROUND THE REVOLUTIONARY GUARD TROOPS IN

29:22 LEBANON. AT THE SAME TIME, IF ISRAEL

29:26 GETS PRESSED BY HEZBOLLAH AND IRAN, I THINK THE U.S.

29:28 IS IN ANYWAY IF THEY GET MIXED UP WITH AIR SUPPORT FROM THE

29:30 CARRIERS. THAT COULD ESCALATE VERY

29:31 QUICKLY. ONE WE MIGHT READ ABOUT IN

29:35 COMING WEEKS, MUCH SOONER, IS I THINK I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF

29:36 THE U.S.

29:38 DID NOT HIT THE WHO SEES -- HOUTHIES SOONER RATHER THAN

29:44 LATER. THERE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE PLAY

29:50 THERE BEFORE WE GET INTO REAL TROUBLE. JOE:

29:53 YOU HAVE BEEN PLAYING OUT SOME HORRIBLE SCENARIOS.

29:58 NUMBER THREE, BACK TO UKRAINE. A PARTITION OF UKRAINE, AS YOU

29:59 PUT IT. WE ARE GOING TO LEARN AT SOME

30:01 POINT IN THE COMING WEEKS WHETHER A BORDER DEAL EMERGES

30:06 IN WASHINGTON AND WHETHER FUNDING WILL FOLLOW.

30:11 IF THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN, DOES THAT NUMBER THREE, A

30:12 PARTITIONED UKRAINE, BECOME MORE LIKELY? CLIFF:

30:17 WE SAY THINGS AS WE SEE THEM. WE DON'T LIKE THEM AS MUCH AS

30:19 ANYBODY ELSE DOES. UKRAINE IS GOING IN A BAD

30:21 DIRECTION. FIRST OFF, EVEN IF WE GET

30:25 ANOTHER BIG APPROPRIATION THIS YEAR FOR UKRAINE, IT IS LIKELY

30:28 TO BE THE LAST BIG APPROPRIATION FOR THE UNITED

30:30 STATES.

30:31 IF TRUMP WINDS, FORGET IT -- WINS, FORGET IT.

30:34 IF YOU HAVE A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT AND LET'S THEY WE GET

30:38 A DEMOCRATIC SWEEP, NOT GOING TO HAPPEN, WE SEE IN THE MOVIES

30:42 IT'S HARD TO GET MONEY FOR UKRAINE NOW.

30:46 I THINK UKRAINE IS PROBABLY NOT GOING TO GET MUCH MORE THAN

30:47 THIS APPROPRIATION. UKRAINE -- THE MATERIAL

30:51 BALANCE, RUSSIA IS DOING BETTER ON MISSILES, ON MANPOWER.

30:54 RUSSIA IS ON THE OFFENSIVE.

31:00 I THINK UKRAINE HAS GOT TO STOP THE INFIGHTING IN THE

31:01 GOVERNMENT, THEY HAVE GOT TO SCALE UP WEAPONS PRODUCTION OR

31:05 I THINK NEXT YEAR, WE COULD TALK ABOUT UKRAINE BEGINNING TO

31:09 LOSE, LOSE MEANING TO MY HAVING TO ACCEPT AN UNFAVORABLE

31:12 ARMISTICE WHERE THEY GIVE UP MORE LAND. I DON'T LIKE THAT.

31:14 I AM AN AMERICAN. I DON'T LIKE THAT. JOE:

31:16 IT IS A GLOBAL RISK. CLIFF: WE CALL IT AS WE SEE IT.

31:20 THAT IS WHAT THAT IS. JOE: FASCINATING CONVERSATION AND A

31:24 SCARY ONE. CLIFF KUPCHAN JOINING US HERE

31:27 AT THE TABLE. WE WANT TO ADD THE VOICE OF

31:30 HOWARD BUFFETT, THE FOUNDER AND CEO OF THE FOUNDATION WHICH HAS

31:37 INVESTED MORE THAN 5 MILLION DOLLARS IN UKRAINE SINCE

31:38 RUSSIA'S INVASION. MR. BUFFETT, WELCOME TO

31:41 BLOOMBERG. YOU ARE JUST BACK FROM YOUR

31:44 10TH VISIT, I BELIEVE, TO UKRAINE, AND WE KNOW THAT THE

31:46 BOMBING CONTINUES. WE KNOW IT WAS A VIOLENT

31:50 WEEKEND AS RUSSIA CONTINUES TO LEAN IN THIS WINTER.

31:52 WHAT IS LIFE LIKE ON THE GROUND? HOWARD: IT IS REALLY TOUGH.

31:57 WHEN I LEFT THERE JANUARY 2, RUSSIA HAD STARTED A REAL

32:03 SERIOUS BOMBING CAMPAIGN WHICH THEY HAVE NOT ENDED YET.

32:07 YOU ARE SEEING MORE CIVILIANS DYING INCLUDING CHILDREN.

32:11 YOU KNOW, THIS IS PART OF THE RUSSIAN STRATEGY WHICH IS TO

32:17 WEAR PEOPLE DOWN, TO CREATE FATIGUE, AND OF COURSE, THAT

32:20 WILL WORK TO SOME DEGREE, BUT THERE ARE STILL -- THERE'S

32:24 STILL AN INCREDIBLE COMMITMENT BY THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE AND THE

32:28 SOLDIERS ON THE FRONT LINE. THEY ARE NOT GIVING UP.

32:33 THEY UNDERSTAND THEY ARE FIGHTING FOR THEIR FREEDOM.

32:35 THEY ARE FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES.

32:37 THEY ARE FIGHTING FOR DEMOCRACY AND THEY KNOW THEY CANNOT GIVE

32:42 UP. KAILEY:

32:43 WELL, THEY MAY NOT GIVE UP, BUT THERE IS A QUESTION, HOWARD, AS

32:47 WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING WITH LIFT, WHETHER OR NOT THE U.S.

32:52 IS GOING TO GIVE UP ON THIS CAUSE, PROVIDING MONETARY AND

32:53 MILITARY FUNDING. WHAT HAPPENS IN UKRAINE IF THE

32:55 U.S. HAS GIVEN ALREADY ALL IT IS GOING TO GIVE? HOWARD:

33:01 WELL, IT MAY BE THAT THE U.S. STOPS TEMPORARILY AND WHAT I

33:06 MEAN BY THAT IS IF UKRAINE FALLS, THEY WILL BE ON THE

33:11 DOORSTEP OF MANY OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.

33:14 PUTIN IS CLEVER AND HE HAS PATIENCE.

33:16 AT SOME POINT, HE'S GOING TO MAKE ADDITIONAL MOVES.

33:19 HIS GENERALS HAVE SAID HE'S GOING TO DO IT.

33:25 YOU LOOK AT PUTIN'S HISTORY, YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE HE'S GOING

33:26 TO DO IT. AT THAT POINT, NATO WILL GET

33:28 ENGAGED. PEOPLE WHO SAY WE CAN STEP OUT

33:34 OF NATO ARE VERY REALISTIC ABOUT OUR FUTURE.

33:38 UKRAINE IS FIGHTING NOT JUST THE MOST POWERFUL MILITARY IN

33:40 THE WORLD BUT ALSO FIGHTING REALLY BY PROXY IRAN AND NORTH

33:45 KOREA, SO UKRAINE IS FIGHTING THREE OF OUR LARGEST ENEMIES AT

33:48 THIS POINT IN TIME AND IF THAT IS NOT ENOUGH TO GET OUR

33:51 ATTENTION AND KEEP OUR ATTENTION, WE WILL DO IT

33:57 WITHOUT CHOICE WHEN THEY GET TO EUROPE'S DOORSTEP AND WE WILL

34:00 BE FIGHTING AS PART OF UKRAINE AND IF WE WITHDRAW FROM

34:03 UKRAINE, WE HAVE NO ALLIES AND NO FRIENDS IN THE WORLD WHEN WE

34:06 COME TO HAVING TO FIGHT OR DEAL WITH ANOTHER CONFLICT. JOE:

34:11 HOWARD, I KNOW YOU FOCUSED A LOT OF YOUR WORK ON FOOD

34:15 INSECURITY AROUND THE GLOBE, INCLUDING UKRAINE.

34:17 YOU CANNOT HAVE ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER AS WE LEARNED IN THE

34:21 INITIAL INVASION BY RUSSIA, THE INFLATION THAT WE SAW AND THE

34:23 FOOD SHORTAGES THAT OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD EXPERIENCE.

34:29 CLIFF KUPCHAN JUST SPELLED OUT GREAT WORRIES ABOUT WHAT COULD

34:32 TAKE PLACE IN THE BLACK SEA AND I WONDER HOW CONCERNED YOU ARE,

34:35 HOW REAL A THREAT IS AGAINST THE FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN IN

34:39 UKRAINE, WERE THAT TO HAPPEN? HOWARD:

34:43 IT HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED NOW.

34:48 I WOULD SAY THAT, YOU KNOW, UKRAINE IS DOWN BY 50%

34:51 PRODUCTION AND THEY HAVE 20% OF THE COUNTRY, ALMOST 20% OF THE

34:53 COUNTRY OCCUPIED BY RUSSIA WHICH HAS A LARGE PART OF THEIR

35:00 AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION AREAS AND SO, I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH

35:05 WORSE IT GETS, BUT IF THEY ESCALATE, IF RUSSIA ESCALATES

35:08 IN THE BLACK SEA, IT IS HARD TO TELL WHAT HAPPENS, BUT IT ALL

35:14 COMES DOWN TO HOW THE U.S. RESPONDS AND EUROPE RESPONDS,

35:17 AND I THINK, YOU KNOW, IF YOU START LISTENING -- IF YOU START

35:25 LISTENING TO THE OTHER FOREIGN MINISTERS, PRIME MINISTERS IN

35:28 MOST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, THEY UNDERSTAND HOW SERIOUS THIS IS

35:30 AND HOW SIGNIFICANT IT CAN BE FOR THEM AND THEY NEED THE

35:33 UNITED STATES AS AN ALLY AND WE WILL NEED THEM IN THE FUTURE SO

35:37 WE ARE IN THIS ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. KAILEY:

35:43 SOMETHING YOU HEAR OFTEN FROM THOSE WHO ARE MORE HESITANT AND

35:44 RESISTANT TO THE IDEA OF PROVIDING FURTHER AID TO

35:48 UKRAINE IS THIS IDEA OF ACCOUNTABILITY, MAKING SURE THE

35:51 FUNDS ARE USED APPROPRIATELY AS INTENDED.

35:55 HAVE YOU SEEN EVIDENCE THAT PERHAPS THERE IS MISUSE

36:00 HAPPENING? HOWARD:

36:02 NO, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE TO USE THAT ARGUMENT AND THERE'S

36:06 BEEN ALMOST NO CREDIBLE PROOF OF HOW IT HAS BEEN MISUSED.

36:09 IN A WAR, YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE SOME THINGS GET USED

36:14 INAPPROPRIATELY, BUT YOU KNOW, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING --

36:16 THIS NARRATIVE NEVER GETS REPEATED.

36:21 IF YOU GO BACK TO BLINKEN'S DECEMBER 20, I THINK IT WAS,

36:24 PRESS CONFERENCE, JUST NOT EVEN A MONTH AGO, HE MADE THE POINT

36:28 THAT 90% OF ALL OF THE MILITARY ASSISTANCE WE ARE PROVIDING IS

36:32 IN THE UNITED STATES. WHAT WE ARE DOING IS SUPPORTING

36:36 THOUSANDS OF DROPS ACROSS 30 ONES -- JOBS IN THE DEFENSE

36:43 INDUSTRY SO NONE OF THAT MONEY IS MISAPPROPRIATED.

36:44 IT IS ALL HERE IN THE UNITED STATES.

36:46 SOME MONEY IS GOING FOR OTHER PURPOSES BUT I CAN TELL YOU

36:50 THAT THE PEOPLE THAT WE DEAL WITH, THE MINISTERS WE DEAL

36:55 WITH, YOU KNOW, THEY ARE STANDUP PEOPLE.

36:56 THEY ARE TRYING TO DO THE BEST JOB THAT THEY CAN DO IN AN

37:00 INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT SITUATION. I TRUST THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE.

37:05 IS THERE A PROBLEM WITH CORRUPTION?

37:07 OF COURSE THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH CORRUPTION IN THE COUNTRY

37:09 AND THE PRESIDENT IS DOING HIS BEST TO ADDRESS IT AT A VERY

37:13 DIFFICULT TIME SO I HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THE SUPPORT THE

37:18 UNITED STATES GIVES TO UKRAINE, THE MAJORITY -- ALMOST ALL OF

37:20 IT IS GOING WHERE IT IS SUPPOSED TO GO AND DOING WHAT

37:22 IT IS SUPPOSED TO DO. YOU CANNOT HAVE 100% WHEN YOU

37:24 ARE FIGHTING A WAR. IT IS NOT GOING TO BE PERFECT.

37:28 JOE: THE PEOPLE OF IOWA ARE GOING TO

37:32 START VOTING ONE WEEK FROM TODAY AS WE BEGIN THE PROCESS

37:34 OF SELECTING A REPUBLICAN NOMINEE.

37:36 A LOT OF FOLKS THINK ALREADY THAT WILL BE DONALD TRUMP.

37:39 WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN FOR THIS ENTIRE CONVERSATION MOVING

37:40 FORWARD? HOWARD: WELL, IT'S A LITTLE CONCERNING

37:47 IF HE DOES EVERYTHING THAT HE SAYS HE'S GOING TO DO.

37:51 HE SAYS HE CAN END THE WAR IN 24 HOURS. I'M NOT SURE.

37:53 HE HAS NEVER DEFINED WHAT THAT MEANS AND IT CAN MEAN DIFFERENT

37:55 THINGS BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU END THE WAR IN 24 HOURS AND

37:59 HAVE UKRAINE COME OUT IN A VERY GOOD POSITION.

38:00 HE HAS TALKED ABOUT WITHDRAWING FROM NATO.

38:07 YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES, A LOT OF POLITICIANS SAY THINGS THAT

38:08 THEY ARE NOT GOING TO DO SO I CANNOT JUDGE THAT.

38:13 BUT IF WE WITHDRAW FROM NATO, WE WILL HAVE SOME SIGNIFICANT

38:17 ISSUES IN THE NEAR FUTURE WHEN WE NEED ALLIES AND WE NEED

38:19 FRIENDS. WE WILL NOT HAVE ANY. I THINK I WOULD DEFER TO SEE

38:25 WHAT HE ACTUALLY DOES DO BECAUSE ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER

38:31 THAN WORDS BUT IT IS A CONCERN IN TERMS OF UKRAINE. KAILEY:

38:36 ALL RIGHT, HOWARD. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

38:38 US. THAT IS HOWARD BUFFETT OF THE

38:40 HOWARD BUFFETT FOUNDATION. COMING UP, THE IOWA CAUCUSES

38:43 ARE ONLY ONE WEEK AWAY. WE WILL BE JOINED BY OUR

38:46 POLITICAL PANEL TO DISCUSS WHAT TO LOOK FORWARD TO AND WHAT IT

38:49 ALL MEANS. THIS IS BALANCE OF POWER ON

38:52 BLOOMBERG TV.

39:08 >> I THINK THE CHOICE ON THE 15TH IS CLEAR.

39:14 DONALD TRUMP IS RUNNING FOR HIS ISSUES.

39:17 NIKKI HALEY IS RUNNING FOR HER DONORS ISSUES.

39:19 I AM RUNNING FOR YOUR ISSUES.

39:21 >> I HAVE READ ALL THE THINGS THAT THEY ARE SAYING AND THESE

39:24 FELLOWS ARE JUST SPENDING SO MUCH TIME ON ME AND IT IS

39:25 REALLY SWEET OF THEM.

39:32 BUT IF YOU LOOK AT EVERY ONE OF THOSE, EVERY SINGLE THING,

39:38 EVERY COMMERCIAL RON HAS PUT UP THERE HAS BEEN ALIVE. KAILEY:

39:44 THAT WAS FLORIDA GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS AND FORMER SOUTH

39:45 CAROLINA GOVERNOR NIKKI HALEY OVER THE WEEKEND AS THE

39:48 PRESSURE MOUNTS ONE WEEK AHEAD OF THE IOWA CAUCUSES.

39:51 JOINING US NOW WITH MORE IS OUR POLITICAL PANEL, RICK DAVIS,

39:54 AND JEANNIE. SO RICK, WE ARE ONE WEEK OUT.

40:02 HOW MUCH REALISTICALLY CAN CHANGE FOR RON DESANTIS OR

40:03 NIKKI HALEY WITHIN THE SPAN OF ONE WEEK WHEN DONALD TRUMP IS

40:14 STILL PULLING ROUGHLY AROUND -- POLLING ROUGHLY AROUND 50%?

40:21 RICK: WILL IOWA UPSET THE APPLE CART?

40:24 PROBABLY NOT. THE GROUP THAT USUALLY DOES IT

40:27 IS THE EVANGELICAL COMMUNITY. THEY ARE USUALLY VERY

40:28 HOMOGENEOUS. THEY ALL WORK IN MASS AND IT IS

40:34 HALF THE CAUCUS-GOERS WHO ATTEND CAUCUSES IN IOWA BUT

40:38 THIS TIME, THEY ARE SPLIT BETWEEN RON DESANTIS AND DONALD

40:40 TRUMP AND THAT TAKES AWAY SOME OF THE IMPACT THAT THEY COULD

40:43 HAVE, ESPECIALLY IN A SURPRISE MOVE LIKE, YOU KNOW, LIKE

40:48 DONALD TRUMP HAVING A CLOSER THAN OTHERWISE EXPECTED.

40:51 THE REAL QUESTION I HAVE IS CAN DONALD TRUMP ACTUALLY WIN EVERY

40:56 SINGLE COUNTY IN IOWA? IF YOU ARE AT 50%, YOU ARE

41:01 LOOKING AT A SWEEP. INCREDIBLE. YOU KNOW THE SAYING, OUR PICKS

41:06 CORN, NEW HAMPSHIRE PICKS PRESIDENTS?

41:09 WOULD THAT BE DIFFERENT THIS TIME IF DONALD TRUMP WEDNESDAY

41:10 IOWA CAUCUSES? WILL HE BE THE NOMINEE --

41:14 DONALD TRUMP WINDS THE IOWA CAUCUSES -- WINS THE IOWA

41:19 CAUCUSES, WILL HE BE THE NOMINEE?

41:25 JEANNIE: THE LAST ONE TO WIN WITH GEORGE

41:27 W. BUSH. WHAT HE HAD IN 2000 WHEN HE DID

41:31 THAT, HE HAD THE SUPPORT OF EVANGELICALS AND THE MORE

41:34 TRADITIONAL MODERATE, INDEPENDENT, IF YOU WILL, WING

41:36 OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND THE WINNERS WHO HAVE WON 2008,

41:43 2012, 20 16, SINCE THEN, THEY HAVE HAD MORE SUPPORT OF THE

41:45 EVANGELICALS SO THEY COULD WIN IOWA BUT NOT CARRY IT THROUGH.

41:47 AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT TRUMP HERE IS HE

41:52 HAS GROWN HIS SUPPORT AMONG EVANGELICALS AND HONESTLY --

41:59 ENO RMOUSLY SINCE 2016. THE EVANGELICAL VOTE WILL BE

42:01 CRITICAL BUT DONALD TRUMP ALSO HAVE TO BE CAREFUL AND WE ARE

42:04 HEARING IT FROM HIS CAMPAIGN AND FROM DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE

42:07 IS THIS GOING TO BE A CASE WHERE WINNING IS LOSING?

42:12 IN OTHER WORDS, HE WINS BUT NOT BY SUCH BIG MARGINS.

42:16 WE HAVE HEARD THEM SAYING THE LARGEST MAJORITY IN IOWA WAS

42:19 BOB DOLE IN 1988 AT 12 POINTS SO IF WE BEAT THAT, WE ARE GOOD

42:21 TO GO. YES, BUT YOU ARE UP 30 POINTS

42:25 RIGHT NOW, SO YOU KNOW, HE DOES HAVE THE EXPECTATIONS ISSUE TO

42:27 CONTEND WITH. KAILEY: AND THAT IS JUST IN IOWA.

42:33 THE QUESTION FOR A CANDIDATE LIKE NIKKI HALEY IS CAN HE PUT

42:37 UP A STRONG ENOUGH SECOND-PLACE SHOWING, EMERGENT OF 12.5% TO

42:40 CARRY THAT THROUGH NEW HAMPSHIRE AND THEN POTENTIALLY

42:41 TO YOUR HOME STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA?

42:45 LOOKING AT THE LATEST EMERSON POLE, TRUCK PERCENT.

42:50 NIKKI HALEY, 20 5% IN SOUTH CAROLINA.

42:53 IF YOU CANNOT EVEN WIN AT HOME, ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HER REALLY

42:54 AS A SERIOUS CONTENDER? RICK: IT DEPENDS LARGELY -- JEANNE:

43:01 IT DEPENDS LARGELY ON WHAT HAPPENS IN IOWA.

43:03 A CLOSER THAN EXPECTED SECOND. IF SHE IS ABLE TO COME IN CLOSE

43:06 OR INDEED BEAT TRUMP IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SHE IS NARROWING

43:10 THE GAP THERE, SHE COULD GET MOMENTUM INTO SOUTH CAROLINA.

43:14 BUT I HAVE BEEN WATCHING, AND TRUMP IS HITTING HER

43:18 INCREASINGLY. HE'S USING RON DESANTIS AND

43:21 VIVEK RAMASWAMY'S LINE THAT SHE IS BOUGHT AND SOLD BY THE

43:22 DONORS. SHE IS NOT A REAL REPUBLICAN,

43:28 THAT SHE IS A LIAR, A FLIP-FLOPPER, SHE CAME TO

43:29 MAR-A-LAGO AND PROMISED NOT TO RUN AGAINST HIM AND THEN OOPS,

43:32 SHE DID. HE IS STARTING TO HIT HER HARD

43:35 AND YOU CAN BET SHE COMES IN CLOSE IN IOWA AND CLOSER OR

43:39 BEATS HIM IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, THE RACE IS GOING TO BE ON RIGHT TO

43:43 HER HOME STATE AND SHE'S GOING TO HAVE A RACE ON HER HANDS

43:44 AGAINST TRUMP THERE. JOE: WHILE WE ARE TALKING SOUTH

43:50 CAROLINA, THAT IS WHERE JOE BIDEN WAS TODAY, THE PRESIDENT

43:52 LEAVING THE BELTWAY AND WENT TO SOUTH CAROLINA TO DELIVER A

43:55 SPEECH. THIS VISIT AS PART OF AN EFFORT

43:59 TO SECURE MORE BLACK VOTERS IN THIS CAMPAIGN. LET'S LISTEN.

44:02 PRES. BIDEN: IT'S BECAUSE OF THIS

44:03 CONGREGATION IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND

44:08 NOT AN EXAGGERATION, IN JIM CLYBURN, THAT I STAND HERE

44:10 TODAY AS YOUR PRESIDENT BECAUSE OF ALL OF YOU. THAT IS A FACT.

44:16 JOE: RICK DAVIS, WE TALKED ABOUT HIS

44:18 CHALLENGES HERE WITH BLACK VOTERS AND THE WORK YOU WILL

44:22 HAVE TO DO THAT HAS BEEN MADE MORE DIFFICULT BY THE SITUATION

44:25 IN ISRAEL BUT HE'S TALKING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AT THE

44:27 PODIUM RIGHT NOW AS IF HE'S ALREADY THE NOMINEE.

44:29 IS THAT THE RIGHT STRATEGY? RICK:

44:33 YOU HAVE TO EXPECT THAT EVERY SPEECH HE GIVES EITHER AS

44:36 CANDIDATE BIDEN OR PRESIDENT BIDEN IS GOING TO INCLUDE AN

44:38 ATTACK ON DONALD TRUMP. THEY HAVE MADE A CALCULATION

44:43 AND PROBABLY NOT A BAD ONE THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE RUNNING

44:46 AGAINST DONALD TRUMP AND THEY ARE GOING TO START POSITIONING

44:49 HIM VIS-A-VIS ALL THESE CONSTITUENCIES.

44:51 I WOULD NOTE IT WAS KIND OF INTERESTING AT THE START OF

44:53 THAT SPEECH, HE HAD A LITTLE PROTEST MOVEMENT INSIDE THE

44:59 CHURCH ABOUT LET'S HAVE A CEASE-FIRE IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

45:01 SO HE IS GOING TO HAVE THAT HAUNTING HIM EVERYWHERE HE GOES

45:07 SO HE IS IN A MODE NOW WHERE EVERYTHING HE DOES IS GOING TO

45:09 BE A POLITICAL SPEECH REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT IS AN

45:13 OFFICIAL PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN SPEECH, OFFICIAL PRESIDENTIAL

45:14 SPEECH OR CAMPAIGN SPEECH. KAILEY:

45:19 IT IS BLACK VOTERS, YOUNG VOTERS AS WELL.

45:22 OBVIOUSLY OVERARCHING LATE, WE KNOW BIDEN HAS AN ECONOMY ISSUE

45:25 BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE PROTESTERS AT THE SPEECH TODAY

45:27 AND LOOK AT HIS APPROVAL NUMBERS ON THE BORDER WHICH ARE

45:30 KIND OF ABYSMAL, MORE THAN 60% DISAPPROVE OF HIS HANDLING OF

45:33 THAT ISSUE. WHAT IS HIS BIGGEST PROBLEM

45:36 WITH HIS CORE DEMOGRAPHICS RIGHT NOW? JEANNE:

45:40 I THINK THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS. ONE IS ISRAEL.

45:43 HIS CORE CONSTITUENCY, YOU KNOW, JUST LOOK AT BLACK VOTERS.

45:48 WE SAW IN THE SIX SWING STATES DONALD TRUMP GETTING 22% OF

45:50 SUPPORT AMONGST BLACK VOTERS. IN 2020, HE WON EIGHT.

45:56 IN 2016, HE WAS AT 6% SO THAT IS AN ENORMOUS PROBLEM FOR THE
