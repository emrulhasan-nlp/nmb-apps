00:10 >> I DOING FEEL LIKE THE MARKET HAS BEEN CRAZY.

00:13 I SEE THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME UPSIDE.

00:15 >> MARK IS BEING VERY RATIONAL.

00:18 >> INVESTORS ARE IN A NEW REGIME THE LAST 10 YEARS.

00:21 >> THE FED IS NOT FIGHTING AS BIG AN INFLATION PROBLEM AS WE

00:26 THOUGHT 10 DAYS AGO.

00:28 >> WE THINK THINGS WILL SLOW DOWN BY THE END OF THE YEAR.

00:32 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE WITH TOM KEENE

00:33 JONATHAN FERRO AND LISA ABRAMOWICZ. JONATHAN:

00:40 STAY IN BED, THE WEEK BEGINS TOMORROW, LIVE FROM NEW YORK

00:42 CITY, GOOD MORNING, GOOD MORNING, FOR OUR AUDIENCE

00:44 WORLDWIDE, THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE ON TV AND RADIO.

00:51 EQUITY FUTURES ARE JUST ABOUT POSITIVE ON THE S&P 500.

00:54 CPI DATA TOMORROW MORNING, PPI AFTER THAT AND THEN EARNINGS

00:58 SEASON BEGINS. TOM: ITS A TERRIBLE TURN OF THE

01:01 MARKET TODAY.

01:07 WHAT IT IS TO ME IS SETTING UP THIS ARCH BATTLE BE ON THE

01:10 INFLATION REPORT TO THE BEGINNING OF EARNINGS SEASON.

01:12 WE START STRONG TODAY WITH

01:18 JASON TRENNER OF STRATEGAS HOW ARE YOU IN THE MARKET GIVEN

01:20 THIS NEW INFORMATION? JONATHAN: A SEVEN HANDLE WAGE GROWTH IN

01:24 THE UNITED KINGDOM. THIS IS THEIR LANGUAGE THEY ARE

01:31 USING -- GROWTH REMAINS UNCOMFORTABLY HIGH.

01:35 CAN YOU IMAGINE GOING INTO YOUR ANNUAL REVIEW AND SAYING BANK

01:39 GROWTH REMAINS UNCOMFORTABLY HIGH? LISA:

01:43 THAT'S WHAT THE BANK OF ENGLAND WANTS.

01:47 THEY ARE SAYING ASK FOR LESS AND THAT'S SORT OF THIS

01:51 UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATION THEY'RE PROJECTING. TOM:

01:59 IT SAY KEYNESIAN MADNESS BUT ITS A THROWBACK TO THE MIDDLE

02:01 OF THE 20TH CENTURY AND THE INFLATION OF THE 70'S.

02:05 I JUST DOPE BY IT, ITS BAD MATH. JONATHAN: EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF.

02:09 GOOD LUCK TO YOU. TOM: 7% IS A BIG NUMBER.

02:16 JONATHAN: A BIG NUMBER FOR THE BANK OF

02:23 ENGLAND WHO MAYBE HAKE SEVEN -- YOU MAY HIKE AGAIN. LISA:

02:28 THAT IS THE THEME OF THE WEEK ESPECIALLY WITH THE RHETORIC WE

02:30 HEARD OUT OF FED OFFICIALS YESTERDAY NOT ONLY IN ENGLAND

02:32 BUT YOU'RE SEEING IT IN THE U.S., SIMILAR TOWN THAT PERHAPS

02:36 THEY HAVE TO GO FURTHER TO GET INFLATION UNDER CONTROL.

02:38 THE QUESTION IN THE U.S. OF WHETHER INFLATION IS ROLLING

02:44 OVER BUT IN THE U.K., ITS ANOTHER STORY.

02:47 THAT'S THE DIFFICULTY AT A TIME WHEN THEY ARE SEEING SOME SORT

02:49 OF HIT TO THE ECONOMIC GROWTH. TOM:

02:51 JUST LOOK AT THE BOND MARKET.

02:58 YOU'VE GOT TO HOLISTICALLY LOOK AT THE DYNAMICS OF THE BOND

03:01 MARKET AND THE SPREADS OF THE REAL YIELD.

03:05 EVEN ON A BORING TUESDAY, YOU GOT TO PARSE THAT AND SAY THAT

03:07 YIELDS HAVE COME IN OVER THE LAST THREE DAYS. JONATHAN:

03:10 LISA WILL MAKE THIS LESS BORING IN A MOMENT.

03:13 BRIEFLY ON THE S&P 500, WE ARE POSITIVE BY ZERO .1% ON THE S&P

03:19 500. THE TWO YEAR YIELD IS DOWN FOR

03:22 A THIRD STRAIGHT SESSION, DOWN BY THREE BASIS POINTS.

03:27 THE 10 YEAR IS DOWN ABOUT FOUR BASIS POINTS. LISA:

03:34 I'M THINKING YOU CAN ASK IF YOU WANT MORE OR LESS HONESTY.

03:39 WHAT WE ARE WATCHING IS A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT EVENTS

03:42 INCLUDING THE NATO SUMMIT WHICH KICKS OFF IN LITHUANIA THIS

03:43 MORNING. WE SAW A PRESIDENT BIDEN

03:46 MEETING WITH THE LITHUANIAN PRESIDENT AND HE WILL SPEAK

03:50 WITH STOLTENBERG SHORTLY AT 11:00 A.M..

03:52 THEN YOU HAVE HEARD A GUN OF TURKEY MEETING WITH BIDEN AND

03:56 I'M CURIOUS TO HEAR WHAT SOME OF THE ARRANGEMENTS ARE WITH

03:58 F-16S AND OTHER TYPES OF PROVISIONS FOR TURKEY IN ORDER

04:02 TO EASE SOME OF THE OTHER DISCUSSIONS.

04:05 THROUGH THE WEEK, THE SUN VALLEY CONFERENCE ON THE FUTURE

04:06 OF NEW MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT. LAST YEAR WAS ALL ABOUT TWITTER

04:10 AND THIS YEAR, ELON MUSK WILL NOT EVEN BE THERE.

04:15 THE TWITTER PLATFORM IS IN THE CENTER WITH THE ADVENT OF

04:19 THREAD META SHARES UP 300% JUST THIS YEAR.

04:24 LATER TODAY, WE ARE LOOKING AT AMAZON PRIME DAY WHICH NO ONE

04:26 HAS TALKED ABOUT.

04:32 TO ME, THIS USED TO BE A FALSE ADVERTISING HOLIDAY.

04:38 THIS IS DRUMMING UP CONFIDENCE AND ENTHUSIASM FOR THIS AND NOW

04:41 WHAT YOU ARE SEEING IS A WHOLE HOST OF COMPETITORS TRYING TO

04:45 GET IN ON THAT AND HAVING SAILED DAYS AND NOT RELYING ON

04:49 THIS MUCH AND YOU'RE SEEING A SLOWDOWN IN GAINS. TOM:

04:53 THE PILE OF BOXES AT MIGHT WALK UP GETS BIGGER AND BIGGER.

04:59 THE UNIT GROWTH OF AMAZON, ITEM C ANY END IN SIGHT. JONATHAN:

05:05 MAYBE 40% OFF OF GOLF CLUBS ON PRIME DAY. LISA:

05:10 ONE OF THE BEST DEALS IS RUMBA. THAT'S THE PERSONAL VACUUM

05:14 CLEANER THAT GOES BY ITSELF. JONATHAN: RIGHT.

05:21 TOM: SOMEONE TOLD ME ONCE TO BUY AMAZON PRIME.

05:28 JONATHAN: VACUUMS, COOL. LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT LATER.

05:34 JASON JOINS US NOW. WONDERFUL TO CATCH UP WITH YOU.

05:39 LET'S TALK ABOUT THE WEEK AHEAD WITH INFLATION DATA TOMORROW

05:41 AND BANK EARNINGS FRIDAY IN WHICH ONE DO YOU WANT TO SEE

05:42 IMMEDIATELY?

05:45 >> I THINK YOU WOULD WANT TO SEE LOWER INFLATION.

05:48 THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE YOU WILL GET IT.

05:54 THIS IS THE EASIEST COMPARISON FOR CPI PROBABLY OF THE YEAR

05:57 BECAUSE YOU PEAKED IN JULY OF LAST YEAR.

06:01 THIS IS A GOOD ONE, HOPEFULLY WE GET A GOOD ONE BECAUSE IF WE

06:05 DOPE, THE COMPARISONS WILL GET TOUGHER FROM HERE.

06:12 FOR BANKS, THE EXPECTATIONS ARE RELATIVELY LOW ALREADY.

06:15 I THINK THERE IS A DECENT CHANCE THE BANKS WILL BEAT

06:18 THOSE LOWERED EXPECTATIONS.

06:19 TO ME, THE CPI NUMBER IS A BIGGER MOVE OVER THE MARKET

06:27 THIS WEEK. TOM: YOU WERE DOING QUALITY BEFORE

06:32 QUALITY WAS IN AND THE BASIC TEAM HAS BEEN YOU GOT TO BE IN

06:36 THE MARKET, YOU CANNOT GO IN AND OUT, YOU HAVE TO

06:39 PARTICIPATE BUT YOU'VE ALWAYS GOT TO PARTICIPATE WITH QUALITY.

06:43 WHERE IS THE QUALITY RIGHT NOW?

06:48 >> AS YOU KNOW, THINGS HAVE WORKED OUT BETTER THAN OTHERS.

06:51 IT WORKED WELL LAST YEAR BUT HAS IT WORK SECURELY WELL THIS

06:53 YEAR.

07:00 I FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT THAT NOW BECAUSE I KNOW THE VALUATIONS

07:07 OF THE OVERALL MARKET ARE PARTICULARLY COMPELLING3+ I

07:12 THINK THE RISK REWARD IS QUITE POOR GIVEN HER EXPECTATIONS FOR

07:15 THE ECONOMY AND FOR EARNINGS OVER THE NEXT YEAR.

07:18 DEPENDING ON THE NUMBERS YOU ARE LOOKING AT, THE MARKET IS

07:22 TRADING AT 20 TIMES TRAILING. ITS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 19 AND 20

07:28 ON FORWARD EARNINGS DEPENDING ON THE EARNINGS YOU ARE USING.

07:33 I THINK THE EARNINGS EXPECTATIONS FOR 2024 IN MY

07:36 OPINION ARE MUCH TOO HIGH, OF ABOUT 12%. TOM:

07:39 HOW MUCH CASH DO YOU HAVE? IS THERE A CASH HOARDING?

07:46 >> WE HAVE A BALANCED PORTFOLIO. WE HAVE A MODEL PORTFOLIO AND

07:52 WE HAVE 6% CASH RIGHT NOW. THAT'S AT THE UPPER END OF OUR

07:55 RANGE. I THINK IT MAKES SOME SENSE

07:59 GIVEN WHERE THE VALUATIONS ARE. LISA:

08:04 WE STARTED THE PROGRAM TALKING ABOUT HOW IT IS A SLEEPY SUMMER

08:05 AND PEOPLE ARE TAKING A BREAK. HOW ARE YOU RESETTING AT A TIME

08:14 OF PERHAPS A PAUSE WITH LESS DRAMATIC VOLATILITY IN TERMS OF

08:18 BOND YIELDS AND STOCKS TO SHIFT YOUR ALLOCATIONS?

08:22 >> I THINK IN THE END, I THINK STOCK PRICES ARE LARGELY ABOUT

08:28 INTEREST RATES AND EARNINGS. I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD TAKE A

08:32 STEP BACK. THERE HAS BEEN SOME PERFORMANCE

08:34 CHASING AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER, PARTICULAR AS IT

08:39 RELATES TO AI. I UNDERSTAND THAT AND I WOULD

08:43 STAND IN FRONT OF THAT BUT BY THE SAME TOKEN, I WOULD KIND OF

08:49 TAKE A STEP BACK AND START TAKING A LOOK AT 2020 FOR

08:54 EARNINGS. WHEN THE EARNINGS SEASON STARTS

08:57 HERE, I WOULD BE PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION TO WHAT THE GUIDANCE

08:59 IS GOING TO BE. THE SELL SIDE HAS NOT REALLY

09:02 TAKEN THE NUMBERS DOWN. EARNINGS EXPECTATIONS FOR 2024

09:07 DOWN THREE OR 4% YEAR TO DATE. BUT THE MARKET IS UP 15.

09:14 NOW YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THE 10 YEAR TREASURY YIELDS ARE

09:17 PIERCING THROUGH 4% MORE OR LESS THAT'S JUST NOT CONSISTENT.

09:26 ITS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THOSE FACTS AND IT SEEMS THERE WILL

09:28 BE SOME COMEUPPANCE IF WE CONTINUE ON THIS PATH. LISA:

09:32 OVER THE PAST WEEK OR SO, NEW PAPER CAME OUT BY A FED

09:34 ECONOMIST THAT SAID A LOT OF THE GAINS, ABOUT 40% OF THEM

09:38 AND STOCKS OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF DECADES HAS BEEN A

09:43 MECHANICAL EXPLANATION BASED ON WHAT WE'VE SEEN FROM RATES AND

09:46 FROM COMPANIES ABLE TO TAKE THOSE LOW RATES AND PUT THEM

09:48 INTO HIGHER PROFITS. AS THE FED RESEARCHERS SAID, DO

09:56 YOU THINK THERE WILL BE A MECHANICALLY LOWER RATE RETURN

09:59 FOR EQUITIES GENERALLY? IS THAT HOW YOU ARE ARRANGING

10:02 SOME OF YOUR PORTFOLIOS FOR THE LONGER TERM?

10:05 >> I DID READ THE PAPER BUT I AM SYMPATHETIC TO THE CONCEPT

10:11 THAT ITS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT

10:17 TO REPRISE THE QUANTITATIVE EASING AND ALMOST NEGATIVE REAL

10:18 RATES FOR 12 YEARS. AS A RESULT, THE FORWARD

10:24 RETURNS, ONE WOULD HAVE TO THINK WILL NEED TO BE LOWER.

10:29 I AM OF THE VIEW THAT QUANTITATIVE EASING FOR 12

10:33 YEARS WAS ANNA NORMA'S POLICY ERROR THAT WE WILL HAVE TO DEAL

10:35 WITH FOR A LONG TIME. IT MEANS YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING

10:42 TO HAVE HIGHER INTEREST RATES AND HIGHER LONG-TERM INFLATION

10:43 FOR A LONG TIME. THAT PUTS PRESSURE ON MULTIPLES.

10:49 IT ALSO MAKES IT HARDER FOR COMPANIES TO BUY BACK THEIR OWN

10:52 STOCK. IT ALSO MAKES IT HARDER FOR

10:56 PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS TO BE AS INVOLVED AS THEY HAVE BEEN.

11:00 THERE IS A PERFECT STORM IN A WAY IN WHICH STOCK PRICES ARE

11:04 LARGELY A FUNCTION OF EARNINGS IN INTEREST RATES.

11:08 BUT IF YOU PEG INTEREST RATES AND YOU GET REAL RATES FOR 12

11:12 YEARS, IS NOT SURPRISING YOU'VE HAD AN ENORMOUS EXPANSION IN

11:16 MULTIPLES AND IN THE MARKETS. TOM:

11:22 IF PEOPLE GOT LUCKY AND LATE BUT QUALITY AND LET'S SAY ITS

11:25 IN TECH AND THEY OWN SOME OF THE SEVEN STOCKS, SHOULD THEY

11:26 SELL THEM?

11:29 >> I WOULD BE ADDING A LOT FROM HERE.

11:36 I TRIED TO TELL YOU WHAT I'M DOING MYSELF, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS

11:38 ASK STRATEGIST WHAT THEY ARE DOING WITH THEIR OWN MONEY

11:39 BECAUSE IT CUTS THROUGH THE NONSENSE.

11:43 I HAVE BEEN SOLD A LOT BUT I ALSO HAVE AN ADDED A LOT

11:46 CERTAINLY FROM THE START OF THIS YEAR.

11:51 THAT'S BEEN MY MISTAKE IN THE MARKET IS UP 15% BUT AGAIN, I'M

11:57 A LONG-TERM INVESTOR AND A PROFESSIONAL MONEY MANAGER WITH

12:00 MY OWN MONEY. YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO WORRY

12:03 ABOUT STAYING EMPLOYED. THAT IS A WHOLE OTHER DYNAMIC

12:08 THAT COMES INTO PLAY. FOR THOSE OF A LONGER-TERM TIME

12:15 HORIZON, I WOULD BE CAREFUL ABOUT CHASING PERFORMANCE.

12:20 I WOULD ALSO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THE VALUATIONS AND WHAT YOU

12:21 ARE PAYING AND WHAT THE RISK REWARD LOOKS LIKE FOR THE

12:23 COMPANIES YOU ARE BUYING. BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THERE STILL

12:29 40% OF THE COMPANIES IN THE RUSSELL 2000 THAT HAVE NOT HAD

12:31 A PROFIT IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS. THAT IS SUSTAINABLE WHEN

12:37 INTEREST RATES ARE NEGATIVE IN REAL TERMS. IT IS NOT

12:40 SUSTAINABLE WHEN RATES ARE GOING TO BE POSITIVE IN REAL

12:43 TERMS. WE CAN DEBATE WHETHER THEY ARE POSITIVE IN REAL TERMS

12:47 NOW. ITEM THINK SO BUT WE ARE GETTING THERE AND WE WILL GET

12:52 THERE THAT JUST CHANGES EVERYTHING. JONATHAN:

12:56 WE APPRECIATE YOUR INSIGHT, THANK YOU.

13:01 THE LATEST ON THE MARKETS AND HERE'S THE LATEST ON NATO.

13:08 A GROUP OF UKRAINE KEY ALLIES ARE CLOSING IN ON AGREEMENT TO

13:13 LAUNCH NEGOTIATIONS WITH KYEV ON A COLLECTION OF BILATERAL

13:17 SECURITY COMMITMENTS TO BOLSTER THE COUNTRY TO DEFEND ITSELF.

13:21 THE U.S. AND OTHER PARTICIPATING NATIONS

13:23 WOULD EACH WORK WITH UKRAINE ON SPECIFIC LONG-TERM SECURITY

13:26 COMMITMENTS THROUGH THE PROVISION OF MODERN MILITARY

13:30 EQUIPMENT ACROSS AIR, LAND AND SEA, PRIORITIZING AIR DEFENSE

13:34 SYSTEMS. TOM: THERE IS THE UKRAINE SPECIFIC,

13:39 WHAT WILL WE DO AS ALLIES. I THINK WE WILL HEAR FROM MR.

13:41 STOLTENBERG. I WILL TAKE THE POLARITY HERE

13:45 OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE BALTIC SEA WITH INLAND AND NATO

13:49 WITH SWEDEN ON THE COST OF BEING IN NATO.

13:53 I CANNOT BELIEVE I'M SAYING THAT .

13:55 ITS FOREIGN TO EVERYTHING I WAS EDUCATED ON.

13:58 AS WE GET DOWN TO THE SOUTHERN FRONT AND MR. ERDOGAN'S UNIQUE

14:00 PRESSURES WITH TURKEY. JONATHAN: THAT REPORTING THIS MORNING, WE

14:07 ARE WAITING ON SOME COMMENTS FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE

14:09 UNITED STATES A LONG TIME THE NATO SECRETARY-GENERAL.

14:14 LET'S GET TO AMH ON THE GROUND IN LITHUANIA.

14:21 ANNMARIE: WHAT WE WANT TO HEAR IS FROM

14:23 PRESIDENT BIDEN AND WHAT HE HAS TO SAY REGARDING WHAT HAPPENED

14:26 OVERNIGHT WITHIN THE LAST 20 FOR HOURS.

14:28 WE HAVE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT OUTLOOK ON WHAT WE WILL BE ABLE

14:31 TO SEE COMING OUT OF THIS NATO MEETING.

14:35 THAT IS THAT TURKEY IS PAVING THE WAY FOR SWEDEN TO BE THE

14:38 NEXT MEMBER OF NATO. IT WAS BETWEEN THESE TWO NORDIC

14:44 COUNTRIES ON A DUAL TRACK BUT FINLAND WAS ABLE TO MAKE THE

14:48 ASCENSION PERSON NOW IT LOOKS LIKE SWEDEN WILL ALSO BE ABLE

14:51 TO DO THAT. IT LOOKS LIKE THIS IS

14:54 POTENTIALLY BECAUSE OF F-16S THAT MIGHT BE COMING FROM THE

14:56 UNITED STATES. THIS HAS BEEN WIDELY EXPECTED

14:58 AND THERE IS A LOT OF REPORTING THAT THERE HAS BEEN SOME

15:02 PRESSURE ON BOB MENENDEZ, THE SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY AND

15:05 SHARE OF THE SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE.

15:08 THAT IS ONE KEY TOPIC HERE ON THE GROUND.

15:12 I JUST SPOKE TO THE FINLAND PRESIDENT AND HE WAS SAYING

15:16 THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE RUMORS ARE ABOUT POTENTIALLY FOR THIS

15:18 QUID PRO QUO. THE WHITE HOUSE WILL NOT CALL

15:21 IT THAT BUT LET'S CALL IT WHAT IT IS. THE SECOND TOPIC IS WHAT

15:24 HAPPENS WITH UKRAINE. UKRAINE WANTS TO BECOME A

15:26 MEMBER OF NATO. PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS ALREADY

15:32 SAID THERE IS NOTE UNANIMOUS CONSENSUS ON NATO MEMBERS

15:34 REGARDING WHEN UKRAINE COULD BECOME A MEMBER.

15:38 THERE IS OBVIOUSLY A WAR ON UKRAINIAN TERRITORY.

15:42 THEY WOULD WANT TO BECOME A MEMBER RIGHT DURING THE WAR --

15:45 RIGHT WHEN THE WAR ENDS AND THERE IS CONCERN ABOUT A FROZEN

15:46 CONFLICT.

15:52 WHAT YOU ARE SEEING HERE AND WHAT LEADERS WILL TALK ABOUT IS

15:54 WHAT THE PATH FORWARD IS IN TERMS OF DIALOGUE WITH THE NATO

16:00 ALLIANCE AS WELL AS SOME OF THE SECURITY COMMITMENTS UKRAINE

16:01 WANTS TO SEE FROM THE NATO ALLIANCE.

16:06 JUST LIKE ZELENSKYY MADE THIS PUSH FOR MORE SUPPORT AT THE G7

16:08 IN JAPAN, HE IS GOING TO BE HERE AS WELL AT THE NATO SUMMIT

16:10 TOMORROW. JONATHAN: ONE OUTSTANDING ISSUE IS THE

16:14 PROVISION OF CLUSTER MUNITIONS. WHAT DO YOU HEAR ON THE GROUND

16:17 AS TO WHO IS PUSHING BACK? ANNMARIE:

16:25 ITS DIFFICUL FOR THE LIKES OF FRANCE, GERMANY AND ITALY AND

16:27 SOME OF THESE COUNTRIES THAT HAD SIGNED UP TO A TREATY THAT

16:30 WOULD BAN THE USE OF CLUSTER MUNITIONS.

16:34 WHAT WE CONTINUOUSLY HEAR FROM THE WHITE HOUSE IS THAT RUSSIA

16:40 IS USING THESE BOMBS AND THE FAIL RATE ON THESE BOMBS IS

16:44 MUCH HIGHER IN RUSSIA THAN THE U.S.

16:46 SAYS THE ONES THEY WOULD SEND. JONATHAN:

16:49 YOU CAN SEE THE NATO SECRETARY ALONGSIDE THE PRESIDENT OF THE

16:50 UNITED STATES, LET'S TAKE A LISTEN.

17:00 >> THAT WE STAND BY UKRAINE AND

17:04 ALSO THAT WE AGREE ON THE MESSAGE FOR UKRAINE AND

17:11 MEMBERSHIP FOR UKRAINE.

17:14 A UNITED MESSAGE OF THE PATH FORWARD FOR UKRAINE AND

17:17 MEMBERSHIP FOR UKRAINE.

17:24 ANOTHER MAJOR MESSAGE FROM THIS SUMMIT WILL BE THAT WE NEED TO

17:28 INVEST MORE IN OUR DEFENSE. WE NEED A NEW DEFENSE

17:36 INVESTMENT WHERE WE STAY AT 2% AS A MINIMUM.

17:40 THE EUROPEAN ALLIES ARE STEPPING UP THIS YEAR.

17:45 WE HAVE NEW NUMBER SHOWING THEY HAVE ADDED 8.3% IN REAL TERMS

17:51 FOR PURCHASE AND THIS IS A RECORD HIGH.

17:54 THAT DEMONSTRATES THAT THE ALLIES ARE DELIVERING ON THEIR

17:55 COMMITMENTS. MR. PRESIDENT, ITS GREAT TO

17:58 HAVE YOU HERE AT THE NATO SUMMIT.

18:02 >> ITS GOOD TO BE HERE AND YOU CONTINUE TO DELIVER.

18:09 THAT'S NOT A SURPRISE THAT I BEEN TOUTING THE FACT THAT I

18:12 THINK ITS IMPORTANT AT THIS CRITICAL MOMENT IN THAT NATO

18:17 ISSUE THAT YOU CONTINUE TO LEAD NATO. YOU ARE TRUSTED.

18:22 SHOWING KNOWS THE SITUATION BETTER THAN YOU DO.

18:27 THIS IS AN HISTORIC MOMENT, ADDING FINLAND AND SWEDEN TO

18:30 NATO IS CONSEQUENTIAL. YOUR LEADERSHIP REALLY MATTERS.

18:41 WE AGREE ON THE LANGUAGE THAT WEAKER -- THAT YOU PROPOSED

18:45 RELATIVE TO THE FUTURE OF UKRAINE BEING ABLE TO JOIN NATO.

18:53 WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO BE A UNITED NATO.

18:58 YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY MANY TIMES,

19:01 I STILL THINK PRESIDENT PUTIN STILL THINKS THE SAME ABOUT

19:07 NATO. THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU DO.

19:11 >> THANK YOU. JONATHAN:

19:18 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES ALONGSIDE THE NATO

19:20 SECRETARY-GENERAL, SOME BRIEF COMMENTS THERE.

19:25 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WILL ATTEND THE MEETING

19:28 OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC COUNCIL SO ABOUT 11:00 A.M.

19:32 EASTERN TIME, YOU WILL SEE THE PRESIDENT AND A BILATERAL

19:33 MEETING WITH THE TURKISH PRESIDENT.

19:35 F-16S ARE THE FOCUS FOR MANY OF YOU AND THAT'S THE LATEST THIS

19:41 MORNING. TOM: SOME BARGAINING GOING ON THERE.

19:44 YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE WE WILL GIVE YOU F-16S, ETC.

19:57 THERE IS A LOT OF NUDGE, NUDGE, WINK,WINK GOING ON.

20:00 JULIE NORMAN JOINS US NOW. I WANT TO GO BACK TO THEM AS

20:04 SAID THE CONDOLEEZZA RICE AND ROBERT GATES ROAD AND ROBERT

20:07 GATES WROTE IN THE WASHINGTON POST SIX MONTH AGO.

20:11 THEY TALKED ABOUT WHAT HAS CHANGED HERE IS WITHOUT

20:15 QUESTION UKRAINE HAS PROVEN THAT THEY ARE A DETERMINED

20:20 PARTNER AND HOW THEY ALREADY NOW ARE PART OF NATO EVEN

20:22 THOUGH THEY AWAIT ADMITTANCE.

20:24 >> THAT CERTAINLY WILL BE THE BIG QUESTION FOR NATO THIS NEXT

20:29 TWO DAYS.

20:30 WHAT IS THE NEXT STEP FOR UKRAINE?

20:33 WE JUST HEARD IN A STATEMENT FROM THE PRESIDENT AND FROM

20:36 NATO THAT THERE IS A GENERAL SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE MEMBERSHIP.

20:39 WHAT THAT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE AND WHAT ITS TIMELINE LOOKS

20:43 LIKE IS STILL VERY MUCH IN DEBATED WITHIN NATO.

20:47 AS YOU REFERRED TO, THERE HAS BEEN SOME INDICATIONS UKRAINE

20:52 IS STEPPING UP MEETINGS WITH MILITARY REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE

20:54 EXPECTED BUT BIDEN AND OTHERS STILL HAVE RESERVATIONS ABOUT

20:59 SOME OF THE PATHWAYS FORWARD. THE BIG QUESTION IS HOW TO MOVE

21:03 FORWARD DURING A WAR? FOR JOE BIDEN AND GERMANY AND

21:07 THE OTHER ACTORS, THERE'S A SENSE OF NOT PUSHING THIS

21:10 TIMELINE UP WHILE THE CONFLICT IS ONGOING. LISA:

21:13 IT FEELS LIKE NATO MEMBERS ARE FLIRTING WITH HOW MUCH THEY CAN

21:17 PROVIDE TO UKRAINE WITHOUT CREATING AN ESCALATION TO THE

21:21 WAR OR AN INADVERTENT INCLUSION OF NATO MEMBERS IN THE CONFLICT

21:23 WITH RUSSIA. WHERE IS THAT LINE? >> ITS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN

21:30 DEBATED THROUGHOUT. WE ARE NEVER SURE EXACTLY WHAT

21:33 WILL BE A REDLINE FOR VLADIMIR PUTIN.

21:37 THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN TRYING TO ENSURE THIS

21:40 CONFLICT DOES NOT BECOME WORLD WAR III AND DOES NOT ESCALATE

21:49 FURTHER.

21:50 NATO OBVIOUSLY HAS THE ATTITUDE THAT THAT END ATTACK AGAINST

21:51 ONE IS AN ATTACK AGAINST ALL.

21:59 IF UKRAINE IS BROUGHT INTO NATO WHILE THE WARS GOING ON, WOULD

22:00 THAT CAUSE ALL THE MEMBERS TO BE INVOLVED?

22:03 THAT'S WHERE THE TENSIONS STAND. IF YOU SAY WE WILL DO THIS

22:07 AFTER THE WAR ENDS, THAT GIVES FURTHER INCENTIVE FOR VLADIMIR

22:11 PUTIN TO CONTINUE THE WAR INDEFINITELY. LISA:

22:13 THE WAR HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR ABOUT 18 MONTHS.

22:18 A YEAR AGO AT THE NATO MEETING, PEOPLE SEEMS TO BE VERY UNITED.

22:20 THERE IS A COMMITMENT TO SUPPORT UKRAINE.

22:23 THERE IS A VERY DIFFERENT TONE AT THIS NATIVE MEETING -- AT

22:25 THIS NATO MEETING. HOW MUCH IS THIS POLARIZING

22:34 SOME NATO MEMBERS THAT HAVE HAD ITN UNUSUAL DEGREE OF UNANIMITY

22:35 LAST YEAR?

22:37 >> NATO WILL TRY TO COME OUT OF THE SUMMIT WITH AN EQUAL SENSE

22:44 OF COHESION, UNITY AND WE SEE THAT IS A CRUCIAL MESSAGE TO

22:47 SEND TO VLADIMIR PUTIN IF NO ONE ELSE.

22:50 THERE IS DEFINITELY DIFFERENCES BUT OVER ALL, MOST COUNTRIES

22:52 ARE VERY COMMITTED TO SUPPORTING UKRAINE.

22:56 ITS WHAT EXACTLY THAT SUPPORT LOOKS LIKE, DIFFERENCES IN WHAT

22:59 KIND OF WEAPONS ARE BEING SENT AND WHEN, THE QUESTION OF

23:00 MEMBERSHIP. IN GENERAL, THE IDEA OF

23:05 SUPPORTING UKRAINE IS ONE THAT MOST NATO STATES ARE STRONGLY

23:08 BEHIND TOM: OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF MONTHS,

23:11 WE HAD THE SHOCK OF FINLAND JOINING NATO, MAYBE SWEDEN

23:15 JOINING NATO, MAYBE UKRAINE JOINING NATO.

23:18 THIS IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT MR. PUTIN WANTED. HOW WILL

23:22 HE RESPOND?

23:26 >> ITS ONE REASON THAT I THINK THERE WAS SOME RELUCTANCE

23:28 INITIALLY TO CONSIDER THIS. THE ALLIANCE HAS DECIDED PRETTY

23:34 MUCH THAT IN THE LONG RUN, THIS METHOD -- THIS MAY BE THE BEST

23:36 WAY TO DETER PUTIN. WHAT THAT MEANS FOR PUTIN I

23:40 THINK IS ANYONE'S GUESS.

23:47 WE SAW AFTER THE 2008 NATO MEETING WHICH SUGGESTED THAT

23:48 GEORGIA AND UKRAINE MIGHT HAVE A PATH TO MEMBERSHIP, YOU CAN

23:51 CITE THAT IS WHEN PUTIN STARTED THINKING IN A MORE PUGNACIOUS

23:54 WAY. OTHERS SEE THE EXPANSION IS QUITE NECESSARY SO I THINK THIS

23:58 DEBATE WILL BE ONGOING. JONATHAN:

24:01 THANK YOU FOR YOUR INPUT THIS MORNING.

24:06 ABSENT IN THIS CONVERSATION THIS MORNING AND LAST WEEK IS

24:11 HOW THIS WAR INCLUDES IN UKRAINE. WHAT IS THE PATH?

24:17 TOM: THE REAL FOCAL POINT FOR ME IS

24:20 CLEARLY THE REPORTS OUT OF THE BRITISH PRESS.

24:22 I THINK THEY ARE MORE ON THE SCENE.

24:25 ITS THE WORLD WAR I EQUIVALENT WHERE THEY ARE ARGUING ABOUT 20

24:29 KILOMETERS OF TERRITORY. LISA: PEOPLE IN QUIET CONVERSATIONS

24:34 ARE SAYING IT JUST DRAGS ON AND IS JUST A WAR OF A THAT GOES ON

24:36 FOR A LONG TIME. THAT IS UNFORTUNATE WHAT NATO

24:41 MEMBERS ARE KIND OF COUNTING ON BECAUSE PUTIN WILL NOT JUST

24:42 GIVE UP. HOW DO YOU SUPPORT A NATION

24:48 WHILE THEY ARE DEALING WITH SOMETHING THAT IS WORLD WAR I

24:51 EQUIVALENT WITH A WORLD THAT'S MOVED ONTO DIFFERENT TYPES OF

24:53 WAR METHODOLOGIES? JONATHAN: ITS GONE ON FOR LONGER THAN

24:58 PEOPLE ANTICIPATED 12 MONTHS AGO. WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM, OUR

25:02 COVERAGE ON NATO WILL CONTINUE. THAT SUMMIT IS TAKING PLACE IN

25:05 LITHUANIA THIS MORNING. WE WILL CATCH UP THIS MORNING.

25:11 DAVID PAGES COMING UP SHORTLY AND WE NEED TO RESET AND LOOK

25:14 AHEAD TO THE DATA THIS WEEK. CPI, PPI AND THE INFLATION

25:21 STUFF AND ONTO EARNINGS FOR BANKS ON FRIDAY.

25:22 MANY PEOPLE ARE EXPECTING SOME INCREASE IN LUNG LOST RESERVES

25:25 AT SOME OF THESE BANKS. THEY MAY BE WRITING UP SOME

25:28 LOANS AS WELL. WILL WE GET SOME INSIGHT INTO

25:32 THE CRACKS PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT? TOM: RIGHT DOWN TO THE SUPER

25:39 REGIONALS AND THEN REGIONALS AND ALL THE DEBRIS OFF OF SVB,

25:43 IS NOT JUST ONE SET OF BANK EARNINGS THIS TIME AROUND. LISA:

25:47 I THINK IF THEY SHOW SOME KIND OF RETRACEMENT OR SOME SORT OF

25:53 INCREASED REQUIREMENTS FROM REGULATORY ACTION, WHAT DOES

25:54 THAT DO IN TERMS OF SETTING THE TONE FOR THE REST OF EARNINGS?

25:59 JONATHAN: THAT WILL SET THE TONE FOR THE

26:01 FEDERAL RESERVE. JOHN WILLIAMS IS SPEAKING TO

26:04 THE FINANCIAL TIMES, I'D ON HAVE A RECESSION IN MY

26:06 FORECAST, I'VE PRETTY SLOW GROWTH.

26:11 THE MORE THESE GUYS TALK, THE MORE REVEALING THAT SPLINTERING

26:12 ON THE COMMITTEE IS BECOMING. TOM:

26:18 ABSOLUTELY AND WE HAVE SIX FED SPEAKERS TODAY? LISA:

26:21 I HAVE BEEN SEEN IT AS MUCH AS YESTERDAY. TOM:

26:27 THEY ARE ALL RECOVERING FROM THE HOME RUN DERBY. JONATHAN:

26:47 JONATHAN: EQUITIES ARE ATTACHED POSITIVE

26:51 THIS MORNING.

26:53 ON THE NASDAQ, POSITIVE BY 0.1%. ON THE S&P 500, SNAPPING A

26:59 THREE-DAY LOSING STREAK WITH THE RUSSELL UP BY 0.2%.

27:06 THE TWO YEAR YIELD IS DOWN FOR A THIRD CONSECUTIVE SESSION BY

27:09 ABOUT TWO OR THREE BASIS POINTS. BACKING AWAY FROM THE HIGHS OF

27:17 THURSDAY'S SESSION. THAT'S QUITE A SWING IN THIS

27:19 BOND MARKET. THE 10 YEAR BREAKS BELOW 4%

27:23 AGAIN. TOM:

27:33 ITS COMING BACK IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS BUT TO ME, THIS

27:40 IS AN EBBING BEFORE THE KEY INFLATION POINT TOMORROW.

27:46 JONATHAN: LISA'S FAVORITE CURRENCY PAIR

27:51 COMING UP, THE EURO AGAINST THE DOLLAR, RECLAIMING .10.

27:54 THIS IS FOR CONSECUTIVE DAYS OF EURO STRENGTH. LISA:

27:58 AND ITS ON THE HEELS OF SOME PERSISTENT DOLLAR WE AS.

28:02 ITS BEEN NOTICEABLE THIS WEEK GIVEN THE FACT THAT IT HAS COME

28:07 IN TANDEM WITH LOWER FRONT AND YIELDS OVER THE PAST FEW

28:10 SESSIONS BUT PEOPLE ARE INCREASING THEIR EXPECTATIONS

28:12 FOR RATE HIKES. THE FED SPEAKERS COULD HAVE A

28:15 MORE HAWKISH TONE BUT THE MARKET IS NOT BUYING IT OVER

28:17 THE LONGER TERM. THEY DO NOT BELIEVE WHAT THE

28:20 FED IS SAYING CONSISTENTLY WHICH IS READING A LITTLE BIT

28:24 OF AN ISSUE. JONATHAN: WE WERE GOING TO TALK ABOUT FED

28:28 SPEAKERS BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO MOVE ON TOWARD WHAT'S

28:29 DEVELOPING IN THE U.K. ITS INTERESTING TO SEE STERLING

28:35 AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR, BELOW .30.

28:44 A STRONGER PAIR AND ON BACK OF THIS WAGE GROWTH DATA WHICH IS

28:46 STUBBORNLY PERSISTENT FOR THE BANK OF ENGLAND SPECIFICALLY

28:51 BECAUSE OF YOUR RECEIVING THOSE PAY RISES, I'M SURE YOU.

28:53 WANT TO GIVE THEM UP EVEN THOUGH THE GOVERNMENT WOULD

28:54 LIKE YOU TO. TOM: WE'VE GOT THE PERFECT GUESTS

28:56 FOR THIS RIGHT NOW. DAVID PAGE JOINS US AND WE WILL

28:59 DIVE INTO THIS. FOR THE AMERICAN AUDIENCE, THE

29:04 FOREIGNNESS OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.

29:07 I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE UNIVERSITY OF YORK.

29:11 I'M SURE YOU STAGGER THROUGH FOUNDATIONS OF ECONOMIC HISTORY

29:23 AND SOME IN THERE WAS A TEEN - KEYNESIAN SENSE THAT THE LABOR

29:25 SHOULD SACRIFICE THEIR WAGE GRAINS FOR THE GOOD OF THE

29:27 COUNTRY? IS THAT A UNIQUE BRITISH ASPECT?

29:36 >> I THINK ITS SOMETHING THAT IS BELIEVED FROM THE BANK OF

29:37 ENGLAND AND THE CHANCELLOR OF ENGLAND.

29:44 IT SUGGESTS WE ARE GETTING A BACKGROUND WHERE POTENTIALLY

29:46 THE GOVERNMENT IS FACED WITH THE PROSPECT OF WHAT IT WILL

29:49 SET FOR PAY. THERE IS A BELIEF IT WILL

29:53 IGNORE THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND ADVOCATE

29:56 SOMETHING A LITTLE LOWER. WHEN THEY ARE ADVOCATING WAGE

30:04 RESTRAINT, THEY ARE SETTING THE BACKDROP FOR PERHAPS FORCING

30:05 THAT RESTRAINT ON THE PUBLIC SECTOR.

30:08 WHAT WE ARE NOT SEEING IN THE U.K.'S ANY SIGNS OF THAT

30:11 RESTRAINT, JUST A SLIGHT SOFTENING AND THE MONTHLY

30:14 NUMBERS THAT ARE STILL TOO HIGH FOR THE BANK OF ENGLAND. TOM:

30:20 ITS 2023 AND IT FEELS LIKE A CONVERSATION FROM 1974.

30:22 ITS ABSOLUTELY BIZARRE. LISA: OR PERHAPS MARIE ANTOINETTE

30:26 TIMES, LET THEM EAT CAKE.

30:33 NO ONE IS REALLY GOING TO SAY -- WERE YOU THERE? TOM:

30:36 YEAH, THE STREETS WERE MUDDY. LISA:

30:41 I WONDER IF THIS IS UNREALISTIC AND MEET IN DEPTH GETTING THE

30:46 BANK OF ENGLAND HAVING TO RAISE RATES MORE THAN THEY PREVIOUSLY

30:48 EXPECTED, RAISING INTO WEAKNESS. PERHAPS THIS IS NOT WHAT

30:52 MARKETS ARE EXPECTING IF THE POUND IS GAINING.

30:56 HOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE MARKET RESPONSE TO WHAT SEEMS

30:58 TO BE A NECESSITY TO HIKE INTO MORE WEAKNESS?

31:02 >> I THINK YOU ARE SEEING THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE SEE FROM

31:04 THE U.S. AFFECT WHICH YOU TOUCHED ON

31:08 PREVIOUSLY. WHEN THE FED IS TIGHTENING NOW,

31:11 MARKETS ARE STARTING TO TRADE HIGHER IN THE SHORT TERM.

31:14 THEN WE ARE MORE LIKELY TO SEE RATE CUTS BUT THAT'S NOT THE

31:19 CASE FOR THE U.K. IS A AGGRESSIVE MOVE IN THE

31:23 BANK OF ENGLAND NOT JUST FOR THE NEXT MEETING BUT INTO EARLY

31:26 NEXT YEAR AND ITS THAT PROLONGED EFFECT THAT'S CAUSING

31:27 SOME CONCERN. FOR STERLING, THAT'S GREAT.

31:36 THAT'S HELPING TO PUSH CABLE UP TO THESE ONE DOLLAR 30 SENT

31:37 LEVELS BUT THE REALITY IS PROBABLY DIFFERENT.

31:42 THE BANK OF ENGLAND HAD JUST ASKED THEM ABOUT A YEAR AGO,

31:48 THEY PUSHED BACK AGAINST MARKET EXPECTATIONS WHICH WERE LOWER

31:50 THAN THE RIGHTLY OR THE MOMENT. NOW MARKETS ARE ONCE AGAIN

31:53 TESTING THAT. WHEN WE HEAR THE BANK OF

31:58 ENGLAND SPEAK IN EARLY AUGUST, THEY WILL AGAIN BE READY

32:01 RETICENT TO SUGGEST THEY WILL FULFILL MARKET EXPECTATIONS AND

32:05 RATE HIKES AT 6.5%. THEY ALSO HAVE TO HIKE RATES BY

32:11 50 BASIS POINTS LIKE THE LAST MEETING BECAUSE OF CONCERNS

32:13 THAT INFLATION EXPECTATIONS ARE STARTING TO PICK UP MORE.

32:16 CLEARLY, THE BANK IS MORE WORK TO DO AND THAT'S WITH THE LABOR

32:20 MARKET IS SUGGESTING BUT THE CONCERNS THAT INFLATION

32:24 EXPECTATIONS COULD BECOMING UNANCHORED AND COULD LEAD TO

32:26 PERSISTENT INFLATION IN THE U.K.'S SOMETHING THE MARKETS

32:27 ARE SEEING. THEY MIGHT HAVE TO RAISE RATES

32:33 FOR A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD OF TIME. LISA:

32:36 EVERYONE SAYS THE U.K. IS UNIQUE IN THE SITUATION OF

32:40 INFLATION IS DIFFERENT THAN THE UNITED STATES WHERE YOU ARE

32:43 SEEING DISINFLATION COME THROUGH IN DIFFERENT SECTORS.

32:45 HOW DIFFERENT IS IT AT A TIME WHEN WAGE GROWTH IS SURPRISING

32:49 TO THE UPSIDE IN THE U.S. AS WELL?

32:51 >> I WOULD SAY NOT THAT DIFFERENT.

32:56 THE IDIOSYNCRASIES AND SOME OF THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO

33:00 LABOR SUPPLY AND AROUND IMMIGRATION POST-BREXIT AND THE

33:05 CONCERNS AROUND ACTIVITY GIVEN THE DIFFICULTIES THAT STILL IS

33:08 LEADING TO A LOT OF INACTIVITY.

33:14 THERE ARE IDIOSYNCRATIC SUPPLY-SIDE ISSUES BUT

33:15 FUNDAMENTALLY, YOU GOT A LABOR MARKET THIS STILL LOOKS TOO

33:18 TIGHT EVEN IF THERE ARE SOME NASCENT SIGNS OF IT MOVING IN

33:23 THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND THAT'S WAITING -- AND THAT'S CREATING

33:24 WAGE GROWTH. THE LEGS WILL PROBABLY EXTEND

33:30 RELATIVE TO WHEN THE LAST TIMING CYCLE WAS AND THAT'S

33:34 REFLECTED IN THE DIFFICULT COMPOSITION OF MORTGAGE RATES

33:36 SO THAT COMPLICATES THE ISSUE. WE HAVE AN ECONOMY THAT'S BEEN

33:43 IMPACTED BY SUPPLY SHOCKS AND THEN HAS A SUPERHEATED LABOR

33:46 MARKET, MORE BECAUSE OF SUPPLY SHOCKS THEN DEMAND BUT THE BANK

33:50 OF ENGLAND DOZEN HAVE THE LUXURY TO DISTINGUISH AND

33:52 THAT'S CAUSING A RISK OF PERSISTENT INFLATION.

33:54 THAT'S THE STORY THAT JAY POWELL HAS TALKED ABOUT THE

33:57 LAST 12 MONTHS. THE TIMING IS SLIGHTLY

33:59 DIFFERENT. JONATHAN: THE MORTGAGE MARKET IN THE U.K.

34:04 IS SO DIFFERENT RELATIVE TO HERE IN THE UNITED STATES.

34:08 IN THE U.S., YOU HAVE THE BEAUTIFUL OPTION THAT WHEN

34:09 RATES ARE LOW, YOU CAN LOCK THEM IN FOR 30 YEARS BUT THEY

34:13 STRUGGLED TO DO THAT IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND SOME OF

34:15 THOSE MORTGAGES WILL BE UP FOR RE-MORTGAGING.

34:21 WHEN IS THE TIME HORIZON FOR WHEN THAT STARTS TO BITE FOR

34:23 PEOPLE WHO HAVE MORTGAGES AND FOR THE U.K. ECONOMY?

34:28 >> I THINK IT WILL SHOW UP BY THE END OF THE YEAR AND IT WILL

34:34 BE A STORY GOING FURTHER FORWARD AND BE THROUGHOUT 2024

34:38 AND INTO 2025 AS WELL. AT THE SAME TIME, MORTGAGE

34:44 HOLDERS ARE BECOMING LESS IMPORTANT PART OF THE ECONOMY,

34:50 FEWER HOMEOWNERS AND FEWER FIRST-TIME HOMEOWNERS SO THAT

34:52 MAY MITIGATE SOME OF THE EFFECT THAT THERE IS ALSO A BIG MARKET

34:55 IN THE U.S. ITS UNCLEAR HOW MUCH THESE

34:58 INCREASES WILL FEED THROUGH. PRIVATE LANDLORDS ARE

35:04 INCREASING RENTS SO YOU MIGHT SEE INCREASES THAT WOULD HAVE

35:05 BEEN EXPECTED BEFORE THIS. WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE BANK IS

35:10 IT IS ALWAYS BEEN A DIFFERENT MARKET.

35:13 CERTAINLY COMPARED TO THE U.S. BUT FOR THE BANK OF ENGLAND,

35:16 ITS A DIFFERENT MARKET THAN THEY SAW BEFORE THE GSE IN THE

35:19 EARLY 2000S. THIS IS SOME OF THE COMPLICATIONS.

35:26 THEY HAVE TO GAUGE HOW MOORISH MORE -- HOW MUCH MORE THE LAGS

35:30 ARE AND HOW MUCH MORE THEY NEED TO TIGHTEN BEFORE THEY START TO

35:32 SEE THE EFFECT OF WHAT HAS ALREADY GONE THROUGH. JONATHAN:

35:36 APOLLO PUT OUT A PIECE LAST WEEK ON HOW RETICENT THE U.S.

35:39 ECONOMY WAS.

35:45 PS WYATT'S TAKING THE FED DISH HE ASKED WISE TAKING THE FED SO

35:48 LONG TO SLOW DOWN THE ECONOMY. YOU MADE THE POINT ABOUT U.S.

35:53 HOUSEHOLDS. 30 YEAR MORTGAGES ARE LESS

36:00 SENSITIVE TO FED HIKES SO HOW SENSITIVE IS THE U.K.

36:01 ECONOMY TO WHAT THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS DOING?

36:05 >> MORE THAN THE U.S. BUT LESS THAN IT WAS IN SOME OF

36:10 THE FEATURES THAT YOU REFER TO LIKE THE HOUSEHOLD SAVINGS

36:12 ISSUE COMES THROUGH HERE. WE HAVE SEEN DIFFERENT ELEMENTS

36:14 OF FISCAL STIMULUS. THE PANDEMIC CREATED A FISCAL

36:18 STIMULUS THAT BECAME THE EXCESS SAVINGS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE

36:23 ATLANTIC. MORE RECENTLY HERE AS WE SEE

36:26 HIGH ENERGY PRICES, THE U.K. GOVERNMENT CHOSE TO PROVIDE

36:30 BLANKET FISCAL STIMULUS TO TRY AND MINIMIZE SOME OF THE IMPACT

36:33 OF THE HIGH INFLATION ITSELF RATHER THAN TARGET IT.

36:37 IN SOME WAYS, THE FISCAL STIMULUS OFFSETS THE IMPACT

36:39 COMING THROUGH FROM BANK TIGHTENING.

36:44 I THINK THAT LEVEL OF BUFFER IN THE HOUSEHOLD SECTOR AND IN THE

36:47 CORPORATE SECTOR IS ALSO APPLICABLE BUT NOT TO THE SAME

36:49 DEGREE BUT FOR THE U.K. TOM: WE ASSUME THERE IS VARIOUS AND

36:55 SUNDRY DISINFLATION'S WHETHER ITS AMERICA OR WHATEVER.

37:02 WHAT IS THE MOST EFFICACIOUS DISINFLATION?

37:03 HOW DO YOU HAVE A GOOD INFLATION?

37:06 >> I THINK THE SUPPLY-SIDE IMPROVEMENTS ARE BENIGN

37:09 INFLATION. WE ARE SEEING THAT COMING

37:11 THROUGH AN ENERGY. IN THE LEG STRUCTURE OF HOW

37:19 THIS FEEDS THROUGH.

37:25 WE JUMP SEE THE PETROL PRICE INCREASE BUT THE WAY IT PASSES

37:27 THROUGH UTILITY PRICES. ENERGY IS THE MOST BENIGN OF

37:33 THESE ISSUES WITH ENERGY PRICES COMING OFF BENIGN INFLATION.

37:37 WE LOST THAT COMING THROUGH THE EASING OF GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN

37:39 PRIZES AND THAT SHOULD BE IMPACTING LOCAL GOODS.

37:46 WE SHOULD SEE SOME IMPROVEMENT COMING THROUGH OVER THE COURSE

37:47 OF THIS YEAR. ALL OF THESE ARE BENIGN

37:52 DISINFLATION'S. THE LESS BENIGN WHEN YOU HAVE

37:57 TO CRIMP GAINS IN THE LABOR MARKET SO THAT WE DO SEE

38:02 PASS-THROUGH SERVICE INFLATION BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT UNDERPINS

38:04 CORE INFLATION WHICH IS TOO HIGH IN THE U.S.

38:05 AND TO HIKE IN THE U.K. JONATHAN:

38:11 DAVID PAGE, WE APPRECIATE IT, THANK YOU.

38:19 GOING BACK AND FORTH WITH GUY JOHNSON TO SOME NUMBERS WE WERE

38:21 BOTH DISCUSSING OVER THE LAST WEEK OR SO.

38:28 CURRENT INTEREST RATES WITH SAVERS EARNING 29 BILLION

38:32 STERLING MORE THIS YEAR THAN NOVEMBER OF 2021 BEFORE THEY

38:33 STARTED HIKING INTEREST RATES. MORTGAGE BORROWERS ARE PAYING

38:37 MORE IN DEBT INTEREST. BORROWERS ARE PAYING 14 BILLION

38:42 AND YOU CAN DO THE MATH. THIS TIME MENTION OF THAT

38:48 ANALYSIS, AN EXTRA DIMENSION. IF YOU ARE A SAVER, YOU DUMB

38:53 HAVE THE HEIGHT MARGINAL PROPENSITY TO SPEND IN THE SAME

38:56 WAY -- YOU DOWN TO HAVE THE HEIGHT MARGINAL PROPENSITY TO

38:58 SPEND IN THE SAME WAY. I DO THINK ITS AS OBVIOUS IN

39:01 THE U.K. TOM:

39:08 I AGREE, I DID WORK THIS MORNING ON A MORTGAGE AND IF

39:14 YOU HAD A 4% MORTGAGE RATE OR 7.31%, WITH THE SAME PAYMENT,

39:18 YOU CAN BUY 1/3 LESS.

39:24 JONATHAN: GO ON STREET EASY AND PICK AN

39:28 APARTMENT IN NEW YORK CITY, ANY APARTMENT AND YOU CAN REENTER

39:30 WITH THE MORTGAGE RATE WOULD BE AND TAKE IT DOWN FROM SEVEN AND

39:33 WORK OUT WHAT YOUR MONTHLY PAYMENT WOULD BE A COUPLE OF

39:35 YEARS AGO. THIS MARKET IS RADICALLY

39:40 DIFFERENT BASED ON YOUR MONTHLY PAYMENT AND WHAT IT WOULD HAVE

39:42 BEEN SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND WHAT IT IS NOW. LISA:

39:48 TO TOM'S POINT, THAT MEANS THAT HOUSING PRICES HAVE TO COME

39:49 DOWN IN ORDER TO MAKE PEOPLE WANT TO PAY THAT.

39:55 THAT'S THE THEORY BUT IT DOES WORK BECAUSE THERE ARE NO HOMES

39:56 AVAILABLE FOR SALE BECAUSE NO ONE WANTS TO GET A 4% MORTGAGE

40:00 AND SUDDENLY PEOPLE HAVE TONS OF CASH TO SPEND IS THEY ARE

40:05 SAVING AND IT DID WORK THAT WAY. TOM:

40:08 JONATHAN MILLER IS SCHEDULED TO BE WITH US AND HE'S THE EXPERT.

40:13 HE HAS AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE BEHAVIOR GOING ON IN THIS

40:17 DYNAMIC. JONATHAN: ITS SO. TOM: ODD BARELY DESCRIBES IT.

40:20 THIS IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I REMEMBER LAST TIME WHEN

40:22 IT WAS 8%. LISA: THIS IS THE REASON WHY IT HARD

40:27 TO UNDERSTAND DISINFLATION. WE DO UNDERSTAND HOW QUICKLY

40:31 HOUSING PRICES WELCOME DOWN OR RENTAL COME DOWN FOR IF THEY

40:32 WILL. ANY MARGINAL DECLINES, DOES

40:37 THAT SET US UP FOR OTHER HIGHS? THAT'S THE TENSION IN THE U.S.

40:41 AS THEY SAY TO DIFFERENT STORY THAN WHAT'S GOING ON ELSEWHERE.

40:43 TOM: I THINK WE ARE SHADED BY THREE

40:45 ZIP CODES. LISA: MEANING?

40:47 TOM: NATIONWIDE, RENTS ARE COMING

40:50 DOWN. LISA: USED CAR JONATHAN: PRICES ARE COMING DOWN AS WELL.

40:57 JONATHAN: SOME REPORTING FROM AXIOS THERE

41:00 YESTERDAY.

41:17 >> THESE CHANGES WOULD INCREASE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OVERALL

41:18 BUT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THEY WOULD SIMPLY RAISE CAPITAL

41:22 REQUIREMENTS FOR THE LARGEST, MOST COMPLEX BANKS.

41:26 WE INTEND TO CONSIDER COMMENTS AIRILY AND ANY CHANGES WOULD BE

41:28 IMPLEMENTED WITH APPROPRIATE PHASES. JONATHAN:

41:32 THE FED VICE CHAIR FOR SUPERVISION SPEAKING OF BANK

41:35 REGULATION. EARNINGS SEASON IS KICKING OFF

41:38 FRIDAY WITH JP MORGAN, CITIBANK AND WELLS FARGO.

41:41 THROUGH NEXT WEEK, BANK OF AMERICA, MORGAN STANLEY AND

41:46 GOLDMAN SACHS ON JULY 19. TOM: WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR THERE?

41:53 THEY ARE ALL ENEMIES AND I GET THAT BUT WE LOOK AT THE

41:55 DYNAMICS OF JP MORGAN AND THEIR TROUBLES ON THE BALANCE SHEET

42:05 BUT THE BASIC TONE I GET IS WALL STREET, , ITS A STRUGGLE.

42:09 TO SAY THE LEAST. I WONDER WHAT WE WILL HEAR. LISA:

42:15 I AM LOOKING AT THE IDEA THAT SUDDENLY MICHAEL BARR WANTS TO

42:18 RAISE THE CAPITAL ARM IS ON BIG BANKS AND SAID NOTHING ABOUT

42:22 THE SUPERVISION FUNCTION OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND HOW TO

42:24 BOLSTER THAT AND SAID NOTHING ABOUT THE REGIONAL BANKS WHICH

42:27 WERE THE PROBLEM IN THE PREVIOUS ITERATION.

42:30 HOW DO WE GET THIS TO TRANSLATE INTO A VERY DELICATE POLITICAL

42:33 DANCE? JP DIMON HAS NOT BEEN TALKING

42:40 BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE BEHIND THE SCENES, HE IS PROBABLY SAYING

42:41 THIS WILL NOT DO ANYTHING. TOM: WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO

42:45 ACCOMPLISH HERE? WE WILL GET A BRIEF ON THIS.

42:52 MYRA RODRIGUEZ JOINS US NOW.

42:59 A REAL EXPERT ON BASEL THREE, DODD-FRANK AND THE REST. I AM

43:06 LOST. WE HAD BASEL THREE, DODD-FRANK AND THAT HAD

43:09 BASICALLY NOTHING TO DO WITH HELPING US WITH THE SVB

43:10 DISASTER.

43:18 HOW DO WE REGULATE OR SUPERVISE IMPROVEMENT SO THERE IS NOT

43:19 ANOTHER SVB?

43:24 >> THE CRITICAL THING TO REMEMBER HERE IS THAT THERE WAS

43:26 SOME VERY IMPORTANT COMPONENTS BOTH IN BASEL THREE AND

43:31 DODD-FRANK THAT WERE REMOVED FOR BANKS THE SIZE OF SILICON

43:35 VALLEY BANK ON AND FIRST REPUBLIC.

43:40 UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, A LAW WAS PASSED, THE ECONOMIC

43:44 GROWTH REGULATORY RELIEF CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT.

43:49 THAT STATED IN TITLE IV THAT THOSE BANKS THAT WERE UNDER

43:52 $250 BILLION WERE NOT SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT.

43:57 THERE WERE A LOT OF GOOD PROVISIONS IN DODD-FRANK IN

43:58 BASEL THREE THAT WOULD HAVE APPLIED TO THOSE BANKS AND THAT

44:01 UNFORTUNATELY WAS REVOKED. YOU CORRECTLY POINTED OUT

44:06 REGULATION AND SUPERVISION. WHAT REALLY NEEDS TO HAPPEN

44:12 HERE IS THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE RESOURCES AND MORE

44:17 ATTENTION DEDICATED TO WHAT EXACTLY IS GOING ON IN THE

44:21 EXAMINATION PROCESS AT THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ESPECIALLY

44:23 BUT ALSO THE OCC. TOM: THE THING I DONE UNDERSTAND IS

44:28 AFTER WHAT WE ALL WENT THROUGH SIX MONTHS OF NO, FIVE MONTHS

44:32 OF NO, LET'S FIX IT. IS THERE ANY THRUST TO BRING

44:38 BACK THE ORIGINAL BASEL THREE AND DODD-FRANK?

44:41 >> BASEL THREE HAS LONG EXISTED IN THE UNITED STATES IS PART OF

44:45 THE BASEL THREE BANKING SUPERVISION. U.S.

44:48 ALWAYS OPINES ON THESE RULES.

44:54 THERE HAVE BEEN ADDITIONAL TIGHTENING RECOMMENDATIONS OVER

44:55 THE BASEL COMMITTEE AND THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE REFER TO AS THE

44:57 ENDGAME. THE BIG BANKS ARE BEING ALLOWED

45:01 TO USE MODELS TO MEASURE THEIR CREDIT RISK.

45:05 THEY HAVE WAY TOO MUCH FLEXIBILITY TO DO THAT SO THERE

45:10 ARE SOME GOOD THINGS THAT BARR IS RECOMMENDING.

45:14 I'M CONCERNED THAT WE NEED TO HEAR SPECIFICS ABOUT WHAT WILL

45:20 HAPPEN WITH IMPROVEMENT ON THE REGIONAL BANKS.

45:23 THOSE WERE THE BANKS THAT AGAIN NEED TO BE DESIGNATED AS

45:27 DOMESTICALLY SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT AS THEY WERE UNDER

45:28 DODD-FRANK TITLE I. THAT PART WAS REVOKED UNDER THE

45:31 TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. WE ALSO NEED TO HEAR

45:35 SPECIFICALLY ABOUT SUPERVISION. HOW WILL THE BANK EXAMINERS

45:40 REALLY BE EMPOWERED TO DO THEIR JOB? YOU READ THE DOCUMENTS THAT

45:45 WERE RELEASED, THE ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS THAT WERE RELEASED

45:50 WITH THE BARR REPORT AND THOSE ARE MORE INTERESTING THAN THE

45:55 BARR REPORT SUBSEQUENTLY BECAUSE YOU SEE THE COMMENT

45:56 FROM THE EXAMINERS. THEY DID THEIR JOB BUT WAS

46:00 THERE MIDDLE MANAGEMENT INTERVENTION OR SENIOR

46:03 MANAGEMENT INTERVENTION? WE HAVE AND HEARD THAT YET AND

46:06 THERE NEEDS TO BE AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION OF

46:07 WHAT HAPPENED THERE. LISA: WE KNOW WHAT THE QUESTIONS

46:12 AREN'T PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ASKING THEM FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS.

46:15 WHAT WE HEARD FROM MICHAEL BARTH WAS NOT THAT YESTERDAY.

46:22 WAS THIS -- IS THIS A FIG LEAF OVER THE ISSUES OF BANKING

46:25 SUPERVISION AND WHETHER THEY WILL INCREASE REGULATORY

46:27 CAPITAL FOR THE SMALLER BANKS, A POLITICAL HOT POTATO THAT NO

46:32 ONE WANTS TO ADDRESS, INSTEAD FOCUSING ON THE HARD QUESTIONS

46:36 THAT MAY YIELD SOME UNCOMFORTABLE ANSWERS?

46:39 >> UNFORTUNATE, THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE TO DO

46:41 BOTH THINGS AT THE SAME TIME. THAT OF COURSE CAN BE QUITE

46:44 CHALLENGING.

46:51 BASEL THREE ENDGAME, THOSE REVISIONS HAVE BEEN ONGOING,

46:56 THOSE DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN -- HAPPENED WAY BEFORE SILICON

46:58 VALLEY BANK SO THAT’'S WHAT MICHAEL OR FOCUSED ON YESTERDAY.

47:02 OF COURSE WE NEED RESILIENT GLOBALLY SYSTEMIC IMPORTANT

47:05 BANKS. HOWEVER, THE NEXT STEP HAS TO

47:07 BE FOCUSING ON THE REGIONAL BANKS AND IT HAS TO BE FOCUSING

47:10 ON SUPERVISION. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO EMPOWER

47:16 THAT WHATEVER THE BANK EXAMINERS FIND, THAT THAT MAKES

47:22 IT ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP AND IT BANKS ARE NOT LIQUID, THAT'S

47:26 THE REAL ISSUE HERE, SVB, FIRST SIGNATURE, THEY WERE NOT LIQUID.

47:29 WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT NO MATTER HOW MUCH DODD-FRANK OR

47:34 BASEL III YOU HAVE, THAT'S NOT GOING TO PREVENT BAD BEHAVIOR

47:36 AT SOME OF THESE BANKS. LOOK AT WELLS FARGO NOW,

47:41 PREDATORY LENDING PRACTICES AGAINST AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND

47:42 LATINOS. YOU CAN STRENGTHEN CAPITAL ALL

47:48 YOU WANT THAT BAD BEHAVIOR IS NOT GOING TO BE ADDRESSED.

47:52 YOU STILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH REMUNERATION OF THE EXECUTIVES.

47:55 YOU CAN HAVE A SITUATION WHERE HIT -- YOU HAVE -- WHERE YOU

48:01 HAVE AN SVB CEO PART OF THE IMPLOSION OF THE BANK AND RUNS

48:04 OFF TO HAWAII FOR A BONUS. TOM: THE WHOLE THING IS AS SIMPLE AS

48:10 THIS -- WE ALSO THE CRISIS WE LIVED.

48:14 NONE OF THIS HELPS PROTECT US FROM THE CRISIS. NOTHING.

48:22 LISA: A LOT OF THE NEW REQUIREMENTS

48:25 CAME OUT AFTER 2008 AND SOME OF THEM DID AND APPLIED TO THE

48:30 REGIONAL BANKS. IS IT OVER?

48:32 HAVE WE SEEN THE END TO THE TURMOIL WE SAW IN MARCH?

48:38 >> I DOPE THINK SO, UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE EVEN

48:40 THOUGH THE FED HAS TEMPORARILY CAUSED, WE ARE STILL AT VERY

48:44 ELEVATED INTEREST RATES WHICH MEANS HIGH COST OF BORROWING

48:45 FOR THESE REGIONAL BANKS. YOU STILL HAVE INFLATIONARY

48:50 PRESSURES IN THE U.K. AND CONTINENTAL EUROPE SO THOSE

48:53 BANKS OF RAISE RATES MORE RECENTLY.

48:57 YOU DO HAVE THOSE TROUBLE SPOTS AHEAD.

49:02 YOU HAVE RISING DEFAULT RATES AND -- IN THE CREDIT CARD AREA

49:04 AND AUTO LOANS AND COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE AND I THINK WE WILL

49:07 SEE SOME OF THAT THIS COMING FRIDAY WITH BANK EARNINGS.

49:10 ALL THE BIG BANKS INCLUDING J.P. MORGAN, THEY ALL RAISED THEIR

49:15 -- THEIR LOAN LOSS PROVISIONS LAST ORDERS OF THE NEW THERE

49:18 WAS THESE TROUBLING TIMES AHEAD. UNFORTUNATELY, THE REGIONAL

49:24 BANKS WILL BE THE ONES THAT WILL BEAR THE BRUNT OF RISING

49:28 DEFAULT ESPECIALLY IN THE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE AREA

49:35 BECAUSE THEIR PORTFOLIOS ALLOCATED TO COMMERCIAL REAL

49:39 ESTATE ARE LARGER THAN A JP MORGAN OR BANK OF AMERICA AND

49:40 THOSE BANKS ARE MUCH MORE DIVERSIFIED.

49:44 YOU MENTIONED EARLIER GOLDMAN SACHS AND MORGAN STANLEY.

49:48 THOSE ESSENTIALLY ARE STILL PRIMARILY INVESTMENT BANKS,

49:50 SECURITIES FIRMS, SO THEY DO AND IF IT FROM THE BUSINESS

49:55 LINE DIVERSITY THAT JP MORGAN AND BANK OF AMERICA HAVE.

49:59 THEY HAVE ASSET MANAGEMENT, THE ACTUAL BANK AND CITIES SO THESE

50:02 RISING TO FULL RATES WILL IMPACT EVERYBODY BUT I THINK

50:06 THEY WILL SEE THE VOLATILITY IN THE MARKET AND THAT WILL HURT

50:10 THOSE BANKS THAT ARE LESS DIVERSIFIED THAN A JP MORGAN.

50:14 UNFORTUNATELY, THAT MEANS GOLDMAN SACHS COME MORGAN

50:17 STANLEY AND THE REGIONAL BANKS, THEY DO HAVE THE ASSET

50:22 MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT BANKING LIKE THE LARGEST GLOBALLY

50:25 SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT BANKS. JONATHAN:

50:29 WE WILL SEE HOW THAT DEVELOPS ON FRIDAY.

50:31 THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH US.

50:33 THAT'S THE LATEST WITH THE BANKS.

50:37 WE'VE GOT TO PUSH AHEAD TO BANK EARNINGS FRIDAY AND ECONOMIC

50:42 DATA WHICH KICKS OFF TOMORROW AND WE WILL PROVIDE YOU

50:44 COVERAGE OF THE NATO SUMMIT IN LITHUANIA.

50:47 WE WILL CATCH UP ON THAT IN A LITTLE BIT.

50:55 THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE OUT ON TWITTER AND LAST HOUR -- HE

50:56 DOZEN SOUND TOO HAPPY. IT SEEMS THERE IS NO READINESS

51:02 EITHER TO INVITE UKRAINE TO NATO NOR TO MAKE IT A MEMBER OF

51:05 THE ALLIANCE. UNCERTAINTY IS WEAKNESS, HE

51:08 SAYS. TOM:

51:15 ITS COMPLEX AND THE KEY IS ALREADY GONE, THE SURPRISE OVER

51:17 THE LAST 48 HOURS. JONATHAN: THAT'S COMING UP IN THE NEXT

51:21 HOUR ON BLOOMBERG TV AND RADIO.

51:37 >> I JUMPED FEEL LIKE THE MARKET HAS BEEN CRAZY.

51:40 I SEE THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME UPSIDE.

51:43 >> THE MARKET IS BEING VERY RATIONAL.

51:46 >> INVESTORS HAVE BEEN INVESTING IN A NEW REGIME FOR

51:50 THE LAST 10 YEARS.

51:51 >> THE FED IS NOT FIGHTING AS BIG AN INFLATION PROBLEM IS WE

51:54 THOUGHT 90 DAYS AGO.

51:55 >> WE THINK THINGS START TO SLOW DOWN BY THE END OF THE

51:57 YEAR.

51:57 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE. JONATHAN:

52:03 WELCOME TO 2023 WHERE THE NARRATIVE CHANGES EVERY WEEK.

52:07 FROM NEW YORK CITY THIS MORNING, GOOD MORNING, GOOD

52:10 MORNING FOR OUR AUDIENCE WORLDWIDE, THIS IS BLOOMBERG

52:11 SURVEILLANCE ON TV AND RADIO. YOUR EQUITY MARKET THIS TUESDAY

52:18 MORNING IS SLIGHTLY POSITED BY ZERO .1% ON THE S&P 500.

52:21 A NATO SUMMIT IS UNDERWAY IN LITHUANIA. TOM:

52:28 WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE OK BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN, THIS IS A BIG

52:29 DEAL.

52:30 THERE ARE IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS AND WE HEARD FROM

52:36 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. ITS A STEW RIGHT NOW.

52:44 FROM TURKEY ALL THE WAY UP TO SWEDEN, THERE IS A LOT OF

52:47 MOVABLE ARTS IN THE NEXT 12 HOURS. JONATHAN:

52:53 AS WE ANTICIPATED THIS MEETING, SWEDEN'S PARTICIPATION BECOMING

52:55 A MEMBER OF NATO, GETTING THE SUPPORT OF TURKEY.

53:01 IS IT A SCRATCH MY BACK STORY AND THEN YOU HAVE A STORY OF

53:05 PROVISIONS THAT ARE CONTROVERSIAL.

53:10 ON TOP OF THAT, THE PATHWAY FOR UKRAINE TO BECOME A MEMBER OF

53:11 NATO. THAT IS HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL.

53:15 LISA: IT HIGHLIGHTS HOW THE CONVERSATION HAS EVOLVED 18

53:20 MONTHS AFTER THE INCEPTION OF THIS WAR AS IT DRAGS ON.

53:24 THERE IS A QUESTION OF HOW UNITED NATO MEMBERS ARE AND

53:26 WHAT THE EXIDE IN HIS RISK ARJUN CROSSING A POTENTIAL

53:39 REDLINE WE DONE UNDERSTAND -- TOM:

53:42 IF UKRAINE JOINS NATO, FROM MY AMATEUR READ, THAT WAS THE

53:46 TIPPING POINT FOR MR. PUTIN. WHAT IS HE THINKING HERE WITH

53:51 FENLON, -- WITH FINLAND, SWEDEN, PUTIN HAS TO BE

53:55 BORDERLINE HYSTERICAL. JONATHAN: WE TALKED ABOUT THIS IN THE

53:58 LAST HOUR. A PATHWAY TO PEACE?

54:05 NO DISCUSSION WHATSOEVER IN THE WARS GOING ON FOR LONGER THAN

54:06 PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WOULD. LISA: IS THERE LESS PRESSURE ON

54:09 ENDING IT BECAUSE WE HAVE AND SEEN THE INFLATIONARY BOOST

54:11 PEOPLE EXPECTED? THERE HAS IN BEEN THE ECONOMIC

54:14 HIT. I WAS READING HAVE STOCKPILES

54:19 OF NATURAL GAS IN EUROPE OR AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS IN A LONG

54:23 TIME SO THIS SEEMS TO BE A PROBLEM.

54:25 DOES THE LACK OF ECONOMIC INCENTIVE REDUCE THE PRESSURE

54:30 TO DRAW AN END TO THIS IN A WAY THAT SEEMS VERY MURKY AT A TIME

54:32 SO MUCH COMPLEXITY? TOM: WHEN MY EYES GLAZE OVER, WHAT

54:40 CAPTURES MY ATTENTION IS WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT CRIMEA.

54:44 I WONDER HOW ZELINSKI WILL DEAL WITH CRIMEA.

54:49 PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT ALMOST A CYPRUS ANNEXATION, SPLITTING,

54:52 SEPARATION. I DOVE NO. -- I DOVE NO.

55:06 -- I DOVE NO - I DON'T KLNOW. JONATHAN:

55:10 YIELDS ARE TRACKING A LITTLE BIT LOWER OVER THE LAST COUPLE

55:13 OF SESSIONS. MORE RECENTLY IN THE BOND

55:18 MARKET ON THE TWO-YEAR, YIELDS ARE LOWER OVER THE LAST THREE

55:19 SESSIONS.

55:25 WITH THAT, SOME DOLLAR WEAKNESS WITH THE EURO RECLAIMING .10.

55:33 LISA: WE ARE SEEING DISINFLATION IN

55:34 CAR PRICES AND SOME OF THE SMALLER BUSINESSES.

55:39 IS THAT A HEAD FAKE? THE NATO SUMMIT IS IN FOCUS

55:43 TODAY AS PRESIDENT BIDEN MEETS WITH ERDOGAN OF TURKEY.

55:48 THAT'S AT 11:00 A.M. AND WE GET A SENSE OF THE

55:53 TIT-FOR-TAT FOR F-16S AND SIGNS WERE WHAT UNITY THERE IS AROUND

55:54 YOU RAIN.

56:00 GOING THROUGH THE WEEK, WE HAVE THE FUTURE OF NEW MEDIA AND ALL

56:01 THINGS STREAMING.

56:08 LAST YEAR WE TALKED ABOUT TWITTER AND ELON MUSK AND ELON

56:11 MUSK WILL NOT BE THERE THIS YEAR AT A TIME WHEN EVERYONE IS

56:15 FOCUSED ON THREADS WHICH SEEMS TO BE GAINING TRACTION. TOM:

56:19 I'M GOING TO DELETE ITS. TO ME, ITS A NUISANCE. JONATHAN:

56:22 YOU ARE DONE WITH THREADS? TOM: THE LINKAGE TO INSTAGRAM, IDENT

56:28 WANT TO SEE PEOPLE GETTING DRUNK ON THE WEEKEND AND THAT'S

56:30 BASICALLY WHAT I'M WATCHING ON INSTAGRAM. LISA:

56:32 I THOUGHT YOU LIKED BAR CHAT. TOM: I LIKED BAR CHAT.

56:39 BAR CHAT GIVES ME BAR CHARTS.

56:45 WITH ALL THIS UPROAR, WHY DO I NEED THIS? LISA:

56:49 YOU MIGHT BE IN THE MINORITY IF YOU LOOK AT THE SIGN-UPS.

56:56 WE ARE LOOKING AT AMAZON PRIME DATE WHICH STARTS TODAY AND

56:57 TOMORROW.

57:04 ITS INTERESTING BUT THEY HAVE THE IDEA THAT THEY ARE GETTING

57:05 LESS TRACTION IN THESE PRIME DAYS.

57:10 THERE INCREASING THEIR SALES LESS YEAR-OVER-YEAR WITH EVERY

57:13 CONSECUTIVE YEAR SINCE THE 30% INCREASE IN 2020. TOM:

57:16 DO YOU SAVE MONEY? JONATHAN: NO, BUT ITS HIGHLY CONVENIENT.

57:23 SATURDAY NIGHT I RE-WATCHED GLADIATOR, ONE OF MY FAVORITE

57:30 MOVIES OF ALL TIME.

57:32 I THOUGHT I WANT TO GET MEDITATIONS WHICH IS THE

57:34 MARKETS ARE REALLY HIS BOOK SO I ORDERED IT SATURDAY NIGHT AND

57:35 I ORDERED IT SUNDAY MORNING. WHO ELSE PROVIDES THAT KIND OF

57:39 SERVICE? LISA:

57:45 I ORDERED A STANDALONE TENT OF MESH FOR MY YOUNGER SUN AND IT

57:47 CAME OVERNIGHT. IT WAS FANTASTIC. JONATHAN:

57:54 IT WAS ALL ABOUT PRICE BEFORE BUT NOW ITS ABOUT CONVENIENCE.

57:57 TOM: I USE IT CONSTANTLY. WE USE IT FOR ONE OR TWO ITEMS

58:03 AND THE TRUCKS ARE OUT ON 3RD AVENUE PILING UP IN THREE LANES.

58:07 JONATHAN: FIVE SEEN THAT. TOM: THE LAST MILE IS A BIG DEAL.

58:13 JONATHAN: PHIL CAMPELLI IS WITH US AND

58:18 DOZENS WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

58:22 >> I LOVE GLADIATOR AS WELL. LISA: WE ARE RE-CREATING IT.

58:26 JONATHAN: ON FRIDAY, WE GET EARNINGS.

58:30 WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT YOUR BANK SPECIFICALLY THE WHAT DO YOU

58:33 EXPECT THIS EARNINGS SEASON FROM THE BANKS AND BIG TECH AND

58:35 CAN THE RALLY BROUGHT OUT?

58:37 >> IS GOING TO LOOK BETTER THAN IT DID IN MARCH.

58:42 I THINK THERE WERE SO MANY HEAD FAKES AND NOISE AT THE END OF

58:43 THE FIRST QUARTER THAT EVEN THE FED GOT FAKED OUT.

58:46 THEY EXPECTED US TO BE IN RECESSION BY NOW.

58:52 MANY PEOPLE WERE SAYING THAT BY JULY AND SEPTEMBER, THE FED

58:53 COULD BE EASING. THIS IS A YEAR WHERE THE

58:58 NARRATIVE CHANGES EVERY SINGLE WEEK.

59:03 WE HAVE DROPPED OUR RECESSION PROBABILITY FROM 40% IN MARCH

59:06 TWO 25% NOW. WE ARE PRETTY HIGHLY CONVICTED

59:10 THAT WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A SOFT LANDING.

59:12 WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE?

59:16 >> DEMEANS THE ECONOMY CAN CONTINUE TO GROW AND AVOID

59:19 RECESSION THAT'S WHY WE DROP THEIR PROBABILITY AND

59:21 EMPLOYMENT SAY STRONG AND THAT'S BEEN THE SIGNAL ALL

59:27 ALONG.

59:28 PEOPLE SAY WE ARE GOING INTO A RECESSION AND THE LABOR MARKET

59:29 HAS BEEN VERY RESILIENT. THE THIRD POINT IS THE EASY HAS

59:33 TO GET PUSHED OUT. I THINK THAT WAS ONE OF THE

59:39 BIGGEST MRS. THIS YEAR WAS THAT THERE WAS SO MUCH EASING PRICED

59:41 INTO THE BACK CAP OF THE YEAR THAT HAD TO GO ALONG WITH

59:44 PRICES -- YOU HAD TO BELONG ON A CRISIS IF YOU BELIEVE IN

59:47 EASING IN THE BACK HALF OF THIS YEAR. THE INFLATION TRAJECTORY

59:51 FLATTENS OUT.

59:57 YOU HEARD TWO MORE HIKES AND THEY WILL PROBABLY DO ONE MORE

59:59 THAN THEY'RE COMFORTABLE WITH BECAUSE WE ARE NOT NEAR OUR

01:00:01 TARGET OF 2% INFLATION. ITS AN AWESOME TIME TO BE A

01:00:06 MULTI-ACID INVESTOR WE ARE UP 10% THIS YEAR.

01:00:10 EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT NVIDIA BUT A BALANCE FUND UP

01:00:15 10% IS EXCITING AS WELL AND CERTAINLY MORE THAN THE

01:00:16 THREE-MONTH PEOPLE AT 5%.

01:00:22 TOM: I LOVE YOUR RESEARCH WHERE YOU

01:00:24 SAY TO DO THIS BUT THE IDEA HERE IS YOU HAVE TO BE IN THE

01:00:28 MARKET.

01:00:28 >> YES. TOM:

01:00:34 TALK TO PEOPLE WHO ARE SCARED STIFF.

01:00:39 >> WE'VE HEARD IT ALL YEAR, WE'VE HEARD DEBT CEILING AND

01:00:40 REGIONAL BANK CRISIS. IT WAS A FOREGONE CONCLUSION

01:00:44 THERE WERE BE RECESSION THIS YEAR.

01:00:47 I'M NOT SAYING GET OUT OF CASH AND GO INTO EQUITIES.

01:00:51 WHEN YOU ARE MAKING A BET ON A BALANCE DIVERSE PORTFOLIO WHICH

01:00:54 HAS WORKED OVER SO MANY YEARS, YOU ARE NOT MAKING A BET ON

01:00:56 STOCKS OR BONDS. YOU'RE MAKING A BET ON THE

01:00:59 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THOSE TWO AS IT PASSES WHICH WAS

01:01:03 ABSOLUTELY INVERTED LAST YEAR. LAST YEAR WAS THE FIRST YEARS

01:01:09 AND'S 1974 THAT STOCKS AND BONDS WERE DOWN IN THE SAME

01:01:10 YEAR. WHEN I CAME ON THE SHOW AND

01:01:14 TOLD YOU WE HAVE THE BEST FORECASTED RETURN FOR 60/40 HAD

01:01:20 SINCE 2010 AND COMING INTO THIS YEAR, THOSE ARE THE FOLKS I AM

01:01:21 AFTER. THEY ARE SITTING IN THE THREE-MONTH PEOPLE AND ITS A

01:01:27 HEDGE FUND OUT THERE AT FIVE PLUS PERCENT AND THEY ARE

01:01:29 SAYING I'M SAFE HERE. THE BALANCE FUND IS UP 10% IN

01:01:34 THEIR OPPORTUNITIES JUST WENT UP. LISA:

01:01:38 YOU TALKED ABOUT THE SOFT LANDING POSSIBILITY WHICH

01:01:39 HINGES ON DISINFLATION. WE'VE SEEN DISINFLATION WITH

01:01:43 USED-CAR PRICES GOING DOWN. YOU'VE SEEN DISINFLATION SOME

01:01:46 OF THE RENTAL PRICES. WE'VE SEEN DISINFLATION EVEN IN

01:01:49 SMALL BUSINESS. IF YOU LOOK OUT, THAT STARTS TO

01:01:54 CHANGE LATER IN THE YEAR.

01:02:00 IS THE DISINFLATION WE SEE A HEAD FAKE OR COULD THAT BE A

01:02:01 POTENTIAL RISK?

01:02:05 >> THAT'S THE BIGGEST RISK TO THE FORECAST WHERE THE

01:02:07 INFLATION TRENDS HIGHER FOR THE END OF THE YEAR.

01:02:12 WHEN THE BASE EFFECT OF JUNE ROLLS OFF ONLY GET TOMORROW'S

01:02:19 CPI NUMBER, THE BASE CASE HAS TO BE FOR CENTRAL BANKERS TO

01:02:21 TALK EXTREMELY HAWKISH LEE. THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO LEND.

01:02:27 THAT CONTROLS THE HOUSING MARKET.

01:02:32 IF THE HOUSING MARKET SHOWS FIRMNESS TOWARD THE END OF THIS

01:02:35 YEAR, THAT'S A SCENARIO WHERE YOU COULD HAVE EQUITIES GOING

01:02:39 DOWN AND BONDS GOING DOWN BUT NOT TO THE SAME EXTENT AS LAST

01:02:40 YEAR. THAT'S PROBABLY OUR BUSINESS

01:02:46 DISH OUR BIGGEST RISK IS THAT A TRENDS HIGHER INSTEAD OF STICKY

01:02:49 INFLATION, ACCELERATING INFLATION HAPPENS AND THAT

01:02:51 WOULD BE THE BIGGEST RISK. WE ARE NOT INVESTING FOR THAT

01:02:56 BUT THAT'S PROBABLY MORE RISK THAN THE U.S.

01:03:01 IN RECESSION BY THE END OF THE YEAR. JONATHAN:

01:03:04 WHAT ARE YOU INVESTING IN?

01:03:07 >> WEED ON HAVE ENOUGH OF A GROWTH DETERIORATION STORY THAT

01:03:13 WOULD SPEED UP A DISINFLATIONARY BACK IT TO

01:03:14 PERCENT BEFORE THE END OF NEXT YEAR. THAT DOES IT MEAN YOU CANT

01:03:17 INVEST IN THE MARKET. IF ITS FLAT, ITS OK AND MAYBE

01:03:23 YOU GO -- DRUNK AT THE RETURN IN BONDS THAT MAYBE YOU GET

01:03:28 THAT BREADTH STORY IN THE S&P 490 WHICH IS EVERYONE ELSE TO

01:03:31 KEEP THE MARKET GOING. TOM: ITS LIKE THE DOW 27.

01:03:39 THE HEADLINE INFLATION, 4% PRIOR, PLUNGING TO 3.1%.

01:03:45 I DO THINK ENOUGH HAS BEEN MADE ABOUT TOMORROW.

01:03:48 YOU GET A HEADLINE INFLATION NUMBER AND WHAT IF IT COMES IN

01:03:50 AT 2.9%? JONATHAN: THAT WOULD MAKE SET UP.

01:03:57 >> THEY KNOW THAT LAST JUNE'S NUMBER WAS 1.2% AND THAT'S

01:03:58 ROLLING OFF.

01:03:59 IF YOU GET A HIGH .1 OR .2, THAT'S NOT WAVING A VICTORY

01:04:06 FLAG. JONATHAN: I'M TRYING TO MAKE THIS

01:04:10 EXCITING GOING INTO TOMORROW MORNING. LISA:

01:04:17 YOU CAN TELL HE'S AN ASSET MANAGER, EXCITED FOR RETURNS OF

01:04:22 A BALANCED FUND WHEN NVIDIA HAS DELIVERED 188%.

01:04:26 WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM, EQUITY FUTURES ARE POSITIVE BY ZERO

01:04:27 POINT 15%.

01:04:29 COMING UP AT 7:30 A.M., FS INVESTMENTS ON THE INFLATION

01:04:37 DATA. LISA: IT WAS INTERESTING HOW HE SAID

01:04:42 THE BIGGEST POTENTIAL RISK IS NOT THE U.S.

01:04:43 FULL LENGTH RECESSION BUT IT NEEDS CHUGGING ALONG.

01:04:46 WHAT HAPPENS OF THE DISINFLATION WE ARE SEEING IN

01:04:53 CERTAIN AREAS REVERTS AND RESTORES AN INFLATIONARY PUSH

01:04:54 THAT FORCE THE FEDS AND? THAT MAYBE SEEMS INCREASINGLY

01:04:57 LIKELY. JONATHAN:

01:05:04 TK IS OFF THREAD'S AND ELON MUSK NEEDS TO GET ON IT.

01:05:10 BRAMO HAS A FAKE ACCOUNT AND ITS BEEN VERIFIED AND HAS A

01:05:13 THOUSAND FOLLOWERS. LISA:

01:05:19 MY GOODNESS, SERIOUSLY? I CANT SEE ANY OF THAT.

01:05:26 THIS IS THE REASON WHY TWITTER IS LOSING A LOT OF TRACTION.

01:05:29 I HAVE TONS AND TONS OF IMPERSONATORS.

01:05:36 JONATHAN: THEY USED VERIFICATION BUT ITS

01:05:37 NOT VERIFICATION. LISA: SOMEONE ASKED ME TO WINK TWICE

01:05:44 IF I WAS THE REAL ME AND I AM WINKING SO THANK YOU. TOM:

01:06:05 >> WE ARE JUST WE KNOW THAT ADDING FINLAND AND SWEDEN TO

01:06:06 NATO IS CONTROVERSIAL.

01:06:13 WE AGREE ON THE LANGUAGE THAT WE PROPOSED IN YOU PROPOSED

01:06:18 RELATIVE TO THE FUTURE OF UKRAINE BEING ABLE TO JOIN NATO.

01:06:27 WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO IT CONTINUED UNITED NATO. JONATHAN:

01:06:31 THE PRESENT OF THE UNITED STATES SPEAKING AT THE NATO

01:06:34 CONFERENCE IN THE LAST HOUR. HE'S VERY PROUD OF HIMSELF.

01:06:42 YOU FIGURED OUT HOW TO DEACTIVATE THREADS.

01:06:47 YOU DID THAT WITHOUT DEACTIVATING INSTAGRAM? TOM:

01:06:49 I DO REALLY UNDERSTAND IT. LISA: I'M EXPERIMENTING WITH THREADS.

01:06:55 JONATHAN: YOU COULD BE THE BLOOMBERG

01:06:56 SURVEILLANCE ACCOUNT ON THREADS. TOM: I COULD GO BACK ON.

01:07:00 JONATHAN: I THINK I AM DONE. I DOES NEED ANOTHER APP.

01:07:06 TOM: ANNE-MARIE HORDERN IS UP TO 145,000 FOLLOWERS.

01:07:15 LET'S GET THROUGH THIS WITH FUTURES UP SIX.

01:07:18 WHAT ELSE DO YOU SEE ON THE DATA SCREEN? JONATHAN:

01:07:23 YIELDS ARE COMING IN AND THE DOLLAR IS UP. TOM:

01:07:28 THIS IS THE PROFESSIONAL BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE CHECK.

01:07:32 FORTUNATELY, WE HAVE A LOT TO TALK ABOUT OUR BLOOMBERG

01:07:34 WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT. WHAT'S BEEN THE BIGGEST

01:07:40 SURPRISE AS YOU LANDED IN LITHUANIA?

01:07:42 THAT'S THE SINGLE THING THAT STICKS OUT NOW? ANNMARIE:

01:07:49 WHAT STICKS OUT IS THE TENSION BETWEEN UKRAINE AND THE NATO

01:07:50 ALLIANCE. WHAT YOU HAVE IS JOE BIDEN

01:07:56 BEING WELCOMED BY STOLTENBERG TO THE MEETING IN LITHUANIA.

01:07:59 HE SAID WE AGREE WITH YOU AND THE WORDING YOU PUT FORWARD IN

01:08:04 TERMS OF AT SOME POINT HOW THEY COULD SEE UKRAINE BECOMING A

01:08:06 MEMBER OF NATO. THEN WHAT YOU SAW ON TWITTER

01:08:13 WAS A SCOLDING FROM PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY SAYING HE IS ON HIS

01:08:15 WAY TO THE NATO SUMMIT ANY CANNOT BELIEVE THEY ARE EVEN

01:08:18 DISCUSSING THE LANGUAGE REGARDING UKRAINE.

01:08:23 THEY SAY POTENTIALLY HOW THEY WILL BE HEDGED ABOUT BEING

01:08:27 ADMITTED POTENTIALLY AT SOME POINT.

01:08:31 IT LOOKS LIKE SO AND SKI WANTS MORE THAN THAT.

01:08:32 IT LOOKS LIKE HE WANTS SPECIFIC TIMELINES AND DATES AND I JUST

01:08:36 ON SEE THAT HAPPENING AT THIS SUMMIT IN PARTICULAR. JONATHAN:

01:08:39 HOW UNREALISTIC IS THAT?

01:08:46 ANNMARIE: THE PRESIDENT WAS ON CNN OVER

01:08:48 THE WEEKEND AND HE SAID IT UNANIMOUS.

01:08:53 HE SAID THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE THAT HAS TO BE DONE WITHIN

01:08:56 UKRAINE, NUTS IS THE FACT THAT THERE IS A WAR IN THE COUNTRY

01:09:00 BUT ALSO THE FACT WHEN IT COMES TO DEMOCRATIZATION.

01:09:05 HE SAYS THERE NEEDS TO BE DONE IN UKRAINE BEFORE THEY COULD

01:09:07 SEE THIS ASCENSION INTO THE NATO ALLIANCE.

01:09:09 THERE IS A LOT OF COUNTRIES THAT HAVE MIXED FEELINGS AND

01:09:14 THERE IS AN OPEN LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT FROM A NUMBER OF

01:09:15 FOREIGN POLICY EXPERTS AND FORMER U.S.

01:09:19 OFFICIALS WHO WANT TO SEE A QUICK PATH OF UKRAINE TO JOIN

01:09:20 NATO. SOME OF THEM SAY WHEN IT COMES

01:09:24 TO ARTICLE 5, 1 WAY THEY COULD POTENTIALLY AROUND THAT IS THAT

01:09:29 THEY WOULD CLAIM THE TERRITORY THAT UKRAINE HAS RIGHT NOW

01:09:33 WOULD BE THE ONLY TERRITORY THAT ARTICLE FIVE WOULD HAVE TO

01:09:36 RESPECT AND GO DEFEND. IT WOULD BASICALLY TAKE AWAY

01:09:42 THE LIKES OF CRIMEA AND OTHER AREAS AND TERRITORIES OF

01:09:45 UKRAINE THAT RUSSIA HAS ILLEGALLY ANNEXED. JONATHAN:

01:09:50 THERE WAS A SERIES OF COMPLAINTS AND A LOT OF THEM

01:09:53 RESONATED WITH MANY PEOPLE AND MANY YEARS LATER, ITS SPOT ON.

01:09:59 THE CONTRIBUTION TO MILITARY SPENDING AND SOME OF THESE

01:10:01 COUNTRIES AND SOME MEMBERS OF NATO HAS AN IMPROVED.

01:10:05 AS YOU LOOK AROUND THE ROOM NOW, IS IT STILL JUST THE

01:10:07 UNITED STATES DOING THE HEAVY LIFTING? ANNMARIE:

01:10:12 I REMEMBER THAT NATO MEETING WELL BECAUSE I WAS THERE.

01:10:16 FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP CAUSED QUITE A FLUSTER WHEN HE WAS

01:10:20 DEMANDING AND WANTED TO BREAK UP THE MEETING UNTIL HE GOT

01:10:21 SOME SERIOUS COMMITMENTS. BY AND LARGE, IT STILL REMAINS

01:10:25 THAT THE U.S. IS DOING THE BULK LOAD WHEN IT

01:10:30 COMES TO THE MILITARY SPENDING OF THIS ALLIANCE.

01:10:34 IT IS FAIR TO SAY LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS THAT YOU HAVE SEEN

01:10:36 AN UPTICK OF SOME OF THESE COUNTRIES IN TERMS OF THEIR

01:10:38 MILITARY SPENDING. THE TWO KEY THINGS YOU WANT TO

01:10:42 TAKE AWAY HIS THEY WANT TO PERCENT TO BE THE FLOOR.

01:10:47 THAT NEEDS TO BE THE MINIMUM THESE COUNTRIES NEED TO BE

01:10:48 SPENDING AND THEY WILL EMPHASIZE THIS AT THE MEETING

01:10:52 BUT A LOT OF THESE COUNTRIES AT THIS NATO SUMMIT WILL COME OUT

01:10:57 EITHER COLLECTIVELY OR SINGLE-HANDEDLY AND TALK ABOUT

01:11:01 WHAT THEY WANT TO PROVIDE IN TERMS OF MILITARY AMMUNITION

01:11:04 AND SUPPORT TO UKRAINE. THERE IS THE DEFENSE SPENDING

01:11:11 BUT THERE IS ALSO WHAT MILITARY MEANT THEY HAVE NOW THAT THEY

01:11:16 WILL EARMARK AND SAY THIS WILL GO TO OUR SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE.

01:11:21 LISA: MANY EXPECTED VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY TO BE THE CENTER OF

01:11:24 DISCUSSIONS AT THE NATO SUMMIT THIS YEAR.

01:11:28 TURKEYS ERGODAN HAS SUCKED THE OXYGEN OUT OF THE ROOM NOT

01:11:34 ONLY WITH -- TURKEYS ERDOGAN HAS SUCKED THE OXYGEN OUT OF

01:11:35 THE ROOM. THEY DESIRED TO BE PART OF THE

01:11:39 EUROPEAN UNION. WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR TODAY?

01:11:46 ANNMARIE: WHAT YOU WILL HEAR IS BIDEN OR

01:11:51 ERDOGAN COME OUT AND SADIE F-16 SAGA THAT'S BEEN GOING ON IS

01:11:57 OVER AND THEY WILL LIKELY GET THAT DELIVERY AND SHIPMENT.

01:12:05 EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THIS HAS BEEN THE DISCUSSIONS BEHIND THE

01:12:07 SCENES AND THERE'S BEEN PRESSURE FROM KEY SENATORS LIKE

01:12:11 BOB MENENDEZ, THE CHAIR OF THE SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS

01:12:12 COMMITTEE, TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN RELY -- GREENLIGHT THE

01:12:19 F-16S AND ERDOGAN LAST NIGHT GREENLIGHTED SWEDEN'S PATH.

01:12:24 WHAT YOU SAW WHEN HE WAS TRYING TO BLAME THE EUROPEAN ASCENSION

01:12:29 OF TURKEY WAS HIS WAY OF TRYING TO EXTRACT ANY SORT OF

01:12:31 CONCESSION HE COULD GET AS HE HAS THIS POWER.

01:12:35 HE KNEW EVERYONE AROUND HIM REALLY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THEY

01:12:38 COULD CLAIM VICTORY AT NATO AND IT WASN'T JUST FINLAND THAT'S

01:12:44 NOW IN THE GROUP AND THEY ARE CELEBRATING THAT BUT THAT THEY

01:12:50 FINALLY WERE ABLE TO GET SWEDEN AND THEY HAVE AN ABSOLUTE HOLD

01:12:52 ON THE BALTIC SEA. THIS WAS IMPORTANT FOR THE NATO

01:12:55 ALLIANCE AND THE PRESIDENT. YOU SAW EARLY GUN COMING OFF AN

01:13:00 ELECTION AND HE WAS USING THIS OF WHAT HE HAS AT HOME AND

01:13:04 TRYING TO EXTRACT AS MANY CONCESSIONS AS HE COULD.

01:13:06 JONATHAN: LOOKING FORWARD TO TOUCHING

01:13:07 BASE WITH YOU IN ABOUT AN HOUR AREA SOME FANTASTIC NOTES ON

01:13:12 WALL STREET IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS SO THANK YOU IF YOU ARE

01:13:15 LISTENING.

01:13:24 WE TALK ABOUT THIS RESEARCH -- THE FLAWED LOGIC IN THE CURRENT

01:13:28 MARKET NARRATIVE -- THE MARKET SEEMS TO THINK THE FED RETURNS

01:13:32 TO THE 2% TARGET AND EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE.

01:13:34 THERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS WITH THIS LOGIC.

01:13:39 THE ONE PROBLEM HE IDENTIFIES AS IF INFLATION COMES DOWN

01:13:42 FASTER THAN THE FED EXPECTS COME IS BECAUSE THE ECONOMY IS

01:13:43 SLOWING FASTER THAN THE FED EXPECT.

01:13:47 FOR EXAMPLE, WHOLESALE CAR PRICES DECLINE MORE QUICKLY

01:13:51 THAN EXPECTED, IS DRIVEN BY SHARPER THAN EXPECTED DROP OFF

01:13:52 IN DEMAND FOR CARS. TOM: I TOTALLY AGREE AND I WOULD

01:13:57 OVERLAY IT ACROSS NOMINAL GDP. IF YOU GET INFLATION TO COME

01:14:03 DOWN WITH SOME KIND OF REAL GDP TEPIDNESS, YOU GET A NOMINAL

01:14:06 GDP AT 4%?

01:14:12 MAYBE UNDER AND THAT AFFECTS THE LINE TO CORPORATIONS AND

01:14:13 THAT'S WHERE YOU GET INTO THE EARNINGS DEBATES. JONATHAN:

01:14:18 HE GOES ON TO SAY THE FED AND ACADEMICS A TAKES 18 MONTHS

01:14:22 BEFORE ECONOMIC POLICY AFFECTS THE ECONOMY IS TRUE WHEN THE

01:14:26 FED RAISES RATES AND WHERE THE RATES -- AND WHEN THEY CUT

01:14:31 RATES.

01:14:32 THIS IS A PRETTY BEARISH VIEW ON THE WAY THE MARKET POSITION

01:14:35 IS GOING INTO THE ECONOMIC DATA. LISA:

01:14:40 IF THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS FAR AS

01:14:41 TALKING ABOUT A SOFT LANDING.

01:14:47 WE ARE STILL IN PANDEMIC ECONOMICS ACCORDING TO TOM

01:14:50 KEENE , THE GREAT ECONOMIST, AND WE HAVE A LOT OF

01:14:52 DISTORTIONS NOT WORKING THE WAY WE OTHERWISE THOUGHT LIKE THE

01:14:55 HOUSING MARKET.

01:14:57 JONATHAN: YOU HAVE NEVER ACKNOWLEDGED

01:15:02 EACH OTHER. LISA: THAT WAS ONE WAY. JONATHAN:

01:15:10 ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE BRAMO A COMPLEMENT NOW? TOM:

01:15:12 ITS A TOXIC BREW. JONATHAN: HE TRIED.

01:15:32 JONATHAN: STOCKS PICKING UP ON THE S&P

01:15:33 500. THE NASDAQ AS WELL.

01:15:40 THE S&P POSITIVE, 0.2%. BY .25% ON THE NASDAQ.

01:15:47 GAINS ON THE S&P 500, CONTINUING TO READ THIS FROM

01:15:48 APOLLO. THE FED HIGHS WILL DRAG THE

01:15:55 ECONOMY DOWN, THAT IS WHY RECESSION IS MORE LIKELY THAN

01:15:57 SOFT LANDING. I'M NOT SAYING HE HAS DONE THIS

01:15:59 TO COUNTER THE NEW YORK FED PRESIDENT. DOES COUNTER HIM.

01:16:05 HE SAID TO THE FT, I DON'T HAVE A RECESSION IN MY FORECAST, I

01:16:08 HAVE SLOW GROWTH. THIS GOING INTO THE FEDERAL

01:16:15 RESERVE MEETING LATER THIS MONTH WITH A TWO YEAR YIELD

01:16:16 WEEKLY. WE ARE BACK DOWN TO 484 THIS

01:16:21 MORNING.

01:16:27 TOM: LET'S PAUSE AND SAY WHY JOHN

01:16:28 WILLIAMS MATTERS. HE HAS THE SAN FRANCISCO TOUR

01:16:34 OF DUTY AND IS AT THE NEW YORK FED, WHICH IS A DIFFERENT FED.

01:16:43 WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS THIS ODD PHRASE, A GUESS OF NORMAL, WILL

01:16:46 IT BE THE NEW NORMAL? HE SAYS WE ARE GOING TO GET

01:16:51 BACK TO PRE-COVID NORMAL OR ARE WE GOING TO SET WITH A HIGHER

01:16:56 INFLATION AND INTEREST RATE ZERO -- REGIME?

01:17:02 JONATHAN: SOME SLOWING IN JOBS, OVERALL

01:17:12 WORK THE NUMBER OF HOURS IN THE U.S., -- LISA, THAT IS NOT SOME

01:17:14 THING WE SEE CURRENTLY IN THIS LABOR MARKET. LISA:

01:17:17 HE TALKS ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE AUTUMN LIMIT RATE GOING

01:17:20 TO 4.5% BY THE NEXT YEAR. WE ARE NOT SEEING THAT.

01:17:27 WHAT MORE DO THEY HAVE TO DO TO OFFSET THAT?

01:17:31 I WILL GIVE YOU A SENSE OF WHAT THE COUNTERPOINT TO THE

01:17:35 ARGUMENT IS FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE BASED ON INDIVIDUAL

01:17:36 COMPANIES. ZILLOW, ONLINE HOME SHOPPING,

01:17:41 SHARES UP MORE THAN 4%. THEY WERE RAISED FROM

01:17:45 OVERWEIGHT TO NEUTRAL BY PiPER SANDLER. SHARES UP ALMOST 50%.

01:17:52 THE HOUSING MARKET IS SUPPOSED TO BE FALLING OUT OF BED

01:17:54 BECAUSE OF MORTGAGE RATES AT 7%. THIS IS THE CONUNDRUM FOR THE

01:17:59 FEDERAL RESERVE, LOOKING AT A MARKET THAT HAS LOOKED BEYOND

01:18:00 RATE HIKES. I KEEP WATCHING THE HOMEBUILDERS.

01:18:07 JONATHAN: TERRIBLE WEBSITE. TOM: IT IS HARD TO USE BUT I AM

01:18:12 ADDICTED. IT IS LIKE VOYEURISM. LISA: ME TOO.

01:18:18 JONATHAN: RIGHT MOVE IN THE U.K.,

01:18:21 SUPERIOR WEBSITE. IF YOU CAN WORK IT OUT. TOM:

01:18:28 YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A PILE OF BRICKS IN THE MIDDLE OF

01:18:29 NOWHERE, THE COTSWOLDS OR WHATEVER. JONATHAN:

01:18:34 YOU ARE THINKING HIGH-END PROPERTY.

01:18:38 RIGHT MOVE PUTS ALL THE PROPERTIES IN THE SAME PLACE.

01:18:41 YOUR KIND AND THEN PROPERTIES YOU CAN ACTUALLY AFFORD. TOM:

01:18:46 THE COTSWOLDS ARE LOVELY. THE SHEEP IN THE ROAD.

01:18:53 LISA: I CAN SEE YOU TAKING CARE OF

01:18:54 SHEEP. JONATHAN:

01:19:00 -- IN THE STUDIO. LISA: YOU COULD STICK A COUPLE OF

01:19:04 STEAKS ON THAT. JPMORGAN CHASE, SHARES OF 1.3%

01:19:11 AS THEY ARE RAISED FROM A HOLD TO A BUY.

01:19:15 THEY REPORT EARNINGS FRIDAY, EVERYONE IS EXPECTING

01:19:18 ARMAGEDDON -- OR SOME NEGATIVE EARNINGS RESULTS BECAUSE OF THE

01:19:23 INVERTED YIELD CURVE. THE BIGGEST ARE THE TAKE ALLS.

01:19:29 JP MORGAN. NE-YO, THE CHINESE BASED

01:19:39 ELECTRIC VEHICLE MAKER, THOSE SHARES UP 2.4 PERCENT AS MORGAN

01:19:42 STANLEY SAYS THE SHOWED BIG IMPROVEMENT NEXT MONTH.

01:19:47 WE HAVE SEEN THIS FROM RIVIAN AND TESLA, IT IS BUILDING, EVEN

01:19:50 AT A TIME WHEN WE ARE SEEING SIGNS OF A BUILDUP OF ELECTRIC

01:19:51 VEHICLES.

01:20:01 WE ARE SEEING A LACK OF DEMAND FOR PRODUCTION.

01:20:02 THE BIFURCATION IS INTERESTING. JONATHAN:

01:20:07 IS THAT JONAS AT MORGAN STANLEY? LISA: I BELIEVE SO.

01:20:11 NO, IT IS TIM. JONATHAN: WELL THE WHOLE STREAM ON THE

01:20:16 AUTO INDUSTRY IS FANTASTIC. WHEN YOU GO THROUGH THE WHOLE

01:20:22 SUPPLY CHAIN START TO FINISH, HOW GREEN ARE THE?

01:20:24 WHEN DO YOU START TO BREAK EVEN? LISA:

01:20:29 HOW MUCH IS IT PREDICATED ON THE IDEA OF THE PARTS WILL BE

01:20:32 RECYCLED INTO FUTURE ITERATIONS WHEN THE TECHNOLOGY IS SHIFTING?

01:20:40 THIS IS OFFERED AT A TIME WHEN THE GOVERNMENTS ARE TRYING TO

01:20:41 PUSH THE VEHICLES. JONATHAN:

01:20:44 THAT WOULD BE MY -- CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW MUCH THEY WILL COST

01:20:52 TO FIX? OF GOT NO IDEA HOW RELIABLE

01:20:58 THESE ARE. TOM:

01:21:04 I WONDER IF IT IS LIKE RAILROADS IN AMERICA.

01:21:13 JONATHAN: THEY WILL SHOVE ALL THIS MONEY

01:21:14 INTO THIS EFFORT.

01:21:24 TOM: SHE WAS SHAKEN. LARA RHAME. JONATHAN:

01:21:29 LET'S GET TO THE RESEARCH. FOR PERCENT SAYING THIS.

01:21:43 -- 4% SAYING THIS. TOM: A BRILLIANT NOTE, SHE COMES

01:21:50 FROM A FOREIGN EXCHANGE BACKGROUND, CHIEF U.S.

01:21:53 ECONOMIST AT FS INVESTMENTS. SHE FOLLOWS THE DATA LIKE AN

01:21:56 ANIMAL. I LOVE HOW YOU ARE LOOKING AT

01:21:58 REAL YIELDS.

01:22:04 I LOOKED AT THE NOT THE 10 YEAR, THE VANILLA, BUT THE

01:22:05 INFLATION-ADJUSTED REAL YIELD. I'M THUNDERSTRUCK.

01:22:16 OUR RE--- ARE REAL YIELDS NOW WHERE THEY HAVE THE EFFECT ON

01:22:19 THE AMERICAN ECONOMY? LARA:

01:22:28 WE WERE TALKING ABOUT AUDIO, INTEREST RATES, THESE ARE THE

01:22:29 SECTORS THAT ARE AFFECTED. AS THE FED IS TRANSITIONED TO

01:22:35 THE END OF THAT, THE EDGING DOWN OF INFLATION HIGHS THIS

01:22:41 INSIDIOUS EFFECT VIA THE REAL RATES CHANNEL.

01:22:44 THAT IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO FEEL IN THE HOUSING

01:22:50 MARKET.

01:22:51 IT IS GOING TO BE A WEIGHT ON CONSUMERS.

01:22:54 IT IS NOT CATASTROPHIC BUT IT IS A LOT HIGHER.

01:22:57 HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS MATTER. TOM:

01:23:01 WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS WILL DO TO COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE?

01:23:04 AND IS NOT A BIG PART OF THE GDP PIE, BUT IT IS EMOTIONAL.

01:23:10 YOU ARE DOWN IN PHILADELPHIA, ROOTING FOR BRYCE AND THE REST.

01:23:13 YOU ARE IN PHILADELPHIA AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE MANHATTAN STARS

01:23:16 IN YOUR EYES. WHAT IS COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE

01:23:18 GOING TO DO IN PHILADELPHIA OR PHOENIX? LARA:

01:23:23 THOSE ARE DIFFERENT QUESTIONS. WE HAVE SEEN GEOGRAPHICALLY,

01:23:30 REGIONALLY A HUGE DISPERSION AMONGST PERFORMANCE.

01:23:34 WE ARE SO FOCUSED ON FINDING

01:23:40 THE OPPORTUNITY -- LIKE THE CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT.

01:23:45 WE ARE EXPERIENCING A LOWER RATE THAT SEEMS TO BE SETTLING

01:23:47 IN LOWER THAN PRE-COVID.

01:23:55 THERE ARE SO MANY SECTORS, MULTIFAMILY INDUSTRIAL, OR EVEN

01:23:58 SEEING HOSPITALITY DOING WELL SELECTIVELY.

01:24:03 IT IS AN AREA WHERE YOU CAN DIG IN AND FIND OPPORTUNITY.

01:24:07 IT WILL FIND NEW EQUILIBRIUM. WE ARE SEEING THAT IN HOUSING

01:24:11 AND COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE. YOU WANT TO BE THE BANK, LOOK

01:24:13 TOWARD INCOME. THERE ARE WAYS TO INVEST IN

01:24:18 COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE. IT WILL BE A AN IMPORTANT

01:24:23 SECTOR FOR ANY PORTFOLIO TO DIVERSIFY INTO. LISA:

01:24:28 THIS SPEAKS TO YOUR THEME THAT YOU DON'T THINK WE ARE GOING

01:24:31 BACK TO THE ERA OF LOW RATES AND LOW INFLATION OF

01:24:32 PRE-PANDEMIC.

01:24:38 HOW MUCH IS THIS IS THE -- THIS THE REAL ISSUE, THE

01:24:40 DISINFLATION IN AUTO, HOUSING, OTHER METRICS?

01:24:49 YEAR-OVER-YEAR, FOR SIX MONTHS, IT MAKES IT GO HIGHER.

01:24:58 LARA: HOUSING IS A PRIMARY EXAMPLE.

01:25:02 CYCLICAL HEADWINDS WITH INTEREST RATES, BUT STRUCTURAL

01:25:05 TAILWINDS GIVEN THE UNDER BUILDING AND UNDERINVESTMENT IN

01:25:06 THE SECTOR FOR YEARS.

01:25:13 THE FORECAST, A RECESSION IS IN MY FORECAST. IN THE BEGINNING

01:25:22 OF NEXT YEAR, IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE SEVERE.

01:25:24 THE FACT THAT INTEREST RATES

01:25:31 ARE NOW GOING TO OFFER

01:25:37 -- A TREND OF FALLING INTEREST RATES.

01:25:42 IT HAS CAUSED PEOPLE TO CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR OVER GENERATIONS.

01:25:45 I THINK WE ARE SEEING IT. LOOK AT THE BLOOMBERG BAG.

01:25:51 IT IS FLAT ON THE YEAR. YOU CANNOT LOCK IN A PRICE

01:25:57 AGAIN, YOU ARE LEFT RELYING ON INCOME THAT IS VERY LOW

01:26:00 RELATIVE TO WHERE INFLATION IS.

01:26:06 JONATHAN: ANOTHER PERSON TO CATCH UP WITH

01:26:12 SOON -- U.S. CONSUMERS HAVE SPENT AND ABOVE

01:26:16 TREND PACE OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS.

01:26:23 THE DYNAMIC IS FADING. EXCESS HOW -- HOUSEHOLD SAVINGS

01:26:30 LIKELY TO BE DEPLETED BY YEAR-END.

01:26:35 IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS, MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE

01:26:37 LOOKING FOR WIDER SPREADS, BASED ON WHERE THEY ARE.

01:26:42 THEY SAY OUR STUDY FOR BANKRUPTCY FINDINGS FOR SMALL

01:26:46 AND PRIVATE COMPANIES SHOWS A DEFAULT CYCLE IS UNDERWAY.

01:26:50 PUT THAT TOGETHER WITH PROJECTIONS ON WHAT PEOPLE LOOK

01:26:54 FOR AND I GUESS WE WILL SEE. LISA:

01:27:00 THE COUNTERPOINT IS THE SURVEY THIS MORNING THAT SHOWED SMALL

01:27:02 BUSINESS OPTIMISM EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS.

01:27:06 YES, THEY ARE RAISING PRICES AT THE LOWEST LEVEL SINCE 2021.

01:27:09 BUT THEY EXPECT TO RAISE PRICES AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE THE

01:27:13 MEMBER LATER THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR.

01:27:18 TO THAT POINT, OTHER PEOPLE ARE SAYING THE SAME THING.

01:27:21 CONSUMER SPENDING HAS TO FOLLOW OFF IF NOTHING ELSE BECAUSE OF

01:27:23 STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENTS AND EXTRA CASH. JONATHAN:

01:27:26 THAT IS IN THE FALL. TOM: IT IS EVIDENT IN THE TRAVEL

01:27:31 PLANS OF AMERICA. IS THERE ANYBODY NOT ON

01:27:35 AIRPLANES? I WOULD SUGGEST THAT REAL YIELD

01:27:39 IS A TANGIBLE ISSUE. I HAVE NO IDEA HOW THE

01:27:48 FIVE-YEAR REAL YIELD -- ABSOLUTE MOONSHOT. JONATHAN:

01:27:54 LISA IS DONE WITH FLYING. LISA: FOR ABOUT A WEEK. JONATHAN:

01:28:00 ARE YOU AWAY AGAIN? GREAT. ENJOY THE SUMMER.

01:28:07 FROM NEW YORK CITY THIS MORNING. WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM.

01:28:13 THE EQUITY MARKET IS POSITIVE, POSITIVE BY 0.41%.

01:28:21 COMING UP IN ABOUT 45 MINUTES

01:28:27 FROM NOW, FORMER FED ECONOMIST, THE LABOR MARKET DEVELOPING A

01:28:29 SUGGESTION ON WHAT THE FED SHOULD DO. TOM:

01:28:33 THE DAY IS LOOKING PRETTY GOOD. ABOUT TWO DAYS AGO SHE CAME OUT

01:28:40 WITH A STATEMENT LIKE WE HEARD FROM J.P.

01:28:43 MORGAN IN THE LAST HOUR. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS A SOFT

01:28:49 LANDING, THIS OR THAT, THE RECESSION GLOOM IS SLIPPING

01:28:54 AWAY. JONATHAN: AND HAS BEEN PUSHED OUT.

01:28:58 THAT IS THE BIG CHANGE, THE CREW, A THREE-MONTH ROLLING

01:29:01 FORECAST FOR A RECESSION. EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS YOU ARE

01:29:08 PUSHING OUT ANOTHER THREE MONTHS . LISA:

01:29:11 AT WHAT POINT DO PEOPLE CAPITULATE AND SAY THERE WON'T

01:29:14 BE A RECESSION? TOM: I'M GLAD YOU BRING IT UP.

01:29:22 OF ALL THE CALLS OF THE LAST 18 MONTHS, THE RECESSION CALL HAS

01:29:23 BEEN SILLY US TO. I GIVE DEUTSCHE BANK THE

01:29:27 GREATEST CREDIT. WE WILL HAVE A SLOWDOWN, BUT IT

01:29:31 IS WAY OUT. THAT IS WHAT HE SAID A YEAR AGO.

01:29:34 JONATHAN: JONATHAN: CALLING THE FORECAST SILLY?

01:29:40 TOM: I THINK THE GLOOM OF THE RECESSION, IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT

01:29:44 JAMES DOES, IT IS HARD TO CALL A RECESSION.

01:30:04 JONATHAN: ACTUAL CONVERSATION. I'M HAPPY FOR YOU.

01:30:10 WHAT SPORT DO YOU WANT TO DO? TOM: WE SHOULD DO SPORTS WITH A

01:30:14 LITTLE BREAK. LISA: THE SPORT IS GLADIATOR THAT WE

01:30:18 ARE DOING NOW. TOM: I HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE.

01:30:23 JONATHAN: WHAT? LISA: WE SHOULD HAVE A SURVEILLANCE

01:30:26 VIEWING. JONATHAN: HOW HAVE YOU AVOIDED THAT? TOM:

01:30:31 I DON'T HAVE THE TIME. JONATHAN: I'M SORRY -- I KNOW THE STUFF

01:30:38 YOU GET UP TO ON A WEEKEND. TOM: DO I WATCH ALREADY OR GLADIATOR

01:30:45 -- BARBIE OR GLADIATOR? JONATHAN:

01:30:51 ARE YOU ACTUALLY GOING TO WATCH BARBIE? TOM: NO. JONATHAN:

01:30:55 MISSION IMPOSSIBLE COMES OUT. TOM:

01:31:00 THE TRAILER HAD SOME REASON TO IT. JONATHAN: COME WITH ME.

01:31:05 IT WILL BE GREAT.

01:31:11 FUTURES ON THE S&P -- I JUST NOTICED A DECLINED? LISA:

01:31:14 NO, IT WOULD BE FUN. JONATHAN: THREE BASIS POINTS LOW ON THE

01:31:18 10 YEAR. YIELDS HAVE COME IN ON THE

01:31:23 FRONT END FOR A THIRD STRAIGHT SESSION.

01:31:28 A COUPLE OF BASIS POINTS THE TWO-YEAR, A BIT OF DOLLAR

01:31:35 WEAKNESS. WE HAVE SEEN THE EURO-DOLLAR

01:31:39 RECLAIM 1.1, STILL CLOSE TO 1.30, PUNCHY WAGE GROWTH DATA

01:31:40 OUT OF THE U.K.. TOM: THE 7% NUMBER IS A BIG NUMBER.

01:31:45 I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THAT HAPPENS. BUT THERE IT IS.

01:31:51 IT SPEAKS TO THE OPTIMISTS VIEW. WE'VE HEARD THIS FROM

01:31:58 OPPENHEIMER, REAFFIRMING A CONSTRUCTIVE SUMMER.

01:32:01 NEIL DUTTA SAYING THIS IS THE HEART OF THE MATTER, INFLATION

01:32:07 EBBING, FLAT WAGE GAINS TO POSITIVE REAL WAGE GAINS.

01:32:09 I USUALLY GET HATE MAIL. THANK YOU, STEPHEN FOR WRITING

01:32:12 IN. HE SAYS SURVEILLANCE IS TIMELY.

01:32:42 ONE OF THE REASON WE ARE TIMELY AND BALANCED AS WE TALKED TO

01:32:46 EXPERTS ON THEIR HERITAGE. WIN THIN WITH HIS UNIQUE VIEW

01:32:49 OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC, LEVELHEADED CURRENCY STRATEGY

01:32:52 AT BROWN BROTHERS HARRIMAN. I WAS GETTING A RATIONALIZATION

01:32:54 THE OTHER DAY.

01:33:00 DID THE CHINESE YUAN NOT DEPRECIATE OR DEVALUE -- I SAY

01:33:01 BALONEY. I LOOKED ON THE SCREEN AND SEE

01:33:08 A DEPRECIATION. HOW DOES THAT CHANGE THAT

01:33:11 PACIFIC RIM OBJECT -- RIM? WIN: IT IS A BIG DEAL.

01:33:20 SOME OF THE CALLS ABOUT THE EXCHANGE -- BUT BY THE MARKETS,

01:33:25 THAT EXCHANGE RATE, THE DOLLAR YOU WANT IS HIGHER.

01:33:36 -- DOLLAR YOUWAN IS HIGHER. IT IS A BIT OF A NO-BRAINER.

01:33:42 THE CHINESE OUTLOOK REMAINS CONCERNING.

01:33:48 DESPITE THE ANNOUNCEMENTS OVERNIGHT THAT POLICYMAKERS ARE

01:33:52 LOOKING FOR SUPPORT FOR THE PROPERTY SECTOR, I LIKEN THIS

01:33:53 TO A BAND-AID ON TOP OF THE GAPING WOUND.

01:33:55 THERE IS NO EASY WAY OUT. THERE IS MORE TALK ABOUT CHINA

01:34:00 GOING DOWN THE WAY OF JAPAN IN THE LAST DECADE.

01:34:03 THAT IS SOMETHING WHERE TO KEEP AN EYE ON.

01:34:08 BUT THE OUTLOOK FOR CHINA REMAINS NEGATIVE.

01:34:12 THAT HAS APPLICATION FOR GLOBAL MARKETS, EMERGING MARKETS AND

01:34:17 COMMODITIES. TOM:

01:34:18 IN YOUR STUDY OF INDIA, OVERTOOK BURMA, AROUND AND UP

01:34:21 TO JAPAN, TO YOU BY THE IDEA THAT THE LABOR COMPONENT OF

01:34:26 CHINA WILL BE MOVED TO VIETNAM? WIN:

01:34:32 THAT IS INTERESTING. THERE IS A DEBATE OF WHETHER

01:34:34 CHINA STILL QUALIFIES AS A DEVELOPING COUNTRY.

01:34:40 THAT IS A BIG DEBATE WITH ORGANIZATIONS.

01:34:42 YOU GET A FEW BENEFITS FROM BEING CLASSIFIED AS A

01:34:43 DEVELOPING ECONOMY. THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

01:34:57 IT IS THE COST OF BEING A FULLY DEVELOPED COUNTRY.

01:35:00 THERE ARE STILL ISSUES WITH MARKET MANIPULATION, ETC.

01:35:04 BUT FOR THE MOST PART CHINA HAS BEEN A BIG MOBILE DRIVER OF

01:35:06 GROWTH. IT IS FADING. WE ARE SEEING MORE OFF SHORING.

01:35:14 VIETNAM, INDIA, MEXICO. IT STANDS TO BENEFIT.

01:35:19 I WOULD NOT SAY IT IS DEGLOBALIZATION.

01:35:27 BUT AS CHINA PULLS MORE INWARD, MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS LOOK

01:35:28 FOR ALTERNATIVES FOR SUPPLY CHAIN'S AND ETC.

01:35:35 THE GLOBAL ECONOMY CANNOT COUNT ON CHINA BEING THE GLOBAL

01:35:36 DRIVER OF GROWTH RIGHT NOW.

01:35:43 LISA: PEOPLE ARE LOOKING TO THE U.S.

01:35:44 FOR A GLOBAL DRIVER. THERE'S A REASON EVERYBODY DOES

01:35:48 IS TAP DANCING. THE CPI REPORT, THERE IS A

01:35:54 FEELING THAT THE DOLLAR IS HEADED WEAKER EVEN THOUGH WE

01:35:57 ARE GETTING HAWKISH RHETORIC FROM FED OFFICIALS.

01:36:01 WHY DO YOU DISAGREE AND SEE POTENTIAL FOR A STRENGTHENING

01:36:03 DOLLAR AT A TIME WHEN PEOPLE ARE SEEING A DIVERGENCE WITH

01:36:07 THE U.S. SLOWING THE RATE HIKES AND

01:36:09 OTHERS CONTINUING TO DO IT MORE AGGRESSIVELY? WIN:

01:36:14 IT IS A QUESTION I'M BEING ASKED BY CLIENTS.

01:36:16 GIVEN HOW STRONG THE U.S. ON THE MENTAL, WHY IS THE

01:36:19 DAUGHTER -- DOLLAR NOT DOING BETTER?

01:36:24 IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE DOLLAR, WHAT DO YOU LIKE?

01:36:28 GERMANY IS TIPPING IN A RECESSION.

01:36:32 FRANCE AND ITALY ARE READING EVER RECESSION. THE U.K.

01:36:34 IS TIGHTENING. IT WILL GO INTO A DEEP

01:36:36 RECESSION. WHERE THE LAST MAN STANDING.

01:36:48 WE SHOULD BE DRAWING MORE INTERESTING ASSETS.

01:36:53 THE MARKET IS STARTING TO BELIEVE IT IS THERE.

01:36:55 THE SECOND OR THIRD HIKE. I STILL LOOK AT THIS WEAKNESS

01:36:59 AS A GIFT. I THINK IT SHOULD BE HIGHER.

01:37:05 BUT I CAN'T MAKE THE CASE FOR GOING MUCH LOWER.

01:37:08 RATE CUTS HAVING PRICED OUT FOR NEXT JUNE OR JULY.

01:37:12 THE PIECES ARE THERE FOR A STRONGER DOLLAR AND YET WE ARE

01:37:13 NOT SEEING IT.

01:37:20 I DON'T KNOW THE TRICK WILL BE, I STILL REMAIN CONFIDENT THAT

01:37:21 THE UNDERLYING STORY FOR THE DOLLAR IS STRONG.

01:37:25 EVENTUALLY THE MARKET PRICE WILL REFLECT THAT. LISA:

01:37:29 WHAT CROSS ARE YOU LOOKING AT, THE EURO-DOLLAR OR SOMETHING

01:37:32 ELSE WHERE WE WILL SEE IT COME TO THE FORE MORE? WIN:

01:37:42 THE BIGGEST PUZZLE IS IN THE DOLLAR-YEN.

01:37:46 NOW WE ARE DOWN AT 140. WE GO BACK TO MONETARY POLICY

01:37:49 DIVERGENCE, BANK OF JAPAN GOES NOWHERE. THE FED IS HIKING.

01:37:53 THAT SHOULD BE MUCH HIGHER. THAT IS THE BIGGEST PUZZLE.

01:38:00 IT SHOULD BE TOPPING AROUND 110, 111.

01:38:03 I CAN'T MAKE A BULLISH CASE FOR ANYTHING GOING ON IN EUROPE IN

01:38:09 TERMS OF ECONOMIES.

01:38:10 THOSE ARE THE ONES WHERE I LOOK AT THE MOST. JONATHAN:

01:38:16 I CAN'T MAKE A BULLISH CASE FOR WHAT IS HAPPENING IN EUROPE.

01:38:22 IT IS BETTER THAN PEOPLE EXPECTED SIX MONTHS, NINE

01:38:25 MONTHS AGO. LISA: THAT IS WHERE WE ARE AT.

01:38:28 I HAVE TO GIVE A BIT OF A CORRECTION.

01:38:30 I WAS UNAWARE TOM CRUISE DID HIS OWN STUNTS.

01:38:35 HE IS 61 YEARS OLD, HE DROVE A MOTORCYCLE OFF A RAMP LIKE

01:38:38 CLIFF IN THE AUSTRIAN ALPS.

01:38:44 HE DID THIS HIMSELF? IT IS A DEATHWATCH.

01:38:50 DO YOU WANT TO BE DOING THAT? JONATHAN:

01:38:54 AT 61, I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. LISA:

01:38:57 WOULD YOU WANT TO DO THAT NOW? JONATHAN: NO.

01:39:00 BUT I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO DO IT AT 61.

01:39:05 SOMETHING TOM SAID EARLIER, I HAVE MADE A CAREER OF THIS.

01:39:09 STEPHEN WHO YOU QUOTED EARLIER, STEPHEN WAS TELLING ANNMARIE

01:39:14 THAT HE ENJOYS HER TIME -- TIMELY AND BALANCE REPORTING ON

01:39:19 THE ISSUES. IT WAS NOT FOR US.

01:39:22 JUST TO BE CLEAR. SHE IS COMING UP WITH MARIA

01:39:26 TADEO SHORTLY. ARE YOU WATCHING TENNIS?

01:39:34 IT IS SO SPECIAL. KICK YESTERDAY FROM WIMBLEDON.

01:39:55 >> I DON'T THINK THE FED IS GOING TO WAIT AROUND.

01:39:57 >> THIS IS NOT A CREDIT CRUNCH RECESSION.

01:40:00 >> WHAT IS GOING TO BREAK THE EQUITY MARKETS?

01:40:04 >> I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE MORE TREMORS.

01:40:08 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE WITH JONATHAN

01:40:11 FERRO, LISA ABRAMOWICZ AND TOM KEENE. TOM:

01:40:15 GOOD MORNING, ON TELEVISION AND RADIO, IT IS THE SLOWEST

01:40:18 TUESDAY SINCE TIME BEGAN. MARKETS FROZEN.

01:40:22 WAITING FOR CPI WEDNESDAY. I AM LOOKING AT THE SCREEN AND

01:40:28 STRUGGLING TO GET TO 8:30 TOMORROW MORNING. JONATHAN:

01:40:32 THERE IS A FEELING AGAINST TOMORROW, THE ECONOMIC DATA

01:40:34 ONTO CPI, BPI. FOR MANY, THE WEEK MIGHT BEGIN

01:40:37 ON FRIDAY. EARNINGS SEASON KICKING OFF

01:40:42 WITH THE BIG BANK, WELLS FARGO.

01:40:48 LET'S SEE IF WE GET SOME INSIGHT INTO THE U.S.

01:40:49 ECONOMY IN A FEW DAYS. TOM: ALL IN ALL, IT IS THIS IDEA IN

01:40:56 THE ZEITGEIST OF RECESSION ANALYSIS VERSUS SOFT LANDING

01:40:59 ANALYSIS. NOT THAT I KNOW WHAT A SOFT

01:41:02 LANDING IS. I DON'T RECALL BUT IN THE

01:41:05 TEXTBOOKS. JONATHAN: RECESSION DELAY NOT AVOIDED.

01:41:12 THAT IS THE TAKE OVER AT APOLLO. THE LACK OF FED HIKES WILL CALM

01:41:16 DOWN.

01:41:22 THE LIGHT OF JOHN WILLIAMS AND THE NEW YORK FED, THE FINANCIAL

01:41:24 TIMES.

01:41:32 HE SAYS RECESSION IS WAY MORE LIKELY.

01:41:36 IN THE BASE CASE IT IS NOT A RECESSION, IT IS SLOWER GROWTH.

01:41:48 TOM: DR. WILLIAMS IS QUALIFIED TO

01:41:50 TALK ABOUT THIS AND THAT OF SOMEONE WE WILL LISTEN TO.

01:41:56 BUT PARTITIONING THE RECESSION IS ABOUT AS USELESS AS THE FED

01:42:01 -- >> WHO IN THIS MARKET IS WAITING FOR A GROUP OF GUYS AT

01:42:07 THE NPR TO TURN THIS OVER? THAT WAS IT. LISA:

01:42:12 WE START SAYING IT IS TOTALLY DEAD, DON'T COME TO WORK.

01:42:16 THEN MAYBE COME TO WORK TOMORROW, MAYBE WEDNESDAY.

01:42:17 COME ON FRIDAY. THEN GO ON VACATION UNTIL JULY

01:42:24 26 IN THE -- WHEN THE FOMC DELIVERS THEIR RATE HIKING

01:42:25 MASTICATION'S. THERE IS INTERESTING DATA

01:42:29 COMING OUT IN THE MARGINS. THE CONSUMER CREDIT DATA THAT

01:42:35 CAME OUT YESTERDAY FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE.

01:42:41 TO BUY HOMES, YOU ARE SEEING THAT COMING DOWN.

01:42:42 BUT PEOPLE ARE STILL USING CRITIC CARDS.

01:42:46 SMALL BUSINESSES ARE RAISING PRICES AT THE SLOWEST PACE

01:42:50 GOING BACK TO THE HEAT OF THE PANDEMIC BUT THEY ARE THINKING

01:42:51 OF RAISING THEM MORE LATER. THESE ARE GOING TO SUGGEST THIS

01:42:56 IN THE SHORT TERM. BUT IT READS A QUESTION IN THE

01:43:01 LONG-TERM. TOM: SHORT-TERM, MEDIUM-TERM AND

01:43:06 LONGER-TERM, I WILL GET IT UP HERE. FOMC GO.

01:43:15 IT'S GET TO THE MEDIUM-TERM OF NOVEMBER 20.

01:43:19 THESE WILL BE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL MEETINGS GIVEN THE

01:43:22 INFLATION REPORTS. JONATHAN: I AM GOING TO SHORED UP FOR

01:43:27 THE FED DECISION. LIKE SPORTS COMMENTATORS.

01:43:34 TOM: YOU CAN SEE THIS WHILE POWELL

01:43:35 IS TALKING. I FELL ASLEEP LAST TIME.

01:43:39 THEN WE COME BACK ON AND IT SOUNDS LIKE WE HAVE HUNG ON

01:43:42 EVERY WORD. JONATHAN:

01:43:48 WE BOTH CAME IN AT THE LOWEST FOR SOMETHING LIKE TWO YEARS.

01:43:51 CAN IT MEAN WHATEVER YOU WANTED TO MEAN? LISA: ABSOLUTELY.

01:43:59 IT IS INFORMATION THAT SHOWS WHY YOU CAN SEE IT DECLINE IN

01:44:01 AUTO PRICES. PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO BORROW

01:44:04 THESE RATES AT A TIME WHEN CAR PRICES ARE GOING UP AT THE SAME

01:44:10 RATE. YOUR UNDERWATER ON AUTO LOANS.

01:44:12 YOU ARE SEEING THAT INCREASINGLY AS COMPANIES DROP

01:44:18 PRICES ON CARS WHERE PEOPLE ARE OWED TO TAKE THE HIGHER PRICE.

01:44:21 IT IS RAISING DISCOMFORT WITH THESE RATES OVER THE LONGER

01:44:23 TERM. BUT TO YOUR POINT, IT ALSO MEANS PEOPLE HAVE CASH AND THEY

01:44:26 CAN SPEND IT. JONATHAN:

01:44:32 IF THAT WAS THE OTHER NUMBER, PEOPLE WOULD SAY THEY GOT TO,

01:44:33 THINGS ARE TOUGH. LISA: ALTHOUGH DO PEOPLE WANT TO

01:44:38 BORROW AT THAT RATE TO BUY LUXURY CARS?

01:44:42 THAT IS THE REAL THEME. TOM: THE CAR LOANS, HOME MORTGAGES,

01:44:47 CAR LOANS HAVE BALLOONED.

01:44:53 LISA: YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE HIGHEST

01:44:54 PAYMENTS THAT PEOPLE ARE MAKING TO OWN CARS GOING BACK IN THE

01:44:56 RECORDS. TOM: I AM LOOKING AT THIS CREEP AWAY

01:45:01 FROM LOW PRICES. JONATHAN: THE FUTURES SLIGHTLY POSITIVE.

01:45:09 WE SAW THE DOLLARS KICK IN OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS.

01:45:16 BREAKING 110 ON THE EURO.

01:45:22 TOM: THIS IS INTELLIGENT FOR NORTHWESTERN MUTUAL.

01:45:31 BRENT SCHUTTE JOINS US.

01:45:37 YOU LOOK ABROAD AT THE DEVELOPED NATION EQUITY IS AND

01:45:43 YOU SEE -- YOU SAY THAT THEY ARE REMARKABLE ACHIEVE.

01:45:45 WE ARE BEGINNING TO HEAR THIS IN OUR ANALYSIS.

01:45:49 WHAT EQUITIES ABROAD ARE REMARKABLY CHEAP? BRENT:

01:45:52 MANY PARTS OF THE MARKET. SOMETIMES EARNINGS ARE MARKED

01:45:57 DOWN 10 OR 15%. I COMPARE THIS TO THE U.S.

01:46:01 EQUITIES, WHERE EVERYONE HAS WANTED TO BE.

01:46:04 AND THEY HAVE TIMES EARNINGS. YOU MENTIONED SHORT, MID AND

01:46:07 LONG TERM. I'M A PESSIMIST. I THINK A

01:46:11 RECESSION IS LIKELY. NARRATIVE HAS CHANGED AND IT

01:46:16 PUTS A WHITE BLANKET ON EQUITIES IN THE NEAR TERM.

01:46:21 BUT I DO THINK THE PARTS OF THE MARKET THAT ARE CHEAP WILL DO

01:46:27 WELL COMING OUT OF A SHORT AND SHALLOW RECESSION.

01:46:30 I ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO POSITION MORE TOWARD THAT.

01:46:35 AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES.

01:46:41 TOM: ARE THERE TECH GROWTH PERFORMERS IN THE MID-CAP AREA?

01:46:48 BRENT: YES, BUT HOW MUCH YOU PAY FOR

01:46:49 THAT? IT REMINDS ME OF 1999, 2 THOUSAND, WERE THAT WAS THE

01:46:54 NARRATIVE.

01:47:02 I KNOW NOT EVERY TIME IN HISTORY RHYMES.

01:47:09 LISA: IT WAS ALMOST SILLY TO DISCUSS

01:47:11 RECESSION, THE GLOOM AND DEAL.

01:47:19 THE DATA SHOWED A STRONG ECONOMY.

01:47:22 HOW DO YOU PARLAY THAT INTO A SHALLOW RECESSION THAT COULD

01:47:27 AMELIORATE SOME OF THE INFLATIONARY PRESSURES ENOUGH

01:47:30 TO KEEP GROWTH GOING ON THIS SEE ERIC?

01:47:32 DO THINK THAT IS THE MOST LIKELY OUTCOME AT A TIME WHEN

01:47:38 THERE IS STILL THIS PRESSURE?

01:47:45 BRENT: IT IS HIGHLY LINKED TO COVID IN

01:47:51 THE REARVIEW MIRROR.

01:47:53 BUT THE BIG CONCERN IS -- UNLESS PEOPLE COME BACK TO

01:47:59 LABOR MARKET. IF YOU LOOK HISTORICALLY, THE

01:48:02 FED HIKES RATES AGGRESSIVELY AS WAGES REACH 4%.

01:48:08 THAT IS WHERE THE LAST ECONOMIC CYCLES HAVE ENDED.

01:48:12 I DON'T THINK THE FED STOPS UNTIL THEY SEE THE LABOR MARKET

01:48:14 CRACK. I LOOK AT THE LIQUIDITY TOURNIQUET ON THE U.S.

01:48:19 ECONOMY AND THAT MEANS A RECESSION IS LIKELY IN THE

01:48:20 COMING QUARTERS.

01:48:26 THE GOOD NEWS IS I BELIEVE UNLESS THE RATE HAS CHANGED

01:48:31 FROM TWO POINT 5%, WE ARE ABOVE FIVE. THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM IF

01:48:35 INFLATION HAS GONE TO CUT RATES, TO CUSHION THE BLOW.

01:48:40 THE CONSUMER STILL HAS AMPLE SAVINGS AND LIKELY WILL AFTER

01:48:41 THIS. LISA: WHAT KEEPS YOU UP AT NIGHT THAT

01:48:48 COULD CHALLENGE THAT ASSUMPTION, TO SOMETHING THAT

01:48:50 LOOKS MORE TRADITIONAL IN TERMS OF RECESSION? BRENT:

01:48:53 THE FED KEEPS HIKING. I WORRY WHEN THE LABOR MARKET

01:49:00 COMES UP AND SHOWS ITS STRENGTH, THEY WANT TO SEE A

01:49:01 COMPLETE AND GONE. THEY PROBABLY ALREADY GONE TOO

01:49:04 FAR. IF THEY CONTINUE TO GO FACE ON

01:49:10 A BELIEF THAT INFLATION IS NOT COMPLETELY BACK TO PERCENT,

01:49:12 EVERY SIGN POINTS TO THAT DIRECTION.

01:49:15 IF THEY GO FURTHER AND FURTHER UNTIL THEY GET THE LABOR MARKET

01:49:18 TO CRACK, YOU COULD SEE SOMETHING DEEPER. JONATHAN:

01:49:21 YOU SAID SUPPOSE IT STRENGTH. IS THERE MORE TO THE LABOR

01:49:24 MARKET THAT MEETS THE EYE? BRENT:

01:49:28 PEOPLE LOOK AT THE DATA AND IT IS ODD.

01:49:32 HE SAW HOUSEHOLD EMPLOYMENT FOR MANY MONTHS THE FLAT.

01:49:39 FEBRUARY 2 NOVEMBER LAST YEAR, IT WAS 200,000 TOTAL.

01:49:42 THIS RECESSION COMMENTARY, DOES ANYBODY REALIZE THAT MOST

01:49:47 MASTIC INCOME HAS BEEN NEGATIVE FOR TWO QUARTERS?

01:49:49 THAT IS THE OPPOSITE OF GROSS PRODUCT.

01:49:56 -- GROSS DOMESTIC INCOME AND THE OPPOSITE OF GROSS DOMESTIC

01:49:59 PRODUCT. THEY WON'T STOP UNTIL THEY SEE

01:50:03 IT WEAKENING AND HOPEFULLY THEY DON'T GO TOO FAR AND WANT IT TO

01:50:06 WEAKEN SO SUBSTANTIALLY IT CAUSES A RECESSION. JONATHAN:

01:50:17 HOW HARD IS IT TO -- RIGHT: I'M -- BRENT: FOR PEOPLE WHO

01:50:26 INVESTED IN BONDS FOR YEARS, THE RACE ON THE BOND INDEX,

01:50:29 THEY ARE NOT 5%. YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:50:35 HEDGE YOUR PORTFOLIO BY INVESTING IN BONDS WHICH OFFER

01:50:37 REAL VALUE WHEN INFLATION IS GOING BACK TO 2%.

01:50:43 AND IT WILL HEDGE AGAINST EQUITIES, RETURNED TO THE

01:50:47 HISTORICAL ROLE OF BALANCING THE DOWNSIDE OF EQUITY MARKETS.

01:50:51 JONATHAN: THANK YOU SIR, APPRECIATE IT.

01:51:01 FROM NORTHWESTERN MUTUAL. YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER ONE. LISA:

01:51:07 I HAVE BECOME LESS BEARISH.

01:51:14 I THINK THERE IS THIS CONCERN ABOUT INFLATION GOING BACK TO

01:51:16 THE 2% LEVEL EASILY. THAT IS THE REAL DISTINCTION

01:51:17 NOW. TOM: IT IS A GOOD THING.

01:51:25 LISA: THE FED ITSELF, THEY SAID THEY

01:51:26 ARE COMMITTED TO 2%. DO THEY HAVE ENOUGH ON THAT

01:51:30 LAST MILE?

01:51:36 TOM: I THINK HE HAS AN INTERESTING

01:51:37 PERSPECTIVE. THE UNAPPOINTED RATE IN

01:51:40 MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN IS 2.4%. IT USED TO BE FIVE, 6%.

01:51:48 JONATHAN: I GOT A MESSAGE FROM HIS OF

01:51:50 SCRIBER, NOW SHE TELLS US. WELCOME TO THE SHOW.

01:51:58 THE S&P 500 POSITIVE BY 0.2%.

01:52:04 ABOUT 18 MINUTES FROM NOW, A FORMER FED ECONOMIST, WE MIGHT

01:52:08 HAVE HEARD ABOUT THAT RULE. TOM: A HUGE SPLASH RIGHT NOW.

01:52:13 SHE HAS EARNED THIS. IT IS COURT RESEARCH FROM A PHD

01:52:18 AT THE FED WHO HAS GONE ON TO BIGGER THINGS.

01:52:23 SHE IS GETTING MAJOR LOVE WITH THE ECONOMICS COMMUNITY ABOUT

01:52:28 THE GRANULARITY OF A RECESSION CALL AND SET OF THE AGGREGATE

01:52:29 FOOLISHNESS. JONATHAN: LET'S GET TO THAT BRIEFLY.

01:52:34 3.5% UNEMPLOYMENT. YOU HEARD BRENT, SUPPOSE THE

01:52:38 STRENGTH. HE IS NOT ON BOARD WITH THE

01:52:42 IDEA THAT THIS LABOR MARKET IS DOING REALLY WELL. TOM:

01:52:46 IF YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB, IT IS DOING TERRIBLE.

01:52:49 IF YOU HAVE A JOB, ONWARD AND FORWARD.

01:52:52 BUT THE AGGREGATE VIEW AWAY

01:52:58 FROM THE BIG CITIES, SUB 3% EMPLOYMENT IS EXTRAORDINARY.

01:53:01 WE HAVE NEVER SEEN THAT. JONATHAN:

01:53:04 LOOKING FORWARD TO THE HOUSING MARKET CONVERSATION WITH YOU

01:53:09 GUYS. JONATHAN MILLER, THE PRESIDENT

01:53:11 AND CEO OF MILLER SAMUEL, THAT TAKING PLACE IN ABOUT 30

01:53:15 MINUTES. IT IS SO INTERESTING IN AMERICA, MORTGAGE RATES SURGING

01:53:17 THROUGH 7% OVER THE LAST 18 MONTHS.

01:53:19 YET HOUSING IS RECOVERING. LISA: A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE BUYING WITH

01:53:26 CASH, A GREATER PROPORTION WITH CASH.

01:53:29 ARE THEY NOT TAKING OUT LOANS BECAUSE THEY ARE CONCERNED

01:53:32 ABOUT THE RATE, OR BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO? TOM:

01:53:39 HOW MANY PEOPLE DO I KNOW WHO ARE BUYING HOUSES WITH CASH?

01:53:41 JONATHAN: THEY ARE ALL YOUR MATES.

01:53:57 1 >> THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN TRYING TO ENSURE THAT

01:54:00 THIS CONFLICT DOES NOT BECOME A WORLD WAR III AND DOES NOT

01:54:01 ESCALATE.

01:54:07 THIS TIES INTO THE MEMBERSHIP THOUGH, AND IS ATTACKED AGAINST

01:54:08 ONE AND ALL. THE IDEA IF IT WAS BROUGHT INTO

01:54:14 NATO OFFICIALLY WHILE THE CONFLICT IS STILL RAGING, WITH

01:54:16 THAT COMMIT THE U.S. AND -- TO BE INVOLVED IN A WAY

01:54:20 THAT MOST ARE NOT READY. JONATHAN:

01:54:26 CONTROVERSIAL DECISIONS BEING MADE AT THE NATO SUMMIT.

01:54:29 THE CODIRECTOR AT THE CENTER ON U.S.

01:54:32 POLITICS, WEIGHING IN ON THE NATO SUMMIT.

01:54:35 TAKING PLACE IN LITHUANIA.

01:54:43 AN IMPORTANT? -- TOM: AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION.

01:54:49 THE SOCIALIST SPANISH MINISTER

01:54:56 USES A PRIVATE JET -- JONATHAN: CAN YOU VERIFY?

01:55:01 SHE GETS ON A BIKE TO RIDE IT. TOM: BRILLIANT.

01:55:09 JONATHAN: INFURIATING. MARIA WOULD NOT.

01:55:16 WE THINK MORE OF MARIA THAN THAT.

01:55:22 TOM: THIS IS ONE OF THE THREE BALTIC

01:55:25 STATES, IT IS EXTRA ORDINARY. I DID NOT EXPECT THIS, I WAS

01:55:31 WAY OUT FRONT WITH ANNMARIE HORDERN FOR THE PRESIDENT OF

01:55:36 THE U.S..

01:55:37 ST. PETERSBURG SEEMS ONLY. 240 MILES FROM HELSINKI BY FERRY TO

01:55:44 ST. PETERSBURG. I GOT FINLAND NATO, SWEDEN NATO.

01:55:47 HOW ALONE IS ST. PETERSBURG AT THE VERY END OF THE GULF OF

01:55:49 FINLAND? MARIA:

01:55:55 TO MAKE IT CLEAR, I WOULD NOT DO THAT.

01:55:59 IF YOU ARE A POLITICIAN, YOU FLY RYANAIR, YOU PUT THE

01:56:02 PICTURE ON TWITTER AND YOU SAY I AM A MAN OF THE PEOPLE, A

01:56:03 WOMAN OF THE PEOPLE. BUT BEYOND THE SPANISH MINISTER

01:56:09 WHO WAS TROUBLE FOR THAT PICTURE BY THE WAY, THAT IS THE

01:56:11 MESSAGE THAT NATO WANTS TO SEND. THIS IS AN ALLIANCE THAT IS

01:56:15 STRONGER THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN.

01:56:19 NOW PRESIDENT ERDOGAN DROPPED THEIR VETO.

01:56:23 SWEDEN EXPECTED TO JOIN THE ALLIANCE.

01:56:27 THEY SAY WE ARE AS POWERFUL AS WE HAVE EVER BEEN. TOM:

01:56:33 IT SEEMS LIKE A COMBUSTIBLE MOMENT.

01:56:34 IN YOUR REPORTING WITH THE TEAM AND THE PRESIDENT, ARE THEY

01:56:38 WORRIED ABOUT THE PUTIN RESPONSE?

01:56:44 ANNMARIE: THEY HAVE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT

01:56:45 ESCALATING THE WAR MORE. MANY CRITICS SAY THAT BIDEN

01:56:51 ADMINISTRATION DRAGS THEIR FEET WHEN IT COMES TO FRESH WEAPONS

01:56:54 AND THE LATEST LIST ZELENSKYY IS ASKING FOR TO UKRAINE.

01:57:04 POTENTIALLY, IF PUTIN FEELS

01:57:11 LIKE HE HAS TO DOUBLE DOWN -- IF THIS BECOMES TO A POINT

01:57:14 WHERE WE COULD SEE PUTIN MAYBE USE A TACTICAL NUCLEAR WEAPON

01:57:17 IN UKRAINE. THIS IS OBVIOUS CONCERN NOT

01:57:23 JUST FOR THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION BUT NATO WRIT

01:57:27 LARGE, THEY HAVE CHANGED THE NUCLEAR POSTURE.

01:57:32 WHAT THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO PRESENT, THIS IS A WIN, NOT

01:57:38 JUST FOR THE ALLIANCE AND THE SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE, BUT THE

01:57:40 FOREIGN POLICY. HE WILL SAY WHAT PUTIN WANTED

01:57:45 TO DO WAS DIVIDE NATO AND WHAT HE IS DONE BY HIS INVASION OF

01:57:50 UKRAINE WAS A THE ALLIANCE AND EXPANDED.

01:57:52 NOW YOU HAVE FINLAND AND SWEDEN GOING TO BE TWO NEW MEMBERS OF

01:57:54 THIS GROUP. LISA:

01:58:00 AND THE FACT THAT SWEDEN WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE UNION,

01:58:04 FINLAND IS A MEMBER ALSO THE QUESTION AROUND TURKEY.

01:58:09 THE WILLINGNESS TO ALLOW SWEDEN -- WHAT QUESTIONS REMAIN TO BE

01:58:15 ESTABLISHED THROUGH THE REMAINING 24 HOURS AT THIS

01:58:21 MEETING ECHO -- MEETING? ANNMARIE:

01:58:27 THE REAL QUESTION WILL BE INVOLVING UKRAINE.

01:58:31 BIDEN SAID HE AGREED WITH THE LANGUAGE PUT FORWARD FOR

01:58:35 UKRAINE, REGARDING THEIR INVITATION INTO NATO.

01:58:39 BUT THERE WAS A STRONGLY WORDED TWEET FROM ZELENSKYY SAYING IT

01:58:43 IS ABSURD, WHAT HE IS HEARING ABOUT THE NATO SUMMIT AS HE IS

01:58:51 IN ROUTE TO THE SUMMIT, HE SAID UKRAINE IS BEING DISCUSSED

01:58:52 WITHOUT UKRAINE AT THE TABLE AND HE THINKS IT IS

01:58:56 UNPRECEDENTED AND ABSURD THAT THERE IS NO SPECIFIC TIMELINE

01:59:00 FOR UKRAINE TO JOIN THE ALLIANCE OR EVEN FOR THE

01:59:02 INVITATION TO JOIN. HOW THE WORLD LEADERS TALK

01:59:09 ABOUT MAKING SURE THEY ARE 100% BEHIND UKRAINE, WANT TO

01:59:13 STRENGTHEN THE ALLIANCE, BUT NOT HAVE A SPECIFIC TIMEFRAME

01:59:16 FOR UKRAINE, THAT IS GOING TO BE ONE OF THE BIGGER

01:59:19 POT
