00:12 >> THE DEPTH AND BREATH OF SUPPLIES ACROSS THE BOARD AND

00:14 IT'S A MUCH MORE RESILIENT ECONOMY.

00:18 >> WE ARE NOT SEEING ANY SIGNS OF CONSUMER HANGOVER YET.

00:23 >> I THINK YOU STILL HAVE TO ARGUE IT'S PRETTY BROAD.

00:28 >> AS EARNINGS BECOME CLEAR IT'S WHERE WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON.

00:33 >> THE IMPORTANT THING IS THE SOFT LANDING IS CONTINUING.

00:38 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE WITH JONATHAN

00:41 FERRO, LISA ABRAMOWICZ AND ANNMARIE HORDERN. JONATHAN:

00:44 FOR OUR AUDIENCE WORLDWIDE, GOOD MORNING, THIS IS BLOOMBERG

00:45 SURVEILLANCE.

00:46 EN JONATHAN FERRO, YOUR EQUITY MARKET IS BOUNCING BACK ON THE

00:51 S&P 500. WE BEGIN BY TALKING ABOUT A

00:56 SINGLE NAME IN THE PREMARKET. YOU'VE SPENT HOURS, DAYS GOING

01:02 OVER YOUR EARNINGS REPORT AND THEN YOU RELEASE IT AND SAY

01:06 MARGINS ARE GOING TO INCREASE 500 BASIS POINTS.

01:12 THE STOCK SURGES, YOU GET ON THE CALL AND SAY I MEANT 50,

01:14 NOT 500. LISA:

01:22 IS THIS JUST LYFT BEING A PECULIAR COMPANY OR IS THIS

01:23 SOMETHING THIS MORNING FARIAS. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAYING A

01:28 CLERICAL ERROR IT'S NOT NECESSARILY SECURITIES FRAUD.

01:32 CAN YOU IMAGINE IF YOU ARE ON THE OTHERS THAT? JONATHAN:

01:35 THE NUMBERS WERE QUITE GOOD. THEY ARE TALKING MORE ABOUT THE

01:40 RESULTS THEMSELVES THAN THEY ARE THE SHOCKER OF SAYING 500

01:42 AND THEY MEANT 50. ANNMARIE: THEY DID REALLY -- LISA:

01:48 THEY DID REALLY WELL, INCLUDING PROJECTED EARNINGS AS MUCH AS

01:54 11% HIGHER.

01:55 WHY WOULD THEY HAVE TWO MUDDY IT UP WITH SOMETHING THAT SO

01:59 DISTRACTING AND JUST STEALING THE HEADLINES WITH UNNECESSARY

02:00 SORT OF DISMAY. JONATHAN: IT'S WORTH A COUPLE OF SECONDS

02:05 PRAYED WHERE WOULD THE STOCK BE THIS MORNING WITHOUT THAT

02:08 TAKING PLACE YESTERDAY AFTERNOON? LISA: UP 21%?

02:12 IT WOULD BE HIGHER. YOU HAVE TO WONDER WHAT

02:17 MANAGEMENT IS DOING IF THEY ALLOW THIS TO GO THROUGH.

02:20 IT RAISES SOME EXTRA QUESTIONS THEY DID NOT NEED. JONATHAN:

02:25 NO EXTRA ZEROS HERE WHATSOEVER. LET'S TURN TO THE BROADER

02:28 MARKET. YIELDS MUCH HIGHER.

02:34 THE TWO-YEAR, 460. INFLATION YESTERDAY A WHOLE CPI

02:40 REPORT MIGHT NOT BE ENOUGH FOR THE STORY THE FED IS TELLING.

02:42 ANNMARIE: I LOVE -- LISA: I LOVE SOME OF THE COMMENTARY.

02:50 SAYING GOLDILOCKS IN THE FIRST GOT PUNCH.

02:52 BASICALLY TALKING ABOUT HOW EVERYONE WAS TALKING ABOUT A

02:56 SOFT LANDING THE NARRATIVE STARTS TO SHIFT, THAT HOT

02:57 LANDING TYPE OF SCENARIO. YOU SEE THE MARKET AND YOU SEE

03:04 THESE ANALYSTS PUSHING BACK EXPECTATIONS FOR RATE CUTS AND

03:07 TALKING ABOUT HOW THE BROADENING OUT OF INFLATION IS

03:09 THE WRONG THING THE FED WANTS TO SEE.

03:15 ANNMARIE: THIS ALSO HAD POLITICAL

03:17 RAMIFICATIONS BECAUSE YOU HAD THESE CATEGORIES GOING UP,

03:22 FOOD, DINING OUT, ENERGY BILLS WHEN IT COMES TO ELECTRICITY.

03:26 WHICH SHOCKED ME WAS THE GEM IN THIS REPORT WAS SUMMING THAT

03:28 WAS DOGGING THE ADMINISTRATION. CAN YOU IMAGINE THOUGH IF

03:33 GASOLINE PRICES WERE TO TAKE IN SOME OF THAT RISK OR SOMETHING

03:35 BIGGER HAPPENED? JONATHAN: EXPECTATIONS WERE PRETTY

03:41 ELEVATED THAT ALL OF THIS WOULD FADE AWAY QUICKLY.

03:45 THE FUND MANAGER SURVEY WE TALKED ABOUT THE MOST

03:47 OPTIMISTIC GLOBAL GROWTH IN TWO YEARS.

03:51 MAGNIFICENT SENTIMENT, ONLY 7% EXPECTED TO CUT HIGHER PRICING

03:58 PRESSURE. LISA:

03:59 WHICH IS THE REASON WE SAW THE BIGGEST MOVE IN SMALL CAPS

04:02 YESTERDAY WHICH WAS THE BIGGEST GOING BACK TO JUNE OF 2022.

04:05 A KNEE-JERK REACTION. DRIVEN BY THE SHORTS AND PEOPLE

04:10 COMING OUT WHO WERE ONE SIDED TO THE SOFT LANDING NARRATIVE.

04:15 DO WE SEE THIS SHIFT WITH PEOPLE COMING IN AND BUYING WHO

04:18 HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY OR DO YOU START

04:22 TO SEE A MORE SIGNIFICANT NARRATIVE SHIFT ABOUT THE

04:24 BROADENING OUT OF INFLATION PRESSURES WHICH IS OPPOSITE OF

04:28 WHAT THE FED HAS TO SEE AND WHAT THE FED HAS TO DO TO

04:33 COUNTER THAT.

04:34 >> BROADER EQUITIES, EQUITY FUTURES ON THE S&P 500 POSITIVE

04:37 BY ONE THIRD OF 1%. YIELDS YESTERDAY ARE HIGHER.

04:40 DOWN TWO BASIS POINTS.

04:46 COMING UP THIS HOUR, RUSS FOLLOWING YESTERDAY'S SELF.

04:50 A STANDOFF IN THE HOUSE OVER EIGHT TO ISRAEL AND UKRAINE.

04:55 AND SARAH WOLF ON THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY AND RETAIL SALES

04:56 COMING LATER THIS WEEK. THAT STORY OUT THE BACK OF A

05:01 SELLOFF IN BUSINESS, PUSHING THE RED -- FATE -- FED RATE

05:04 CUTS. HOLDING ON TO JUNE SAYING THE

05:10 CPI WHILE INFLATION IS DECELERATING IT WOULD NOT BE A

05:13 STRAIGHT PATH WE CONTINUE TO SEE JUNE WE ARE EXPECTING THREE

05:18 RATHER THAN 45 CUTS THIS YEAR. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE DATA THIS

05:23 MORNING. IS THAT ENOUGH TO DERAIL THE

05:29 GOLDILOCKS SOFT LANDING OF 2024? >> I DON'T THINK SO.

05:34 THE NUMBER WAS A BIT HOT.

05:40 WE WERE EXPECTING .39. CLEARLY THE WRONG DIRECTION,

05:45 THERE IS SOME ESTIMATION AROUND THIS AND I THINK THE BROADER

05:49 ISSUE INFLATION IS GETTING LOWER BUT THERE ARE PARTS ON

05:50 THE SERVICE SIDE THAT ARE STICKY.

05:55 WE SAW THAT AGAIN WITH RENT AND WHILE IT'S GOING TO GO DOWN

05:58 IT'S NOT SLIDING AS FAST AS THE MARKET HAD EXPECTED WHICH -- AS

06:04 QUICKLY AS YOU NEEDED IT TO TO VALIDATE THAT IN LATE 2023 THAT

06:07 THEY WOULD START CUTTING IN MARCH.

06:08 WE SEE THAT THE FED WILL BEGIN CUTTING LATE THIS SPRING OR

06:11 THIS SUMMER. WE STILL THINK MAYBE THREE OR

06:14 FOUR CUTS ARE LIKELY.

06:20 AGAIN IT'S NOT TO BE A STRAIGHT LINE AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE

06:21 POINTS WHERE YOU GET A BIT OF THE BACKUP.

06:27 TAKING SOME AIR OUT OF THAT HOT EXPECTATION WE HAD BACK IN LATE

06:28 2023. JONATHAN: LET'S TAKE STOCK OF WHERE THE

06:33 ECONOMIC MESS IS. MAYBE SHELTER INFLATION A

06:38 LITTLE BIT STICKIER AS WELL. IS THAT BAD FOR BOTH STOCKS AND

06:44 BONDS OR BETTER THAN ONE VERSUS THE OTHER. RUSS:

06:49 YESTERDAY WAS TOUGH FOR THE BOND MARKET, STOCKS TOOK THEIR

06:55 CUE FROM BONDS. THE FLIPSIDE OF THIS IS WE HAVE

07:01 AN ECONOMY AT TWO .5% INFLATION AT 2024 AND WE GET ANOTHER 2%

07:04 GROWTH ON THE LOW SIDE. IF YOU'VE GOT 4.5% NOMINAL GDP

07:10 DOES A DECENT SHOT AT EARNINGS ESTIMATES WILL PROBABLY BE A

07:11 BIT TOO LOW. SO I THINK THAT DESPITE

07:17 YESTERDAY'S ACTION THE STOCK MARKET IS PROBABLY GOOD TO BE

07:18 DECENT FOR U.S. EQUITIES. WE CAN PROBABLY PUT ANOTHER 6%

07:25 OR 7% YEAR-TO-DATE AND THERE'S REASON TO STAY LONG EQUITIES.

07:31 LISA: IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE SOME OF

07:33 THE MORE CYCLICALLY EXPOSED STOCKS AND I'M THINKING SMALL

07:38 CAPS HAVE GOTTEN MORE AND MORE BEATEN UP THE MORE PEOPLE PUSH

07:40 BACK EXPECTATIONS FOR RATE CUTS. WHEN DOES THAT STOP?

07:48 >> LAST YEAR YOU HAD THIS DRIVEN RALLY IN NOVEMBER,

07:49 DECEMBER. IN SMALL CAPS BENEFIT. THE PROBLEM FOR SMALL CAPS IS

07:57 IT'S AN ODD POINT IN THE CYCLE TO GET ON SMALL CAPS THE

08:00 QUALITY IS MUCH LOWER THAN THE LARGE MEGA CAPS.

08:06 WE SAW YESTERDAY THAT ARE RATE SENSITIVE.

08:09 WE HAVE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE RATES AREN'T FALLING AS QUICKLY

08:13 AS THE MARKET BELIEVED SMALL CAPS, EARLY GROWTH.

08:14 THESE PARTS OF THE MARKET ARE SENSITIVE.

08:18 THE SHORT ANSWER IS WE ARE STILL LONG MAYBE IN THE MEGA

08:23 CAP TECH GAINS THAT ARE HIGHER QUALITY.

08:25 WE THINK BENEFIT FROM LONGER SECTOR THEMES.

08:29 THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF PARTS OF THE MARKETS IN AIRLINES,

08:34 AUTOS, PARTS OF THE CONSUMER SECTOR LITTER PRETTY CHEAP

08:39 DESPITE WHERE THE MARKET TRADE IS AT.

08:45 THERE IS SOME VALUE THERE. LISA: HOW UNDERWEIGHT BONDS ARE YOU?

08:50 RUSS: WE ARE STILL A LITTLE BIT UNDERWEIGHT BONDS.

08:54 MAYBE HALF THE YEAR TO THE BENCHMARK, WE HAVE BEEN

08:58 CAUTIOUS. WE DO THINK SPREAD OUT ASSETS

09:01 LOOK GOOD. PROBABLY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO

09:06 SEE FOR 15 YEARS BUT THE LONG END PARTICULAR WE REMAINED

09:12 CAUTIOUS. THE OVER OPTIMISM ABOUT WHEN

09:14 THE FED IS GOING TO CUT AND HOW THE OTHER PART OF THAT IS

09:19 SUPPLY. WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

09:21 SUPPLY WITH SOME OF THE ACTORS BACK IN RANGE.

09:26 SO STILL A BIT UNDERWEIGHT BONDS, MOST OF THEM UNDERWEIGHT.

09:28 CONCENTRATED ON THE LONG END OF THE TREASURY.

09:32 >> WHEN DO YOU START GETTING INTERESTED. GOING FOR 5% AGAIN?

09:42 >> I DON'T THINK -- 450 IS DEPENDING ON THE CONTEXT.

09:45 PRETTY HOT ON INFLATION. THAT NUMBER GOES UP.

09:50 IT'S A ROUGH ESTIMATE. I THINK YOU GOT TO 450 AND GETS

09:52 A BIT MORE INTERESTING. WE DO THINK INFLATION IS

09:55 HEADING DOWN. WE THINK YOU WILL SEE CORE

10:01 INFLATION IN THE 2.5% RANGE BY THE END OF THE YEAR.

10:05 IF THE MARKET GIVES YOU AN OPPORTUNITY I THINK IT BECOMES

10:07 A BIT MORE INTERESTING RELATIVE TO WHERE WE WERE A COUPLE OF

10:08 MONTHS AGO. LISA:

10:15 ARE YOU THE KIND OF PERSON THAT SAYS SELL OFF, THIS IS A DIP,

10:19 OR ARE YOU THE PERSON WHO SAYS WE HAVE ALLOCATIONS TO STAY

10:23 STEADY AND SEE HOW THINGS GO.

10:27 >> PARTICULARLY IN THE LATE AFTERNOON THAT'S PRETTY

10:29 DRAMATIC SELLOFF. THERE WERE PARTS OF THE MARKET

10:34 YOU MAY WANT TO GO BACK AND TAKE A LOOK AT.

10:37 I DO THINK THAT THE NARRATIVE DID NOT CHANGE YESTERDAY.

10:42 IT REMINDED US THE PATH OF THAT INFLATION IS GOING TO BE BUMPY.

10:46 WE STILL BELIEVE THE ECONOMY IS IN GOOD SHAPE.

10:50 I THINK THE SHORT ANSWER IS YOU MOSTLY STICK TO YOUR PLAN.

10:54 >> LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT WITH REGARDS TO EQUITIES AND

10:55 FINISHING OVERWEIGHT IN EQUITIES. IS THE U.S.

10:58 STILL THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN? RUSS:

11:04 WE ALL ALSO BEEN OVERWEIGHT AND JAPANESE EQUITIES WHICH WOULD

11:05 BE INTERESTING FOR THE FIRST TIME.

11:12 I DO THINK THE U.S. IS THE BEST GAME IN TOWN AND

11:13 THERE'S A COUPLE OF REASONS FOR THAT. THE U.S.

11:16 IS STILL THE MOST RESILIENT ECONOMY. WE ARE SEEING THAT WITH

11:19 ECONOMIC DATA GENERALLY COMING IN STRONG.

11:22 BEYOND THAT YOU STILL HAVE THE QUALITY, CONSISTENCY AND

11:26 PROFITABILITY. WE LOOK AROUND THE WORLD AT

11:29 COMPANIES THAT HAVE THOSE CHARACTERISTICS.

11:31 WE STILL FIND MORE OF THEM IN THE UNITED STATES AND TECH AND

11:34 HEALTH CARE, CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY. JONATHAN:

11:36 GOOD TO CATCH UP. UNDERWEIGHT BONDS, OVERWEIGHT

11:39 EQUITIES.

11:45 THE MOVE IN DOLLAR-YEN YESTERDAY, THAT'S A ONE

11:48 PERCENTAGE POINT MOVE AGAINST THE JAPANESE YEN.

11:50 >> THE RESPONSE FROM THE AUTHORITIES. LISA:

11:54 SOME OF THE RECENT RAPID MOVES ARE IN LINE WITH FUNDAMENTALS

11:57 BUT SOME ARE CLEARLY SPECULATIVE.

11:59 I THINK THE LATTER ARE DESIRABLE.

12:03 THAT'S THE FINANCE MINISTER FOR INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS FOR JAPAN

12:04 AND THEIR SPONSOR MARKETS. WHAT YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT.

12:11 LISA: PEOPLE DON'T THINK THERE WILL

12:13 BE ACTION ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. JONATHAN: STILL NORTH OF 150.

12:19 LET'S GET YOU UP TO DATE ON STORIES BUT HERE'S YOUR

12:26 BLOOMBERG BRIEF. DANI:

12:27 DEFENSE SECRETARY LLOYD AUSTIN HAS BEEN RELEASED FROM THE

12:30 HOSPITAL AFTER UNDERGOING A PROCEDURE.

12:33 THE PENTAGON SAYS HE WILL WORK FROM HOME UNTIL LATER THIS WEEK.

12:36 HE HAD CANCELED A TRIP TO BRUSSELS TO BE WITH OTHER

12:40 DEFENSE CHIEFS AND WILL JOIN VIRTUALLY THIS MORNING.

12:43 AUSTIN WAS HOSPITALIZED FOLLOWING COMPLICATIONS FROM

12:44 PROSTATE CANCER TREATMENT. IT SPARKED FEAR AFTER HE WAITED

12:48 DAYS TO INFORM THE PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS.

12:52 UNICREDIT POISED TO INCREASE ITS BONUS BY 16%.

12:57 THEY POSTED RECORD PROFIT AND INCREASED SHAREHOLDER RETURNS.

13:01 THE AVERAGE GAIN WILL BE HIGHER BECAUSE OF JOB CUTS.

13:05 THE INCREASES WILL BE BETWEEN 9% AND 20% ACCORDING TO SOURCES.

13:11 IT BUCKS THE TREND OF OTHER BANKS PLANNING TO REDUCE POOLS

13:13 AFTER A CHALLENGING YEAR.

13:15 DEMOCRATIC TOM SWAZI WINNING THE RACE TO SUCCEED OUSTED NEW

13:21 YORK REPRESENTATIVE GEORGE SANTOS.

13:23 HE DEFEATED THE REPUBLICAN CHALLENGER, TAKING 54% OF THE

13:24 VOTE. VICTORY FLIPS THE SEATBACK TO

13:31 DEMOCRATS AND NARROWS THE GOP RAZOR THIN MAJORITY IN THE

13:33 HOUSE TO JUST SIX SEATS. THAT'S YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF.

13:39 JONATHAN: LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS JUST

13:41 BRIEFLY PRAYED WAS THIS A REFERENDUM ON THE SITTING

13:46 PRESIDENT?

13:47 >> THIS IS A DISTRICT OR IMMIGRATION BECAME ONE OF THE

13:48 TOP ISSUES PEOPLE WERE GOING OUT TO VOTE FOR.

13:51 I COME FROM JUST OUTSIDE THIS DISTRICT AND I CAN TELL YOU

13:54 IT'S A LONG FAR CRY FROM THE SOUTHERN BORDER.

13:57 WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT LOOKING AT NOVEMBER.

14:00 IMMIGRATION WEIGHING ON LONG ISLAND VOTERS IT WILL BE A BIG

14:01 ISSUE FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN. HE TOOK IT TO BIDEN SAYING

14:06 THERE WERE MOMENTS IN CONGRESS WHEN I SERVED THAT I WENT

14:10 AGAINST MY PARTY SAYING HE THINGS THE BORDER SHOULD BE

14:15 SHUT DOWN.

14:16 POTENTIALLY IT'S WHAT YOU WILL SEE SOME DEMOCRATS IN HOME

14:19 DISTRICTS ACTUALLY MAYBE PUT SOME BLAME ON BIDEN FOR THE

14:24 BORDER. JONATHAN: INTERESTING.

14:25 UP NEXT ON THIS PROGRAM, AID FOR ISRAEL AND UKRAINE FORCING

14:27 A STANDOFF IN THE HOUSE.

14:30 >> I URGE SPEAKER JOHNSON TO BRING IT TO THE FLOOR

14:31 IMMEDIATELY.

14:37 THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE SENATE BILL WAS PUT ON THE

14:39 FLOOR IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IT WOULD PASS.

14:42 JONATHAN: THAT CONVERSATION COMING UP

14:43 NEXT. GOOD MORNING. THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

14:49 ♪

15:08 JONATHAN: BOUNCING BACK A TOUCH ON THE

15:12 S&P 500 DOWN YESTERDAY BY ALMOST 1.4% AT THE CLOSE.

15:15 ERASING SOME OF THOSE LOSSES TOWARDS THE END OF THE DAY.

15:18 FUTURES ARE POSITIVE BY ONE THIRD OF 1%. 428 68.

15:24 UNDER SURVEILLANCE THIS MORNING, AID FOR ISRAEL AND

15:26 UKRAINE FORCING A STANDOFF IN THE HOUSE.

15:30 >> I URGE SPEAKER JOHNSON TO BRING IT TO THE FLOOR

15:32 IMMEDIATELY, IMMEDIATELY.

15:38 THERE'S NO QUESTION THE SENATE BILL WAS PUT ON THE FLOOR IN

15:39 THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IT WOULD PASS. IT WOULD PASS.

15:45 SO I CALL ON THE SPEAKER TO LET THE FULL HOUSE SPEAK ITS MIND

15:48 AND NOT ALLOW A MINORITY OF THE MOST EXTREME AND VOICES IN THE

15:51 HOUSE TO BLOCK THIS BILL EVEN FROM BEING VOTED ON.

15:55 THIS IS A CRITICAL ACT FOR THE HOUSE TO MOVE. JONATHAN:

15:59 THE WHITE HOUSE URGING SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON TO BRING A 96

16:02 BILLION DOLLAR FOREIGN AID PACKAGE TO THE FLOOR.

16:05 THE BILL FACING A TOUGH AUDIENCE IN THE REPUBLICAN-LED

16:07 HOUSE WERE BORDER SECURITY REMAINS A PRIORITY.

16:11 JOHNSON WRITING HOUSE OR REPUBLICANS WERE CRYSTAL CLEAR

16:12 FROM THE BEGINNING. ANY SO-CALLED NATIONAL SECURITY

16:17 SUPPLEMENTAL LEGISLATION MUST RECOGNIZE THE SECURITY BEGINS

16:20 AT OUR OWN BORDER BUT JOHN, WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS

16:23 NOW FOR WEEKS. THOU SKIP PAST ONE BILL, THE

16:24 SENATE COULD PASS ANOTHER. WILL THEY PASS THE SAME BILL

16:28 ANYTIME SOON?

16:30 >> EVENTUALLY THEY WILL HAVE TO. THAT MAY NOT INCLUDE ANYTHING

16:33 THEY ARE WORKING ON. THEY HAVE TO DO THIS GOVERNMENT

16:37 SHUTDOWN BILL ON MARCH 8 AND IF THEY DON'T THEY WILL HAVE A

16:41 BIGGER PROBLEM ON THEIR HAND THAT EITHER THE TAX BILL OR THE

16:43 UKRAINIAN BILL THEY HAVE ALREADY PASSED.

16:47 THAT DEADLINE IS A KEY ONE WE ARE WATCHING TO SEE WHAT CAN

16:49 GET DONE. I WOULD ANTICIPATE THE HOUSE

16:53 WILL ATTEMPT TO ADD TO THEIR TAX BILL TO THE APPROPRIATIONS

16:54 BILL THAT HAS TO GET DONE. BUT THE UKRAINE AID THE HOUSE

17:00 HAS NO INTENTION OF DOING ANYTHING ON.

17:02 IT SEEMS TO BE OPERATING ON A DIFFERENT TIMELINE WHICH MEANS

17:05 WE COULD BE IN THE MIDDLE OF MARCH STILL TALKING ABOUT THIS

17:10 ISSUE.

17:11 >> COULD THE FOREIGN AID BE ATTACHED TO THE SPENDING BILLS

17:14 QUESTION MARK >> IT COULD -- SPENDING BILLS?

17:17 >> IT'S A BIT OF A CHICKEN AND THE EGG.

17:21 IT'S UNLIKELY THEY WILL BE THE ONES WITH ATTACHED THE

17:23 UKRAINIAN AID MEANS THE BILL WOULD GO TO THE SENATE, WE KNOW

17:28 THEY HAVE THE VOTES TO ATTACH IT TO THE APPROPRIATIONS BILL

17:31 AND SEND IT BACK OVER BUT THEN YOU ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE

17:33 DEMOCRATS AND UKRAINE SUPPORTERS ARE RISKING A

17:35 GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN BY TRYING TO JAM THE HOUSE OF THE LAST

17:37 MINUTE. SO FAR THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE

17:39 TO DO THAT.

17:45 ANNMARIE: YESTERDAY HAKEEM JEFFRIES SAYS

17:46 THERE'S 300 BIPARTISAN VOTES FOR THE PACKAGE PRAYED I KNOW

17:51 IT'S EARLY IN THE MORNING TO THINK THIS COULD HAPPEN BUT

17:54 COULD WE SEE A DISCHARGE POSITION -- PETITION ON THE

17:57 HOUSE FLOOR?

18:01 >> I THINK IT'S A HIGH DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY TO GET DONE.

18:02 YOU HAVE TIMING ISSUES.

18:08 YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE UNANIMOUS DEMOCRATIC

18:10 SUPPORT WHICH YOU MAY NOT GET IF THERE IS AID TO ISRAEL

18:13 ATTACHED TO THE BILL AND YOU HAVE TO FIND ENOUGH REPUBLICANS

18:17 WILLING TO BUCK SPEAKER JOHNSON WHO RIGHT NOW LOOKS VERY WEAK

18:18 IN ORDER TO GET THIS DONE. THIS IS A VERY NARROW PATH AND

18:24 IT'S REALLY INCLUDED. RIGHT NOW THAT'S NOT MY

18:27 EXPECTATION. IT'S MUCH MORE LIKELY PATH.

18:35 JOHNSON YESTERDAY WAS TALKING ABOUT THE HOUSE WORKING IT'S

18:39 WILL WHICH IS NORMALLY CODE FOR PUTTING SOMETHING ON THE FLOOR

18:40 AND THEN TRYING TO AMEND IT. WE ARE NOT SURE WHAT HE'S

18:42 THINKING YET. LISA: I WAS WONDERING WHY SENATE

18:46 REPUBLICANS WOULD PUT THEMSELVES ON THE LINE IF THEY

18:49 KNEW IT WAS DEAD IN THE WATER INTO THE HOUSE.

18:53 IT WOULD GO AGAINST CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THEIR BASE.

18:57 DO YOU HAVE AN EXPLANATION?

18:59 >> I THINK THE TACT IS LIVE TO FIGHT ANOTHER DAY.

19:01 MUSCLE THIS INTO THE SENATE, DEMONSTRATORS BIPARTISAN

19:05 SUPPORT , TO LEADER MCCONNELL'S CREDIT THE VOTE DID GROW IN YOU

19:07 A 22 REPUBLICANS IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE IN THE SENATE WHICH

19:12 IS A SIGNAL REPUBLICANS -- ENOUGH REPUBLICANS SUPPORTED TO

19:13 PASS IN THE HOUSE. NOW THE BALL IS IN JOHNSON'S

19:17 COURT AND THAT'S OUT OF THE SENATE'S CONTROL.

19:20 >> WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO SEE WHAT WE CAN GET OUT OF THIS

19:24 POLITICAL DYSFUNCTION THAT FEELS LIKE IT'S REACHED A NEW

19:29 LEVEL.

19:30 TOM SUOZZI WINNING THAT ELECTION TAKING OVER FOR

19:33 REPUBLICAN GEORGE SANTOS. THIS IS WHAT HE WAS SAYING, THE

19:36 PEOPLE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF POLITICAL BICKERING, THEY WANT

19:37 US TO COME TOGETHER AND SOLVE A PROBLEM.

19:41 IS THAT A WAY PEOPLE CAN WIN A REPRESENTATIVE >> OF LONG

19:47 ISLAND DITCHING GEORGE SANTOS. IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO SAY

19:52 THEY WANT PROBLEM SOLVERS. THERE'S EVEN A PROBLEM SOLVER

19:54 CAUCUS. IT DOESN'T -- WE DO ANYTHING TO

19:57 BREAK THROUGH THE POLITICAL GRIDLOCK THE U.S. FACES.

20:00 YOUR NOMINATING AN EXTREME CANDIDATE ON THE REPUBLICAN

20:04 SIDE IN YOUR OLD CANDIDATE ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, NEITHER OF

20:07 WHOM SEEM REALLY INTERESTED IN REACHING ACROSS THE ISLE AND

20:09 SOLVING PROBLEMS NOW. I THINK IT'S TELLING WHEN YOU

20:13 LOOK AT THE STATE OF THE UNION YOU HAVE DEMOCRATS AND

20:17 PRESIDENT TRUMP GOING OUT OF THE FLOOR TO TAKE A PICTURE

20:18 WITH HIM. THE APPEARANCE SEEMS TO BE MORE

20:21 IMPORTANT THAN ACTUALLY COMING TOGETHER IN SOLVING PROBLEMS

20:24 AND AGREEING ON POLICY SOLUTIONS IN WASHINGTON.

20:28 >>, WE TALK ABOUT PRESIDENT BIDEN A LITTLE BIT AS WELL.

20:32 THE REPORTS HE CALLED THE ISRAELI LEADER AN A WHOLE ON

20:36 SEVERAL OCCASIONS. SUMMARIZING A MEETING THAT TOOK

20:40 PLACE 12 MONTHS AGO ABOUT HOW ANGRY THE PRESIDENT WAS WITH

20:42 HIS TEAM OVER THE BORDER. THIS FEELS STRATEGIC.

20:50 I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT IS, IS ANGRY BARDEN -- ANGRY BIDEN

20:52 PART OF THE CAMPAIGN NOW?

20:55 >> HE'S GOT TO LOOK LIKE HE'S OUT OF TOUCH, YOU HAVE A LOT OF

21:01 VOTERS THAT ARE ANGRY THAT CONTINUE TO HAVE PRICES, OF THE

21:03 SITUATION ON THE BORDER AND THE CHAOS GLOBALLY.

21:05 I COMPLETELY AGREE THESE ARE STRATEGIC LEAKS.

21:09 THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS MOVING TO SHORE UP ITS LEFT

21:11 FLANK EVERYWHERE IT CAN. IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THEY

21:16 PUT CONDITIONS ON AID TO ISRAEL FOR THE VOTE IN THE SENATE.

21:18 THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE KNOW THEY GET THE MESSAGE THAT

21:23 THEIR STANCE ON ISRAEL HAS NOT BEEN POPULAR WITH THEIR BASE

21:25 AND THEY KNOW IMMIGRATION IS THE BIGGEST VULNERABILITY FOR

21:27 THEM IN THEIR REELECTIONS. THEY HAVE TO START DOING MORE

21:31 ON THIS TOPIC THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE CAMPAIGN.

21:34 >> I WAS STRUCK BY HOW MUCH IMMIGRATION PLAYED A ROLE WITH

21:36 THE AD SPENDING AND HOW MUCH THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT IN THE

21:38 DISTRICT ON LONG ISLAND. IF IMMIGRATION IS BIDEN'S

21:44 NUMBER ONE CONCERN RIGHT NOW AND HE'S TRYING TO SHORE UP

21:47 INDEPENDENCE INTO NOVEMBER, WHAT CAN HE DO IN TERMS OF

21:52 EXECUTIVE ACTION TO LOOK LIKE HE IS AT LEAST ACTING TOUGH ON

21:57 THE BORDER?

21:58 >> HE'S GOT THE SAME PROBLEM HE HAS WHERE HE COULD DO SOMETHING

22:01 BUT HE WILL START TO LOSE THE LEFT FLANK BECAUSE THEY THINK A

22:03 LOT OF THE ACTIONS THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK WERE

22:05 INHUMANE. THINGS LIKE TITLE 42 WHICH

22:11 ALLOWED TRUMP TO EXPEL ASYLUM-SEEKERS BACK TO MEXICO

22:13 IMMEDIATELY, OF THESE THINGS ARE JUST NOT REALLY ON THE

22:14 TABLE FOR THEM. REPUBLICANS HANDED BIDEN A BIT

22:20 OF A GIFT LAST WEEK WHEN THEY DENIED THE BORDER BILL THAT

22:23 BIDEN WAS WILLING TO SIGN BECAUSE NOW HE CAN SAY I TRIED

22:27 TO GET SOMETHING DONE AND REPUBLICANS REFUSED.

22:30 YOU WILL SEE HIM START TO PUT MORE RESOURCES DOWN TO DO MORE

22:37 TO EXPORT PEOPLE AND GET MORE CLEAR MESSAGES TO MIGRANTS OVER

22:38 THE SOUTHERN BORDER.

22:44 BUT HE IS LIMITED IN THE TOOLS NOT BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE THE

22:47 ACTUAL PROCESSES BUT BY THE POLITICS OF IT. JONATHAN:

22:49 APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THAT READ

22:56 FROM AXIOS YESTERDAY ABOUT THE MEETING IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS

22:58 THAT EVERYONE KNOWS THE PRESIDENT WAS FURIOUS WITH HIS

23:00 TEAM AND DID NOT CHANGE ANY PERSONNEL. LISA:

23:05 FURIOUS -- ANNMARIE: FURIOUS WITH THE FACTOR SEEMS

23:07 TO BE NO ONE IN THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO

23:09 ACTUALLY OWN THE BORDER. IT SEEMS SOME PEOPLE ARE COMING

23:12 IN AND OUT OF TRYING TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM BUT TO YOUR POINT,

23:20 WE DO SEE THE CAMPAIGN LEAN ON THOSE LASERBEAM EYES AND I

23:23 NEVER THOUGHT OF THIS IDEA OF ANGRY BIDEN. JONATHAN:

23:26 IT SEEMS TO BE STRATEGIC. DON'T YOU SEE THE SAME THING.

23:31 LISA: HOW DO YOU EXPRESS YOUR DISLIKE

23:32 OF SOMETHING WITHOUT CHANGING POLICY?

23:37 HOW DO YOU END UP TRYING TO SEEM FIRED UP AND READY TO GO

23:39 WITHOUT CHANGING PERSONNEL. YOU TRY TO SHIFT YOUR STANCE AT

23:42 SOME LEVEL. THIS RAISES THE QUESTION OF

23:46 WHERE SOME OF THE COMMUNICATIONS PEOPLE ARE PAID

23:51 THE INSTAGRAM POST. ANNMARIE: EVEN WORSE IT WASN'T INSTAGRAM

23:56 IT WAS TIKTOK. WHICH IS UNDER SIFY'S REVIEW

24:01 AND YOUR MEMBERS OF HIS OWN PARTY IN CONGRESS SAYING I'M

24:04 NOT UNTIL THE PRESIDENT HOW TO CAMPAIGN BUT THAT DOES UNNERVE

24:12 ME. JONATHAN: I JUST CAN'T.

24:16 PEOPLE WERE UPSET WITH JON STEWART BUT I THOUGHT HE

24:18 ACTUALLY MAKES FUN OF BOTH SIDES THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE

24:20 CAMPAIGN. I HOPE THIS IS WHAT HE DOES

24:21 EVERY YEAR. LISA: IT'S NOT JUST THE DAY OF THE

24:26 ELECTION, IT'S THE DAY AFTER. EQUITY FUTURES ON THE S&P.

24:30 WHAT A DIFFERENCE IN EXTRAS ZERO MAKES.

24:51 JONATHAN: BOUNCING BACK FROM THE BIGGEST

24:53 ONE-DAY LOSS AT ABOUT TWO WEEKS, ECKLEY FUTURES POSITIVE

24:56 BY 0.4%.

24:57 INFLATION PRINT ENOUGH ON WALL STREET, THE BEARS HAVE RETURNED

25:00 AND GOLDILOCKS WAS STILL THERE.

25:02 >> I ALSO LIKE GOLDILOCKS AND THE FIRST GOT PUNCH.

25:09 IT'S BASICALLY THE REALITY CHECK TO THE FAIRYTALE YOU

25:10 THINK YOU ARE LIVING IN.

25:13 >> LET'S TURN TO THE BOND MARKET.

25:17 WE HAD A DOUBLE-DIGIT MOVE ACROSS THE CURVE ABOUT TWO-YEAR

25:21 OUT TO 10. LOW OR BY A COUPLE OF BASIS

25:28 POINTS.

25:29 ON THE TWO-YEAR, WE ARE BACK IN THE 4.60S. LISA:

25:34 IT WASN'T JUST SORT OF LIP SERVICE OR MARKET MOVE YOU SEE

25:37 A LOT OF STRATEGISTS COMING OUT AND REDUCING SOME OF THE RATE

25:38 CUT EXPECTATIONS. THIS IS BAD ON EVERY LEVEL.

25:43 THE SUPER COURT METRICS EVERYONE LOVES ROSE THE MOST

25:49 GOING BACK, ALMOST TWO YEARS PRAYED THIS IS NOT WHAT THEY

25:50 WANT TO SEE WHEN THEY'RE HOPING FOR A BROADENING OUT OF

25:52 DISINFLATION. JONATHAN: JONATHAN:

25:55 WE WILL TALK TO SARAH WOLF IN A MOMENT.

26:00 CPI WITH PCE AND WAITING FOR SHOUTS OF ONE BUT NOT THE OTHER.

26:04 YOU AND I SAID RIGHT AFTER THE NUMBER CAME OUT THAT MAYBE THE

26:09 CHANGES FOR THE MARKET THAN FED OFFICIALS EVEN THE GUIDANCE

26:12 THEY'VE GIVEN US OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS.

26:14 >> NOTHING REALLY CHANGES PRAY THEY BEEN TALKING ABOUT FREE

26:15 RATE CUTS. THE MARKET WAS TALKING FIVE OR

26:17 SIX. I WAS LOOKING AT BNP FOR EXAMPLE HE CHANGED HIS

26:24 RECOMMENDATION OR EXPECTATIONS PUSHING IT BACK HAVING FEWER

26:27 RATE CUTS SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE BROADENING OUT OF INFLATION

26:31 PRESSURES. PCE WILL BE MORE IMPORTANT.

26:33 THIS DOES NOT MAKE THEM CONFIDENT. JONATHAN:

26:37 A WHOLE LOT STRONGER OFF THE BACK OF THE BOND MOVE.

26:41 THE EURO, THIS IS FROM THE ECB THIS MORNING.

26:44 ROSES ARE RED, VIOLETS ARE BLUE. DID YOU SEE THAT?

26:48 THIS IS WHAT THEY TWEETED. I'M DOCKETING USE HIS LANGUAGE

26:52 I WILL ADJUST SOME OF HIS LANGUAGE.

26:57 WE MESSED UP THE LAST CYCLE AND WE WILL THIS CYCLE TOO.

27:00 THAT'S THE COMEBACK BACK TO THE ECB THIS MORNING GRADE LISA:

27:07 HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY TO EVERYONE, I AM CURIOUS HOW THEY

27:09 PLAN TO MESSAGE THIS GIVEN THEY ARE SEEING MORE WEAKNESS.

27:13 WE ALSO ARE FROM THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE ECB SAYING WE

27:16 ARE NOT READY TO START CUTTING RATES. PEOPLE ARE LIKE WHATEVER.

27:20 GOOD LUCK WITH THAT. JONATHAN: FED OFFICIALS, BOJ OFFICIALS

27:25 HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY. DOLLAR-YEN 150.64.

27:30 THERE'S ALWAYS A FEELING IN MARKETS.

27:33 SOMETIMES THERE'S SOMETHING TO IT AND OTHER TIMES THERE IS

27:37 INTEGRATED THIS FEELS ALIGNED IN THE SAND FOR OFFICIALS. LISA:

27:40 IS IT THE LINE IN THE SAND FOR THEM TO SAY WE WILL DO

27:44 SOMETHING ABOUT IT. IT SEEMS LIKE THEY WILL COME

27:47 OUT AND SAY IT. EVERYONE'S LIKE WE'VE HEARD

27:51 THIS BEFORE AND THEY KEEP ON SELLING.

27:54 WHEN DO THEY ACTUALLY PULLED THE TRIGGER ON SOMETHING MORE

27:58 MEANINGFUL AND WHEN DO THEY RAISE RATES FOR STOCKS TO MOVE

28:01 THE BOND BUYING OR DO SOME OF THE FINANCIAL IMPRESSIONS PART

28:04 JONATHAN: THEY NEED TO BE CREDIBLE AND IF

28:06 YOU KEEP SAYING IT AT SOME POINT YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING.

28:11 THAT CONVERSATION HAS TO GROW IN THE WEEKS OR MONTHS TO COME.

28:13 LISA: THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE SEEING NOW

28:14 IN THE MARKET. JONATHAN: ONTO SURVEILLANCE THIS MORNING,

28:20 FED SPEAK ON DECK AFTER THE INFLATION DATA.

28:25 VICE CHAIR FOR SUPERVISION BOTH SPEAKING WITH MORE DATA DUE OUT

28:26 LATER THIS WEEK. PPI AND CONSUMER SENTIMENT ON

28:31 FRIDAY. FOMC MEETING MINUTES, OUT ONE

28:33 WEEK FROM TODAY.

28:39 IF RETAIL SALES HOLD UP, IF THAT'S LOOKING HOT, YOU GO BACK

28:44 TO THAT CONVERSATION YOU START TO TIP THE SCALES BACK TOWARDS

28:46 OVERHEATING AND AWAY FROM SOFT LANDING. LISA:

28:52 RUSS SAID THIS IS NOT SHIFT THE NARRATIVE FOR HIM.

28:55 I WONDER HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE SAYING I'M STARTING TO LOOK

28:58 ELSEWHERE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT COCA-COLA

29:00 RAISING PRICES, WHEN YOU LOOK AT ELSEWHERE AND SOME OF THESE

29:05 PRICE PRESSURES, YOU HAVE TO WONDER WHY PEOPLE ARE ACCEPTING

29:06 THAT AND CONTINUING TO BUY. THAT'S WERE RETAIL SPENDING

29:11 COMES INTO PLAY AND IT'S A QUESTION OF THIS IS A SUDDEN

29:13 REPRICING IN JANUARY.

29:16 >> ALREADY UNDERWEIGHT BONDS AND OVERWEIGHT STOCKS.

29:19 THAT'S WIDE FEELS GOOD. LET'S TURN TO THE POLITICS PRAY

29:23 DEMOCRATS PICKING UP A SEAT IN THE HOUSE.

29:28 DEMOCRAT TOM SWAZI TO FILL THE SPOT LEFT BACON -- VACANT.

29:35 BEATING THE REPUBLICAN OPPONENT 53.9 PERCENT TO 46.1% AND 93%

29:38 OF THE VOTE COUNTED SO FAR.

29:44 THE RACE IS A NATIONAL ASH THE GOP CURRENTLY HOLDING AT -- A

29:47 MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE. THAT MARGIN GETS SLIMMER.

29:54 >> IF YOU LOOK AT THE VOTE TAKEN PLACE JUST BEFORE THE

29:58 POLLS CLOSE IN NEW YORK IT WAS THE IMPEACHMENT OF SEC.

30:02 MAYORKAS WINNING BY THE SLIMMEST MAJORITY, AND REMEMBER

30:04 IT WAS DEJA VU BECAUSE THEY TRIED TO IMPEACH MAYORKAS AND

30:09 DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH VOTES. STEVE SCALISE WHO IS UNDERGOING

30:12 BLOOD TREATMENT FOR CANCER CAME BACK TO TAKE THAT VOTE.

30:15 THIS IS WHAT YOU WILL START TO SEE WHEN YOU GET SOME OF THESE

30:16 PARTISAN BILLS. EVERYONE HAS TO BE THERE AND

30:18 SHOW UP. THE MAJORITY THEY HAVE IS SO

30:20 SLIM.

30:21 >> WHAT WAS THE STRATEGY YOU THINK COULD CARRY OVER TO THE

30:29 NATIONAL.

30:30 >> WE CAN'T FORGET TOM IS A KNOWN NAME IN THIS DISTRICT AND

30:33 MAS HE BRAND-NEW TO THE SCENE. AND SOME SAID LET'S GO BACK TO

30:37 WHAT WE KNEW. SANTOS WAS A BIT OF CHAOS IN

30:45 THAT DISTRICT TO SAY THE LEAST. WHEN IT COMES TO THE NATIONAL

30:47 STAGE INSTEAD OF BACKING AWAY FROM IMMIGRATION AND THE FACT

30:52 WHAT WE SEE IN OUR POLLING IS MOST VOTERS PLAY THE BLAME AT

30:53 PRESIDENT BIDEN FOR THIS HE TOOK IT ON SAYING I THINK WE

30:58 NEED TO SHUT THE BORDER, MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE AND THERE'S

31:01 INSTANCES WHERE I BUCKED THE TREND OF MY PARTY.

31:05 >> A LOT MORE OF THAT IN THE MONTHS TO COME GOING INTO THE

31:10 GENERAL. LET'S FINISH ON THIS STORY.

31:13 LYFT PULLING BACK WITH A RUN-UP OF SMUDGES 67% AFTER REPORTING

31:15 AN ERROR IN ITS OUTLOOK. THE RIDESHARING COMPANY SAID

31:20 MARGINS WOULD EXPAND BY 500 BASIS POINTS BEFORE CORRECTING

31:23 THE FIGURE ON THE CALL TO 50. THE COMPANY SAID THE MISTAKE

31:28 WAS A CLERICAL ERROR. EARNINGS COMING IN AHEAD OF

31:32 EXPECTATIONS AS IT LOOKS TO COMPETE WITH UBER.

31:36 ALEX WEBB LISTEN TO THE CALL AND SCRATCHED HIS HEAD AS WELL.

31:40 HOW ON EARTH DOES THAT HAPPEN?

31:46 >> A LOT OF FAT FINGERS WHEN IT COMES TO TRADE.

31:48 THIS MIGHT BE ONE OF THE PHYSICAL KEYBOARD.

31:51 THIS KIND OF MIND BLOWING THAT SUCH A THING WOULD HAPPEN,

31:55 SPEAKING TO FINANCE DEPARTMENTS, THE DETAIL, THE

32:00 LABORIOUS AND THIS WITH WHICH THEY GO THROUGH THEIR EARNINGS

32:03 STATEMENTS TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NOTHING AWRY AND YET SOMEHOW IT

32:07 SEEMS THIS MISTAKE WHICH LOOKS LIKE A CASE OF HUMAN ERROR

32:09 SOMEHOW SNUCK THROUGH. THE LINE FROM THE LAWYER IN THE

32:17 STORY WHO SAYS THIS DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT'S MARKETS FRAUD,

32:20 IT LOOKS LIKE A HUMAN MISTAKE. IT DOESN'T LOOK -- MAKE THEM

32:24 LOOK VERY GOOD.

32:27 >> POTENTIAL LEGAL CONSEQUENCES OF THIS? ALEX: I AM NO LAWYER.

32:35 I AM NOT SURPRISED OF THEIR PEOPLE WHO PERHAPS DO RAISE

32:39 SOME SORT OF LEGAL TROUBLE TAKING THEM TO COURT ON THE

32:40 BASIS OF THIS. THE MIGHT OF LOST MONEY IN THAT

32:44 SHORT WINDOW WHERE THEY HAVE INSTATED THE CORRECT NUMBERS.

32:48 BUT IT'S HARD TO KNOW HOW THIS SOUNDS.

32:54 I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF SOMEBODY COMES UP IT'S HARD TO

32:56 PREDICT HOW THAT PLAYS OUT.

33:00 >> IT'S ONE THING TO HAVE A FAT FINGER ON A TWITTER POST, THE

33:04 RELEASE OF YOUR FINANCIAL RESULTS TYPICALLY THOSE ARE

33:06 PROOFREAD, THERE'S MORE THAN ONE PERSON TO LOOK OVER THIS.

33:10 WHAT IS THAT SAY ABOUT HOW THIS COMPANY IS MANAGED?

33:15 DOES THIS RAISE QUESTIONS FOR INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS ABOUT

33:20 WHAT'S GOING ON?

33:22 >> THAT IS THE RISK, BUT NOT IN ISOLATION.

33:24 IF YOU HAVE A FEW INSTANCES OF

33:30 A SEEMING LACK OF ATTENTION TO DETAIL, A FEW FLUBS IN THE WAY

33:32 THE COMPANY IS RUN IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THAT IS HAPPENING.

33:36 THERE IS RELATIVELY NEW LEADERSHIP TEAM AT LYFT.

33:43 ONE REASON WHY THE REACTION WAS SO OUTSIZED INITIALLY IS THIS

33:47 IS A BIG YEAR FOR LYFT. IT COULD BE THE FIRST YEAR THEY

33:52 POST A PROFIT ON AN OPERATING BASIS IF NOT QUITE ON A NET

33:56 BASIS. SO THE FACT IT LOOKED AS THOUGH

33:58 THEY MIGHT MASSIVELY OUTPERFORM EXPECTATIONS WAS HUGE.

34:04 THEY HAVE COLOSSAL COMPETITION WITH UBER.

34:05 THEY HAVE DIFFERENT REVENUE STREAMS. IT'S VERY MUCH 500

34:11 POUND GORILLA IN THE ROOM WHEREAS LYFT YOU CAN SAY IS

34:16 MORE AGILE BUT IT STRUGGLES TO COME PETE FINANCIALLY WITH UBER.

34:19 THAT'S WHY ATTENTION TO DETAIL IS SUPER IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT'S

34:22 WORKING ON WAYFINDER MARGINS THAN UBER DOES.

34:28 AT THE MOMENT THERE'S MORE THAN THIS BUT IT PUTS MANAGEMENT

34:30 UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE TO ENSURE THIS OCCURS. LISA:

34:34 ANY IDEA OF A CLERICAL ERROR MIX ME SOMEONE THINK OF A BACK

34:38 ROOM TRYING TO FILE THEM. JUST MOVING ON THERE IS A POINT

34:43 OF THE EARNINGS WERE STRONG, THAT THEY DID SHOW GROWTH IN

34:48 EARNINGS. PEOPLE USING RIDESHARE SERVICES

34:50 AT A SIGNIFICANT CLIP. IS THIS A BROADER STATEMENT ON

34:54 CONSUMER APPETITE, CONSUMER ABILITY TO KEEP SPENDING.

34:58 IT'S ALSO UBER, IT'S NOT A MARKET SHARE THING.

34:59 IT'S AN ALL IN SPENDING THING.

35:03 >> IT'S INTERESTING THEY ATTRIBUTED SOME OF THE GAINS TO

35:06 BIG TOURING EVENTS. THE FACT PEOPLE ARE GOING OUT

35:08 TO LIVE ENTERTAINMENT. THERE WAS SOME QUESTIONING

35:14 WHETHER THAT BOOM THAT WE SAW IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE COVID

35:16 PANDEMIC WAS STARTING TO TAPER A LITTLE BIT.

35:21 ACCORDING TO THE STATEMENTS YESTERDAY IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE

35:22 THAT'S HAPPENING. THEY ARE REALLY GETTING THAT

35:25 TAILWIND OF PEOPLE GOING OUT TRYING TO ENJOY THIS WHICH IS

35:30 GOOD NEWS ACROSS THE BOARD WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT ANY INDUSTRY

35:31 THAT'S DEPENDENT ON CONSUMER SENTIMENT.

35:36 SO THEY ARE CLEARLY BENEFITING FROM THAT.

35:38 AT THE SAME TIME THE FACT THAT A FEW BIG LIVE TOURING EVENTS

35:43 COULD AFFECT THEIR EARNINGS TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY ARE

35:45 WILLING TO TALK ABOUT IT SHOWS THAT MAYBE THEY ARE DEPENDENT

35:50 ON A FEW SMALL WINS IN EITHER DIRECTION IN ORDER TO KEEP ON

35:52 THE TRAJECTORY THEY WANT TO. JONATHAN: SLOWLY MOVING PAST THE

35:58 SO-CALLED CLERICAL ERROR LOOKING THIS MORNING UP THE

36:03 BACK OF FAIRLY DECENT EARNINGS.

36:06 >> EVIDENTLY TAYLOR SWIFT IS ONE TO THANK.

36:10 SHE IS THE REASON WHY RIDESHARING SERVICES >>.

36:14 >>EVERY SINGLE CONVERSATION I DIDN'T REALIZE UBER WAS UP AT

36:16 CLOSE TO 100% OVER THE LAST YEAR.

36:18 >> THEIR EARNINGS HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE.

36:20 WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HOW LONG HER PEOPLE GET TO SPEND $30 TO GET

36:24 THE $12 SALAD. THERE'S A QUESTION OF HOW MUCH

36:28 PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY SPEND ON THIS STUFF AND IT TURNS OUT

36:29 THEY CAN KEEP SPENDING. THIS TO ME HIGHLIGHTS THE

36:32 ABILITY OF CONSUMERS TO SPEND. MAYBE THEY WANT TO BECAUSE IT'S

36:37 TAYLOR SWIFT AND BEYONCE. OTHER THING SPEAK TO AN

36:41 INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF CASH THAT HAS NOT RUN OUT. JONATHAN:

36:47 DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT RHYMES WITH SWEET AND GREEN.

36:50 MAYBE LESS THAN IT USED TO HAS. I'M SAYING MAYBE THIS MIGHT BE

36:56 A THING WITH A PLACE THAT RHYMES WITH SWEET AND GREEN.

37:00 YOU ASK FOR CHICKEN AND IT'S JUST A COUPLE OF STRANDS.

37:04 THEY GET THE SORT OF CARCASS AND THEY SPRAY OFF WHAT MEAT IS

37:05 ON IT. THAT'S WHAT IT FEELS LIKE WHEN

37:08 YOU GO TO SOME OF THOSE PLACES. IF YOU'RE ENJOYING YOUR

37:12 BREAKFAST I'M SORRY.

37:14 SOME OF THOSE -- JONATHAN: THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A

37:19 WHILE. AT WHAT POINT ARE PEOPLE WILLING TO PAY TO GET MORE

37:22 CHICKEN.

37:26 >> MAY BE THE PRESIDENT IS UP TO SOMETHING.

37:28 >> MAY BE LONGER.

37:32 >> YOU GET INSTEAD OF EIGHT OUNCES YOU GET SIX OUNCES.

37:37 >> THIS IS THE TREATMENT.

37:43 IT'S NOT RED MAYBE IT IS. EQUITIES NOW ON THE S&P 500

37:45 POSITIVE BY ONE THIRD OF 1%. LET'S GET AN UPDATE ON STORIES

37:47 ELSEWHERE. HERE'S DANI BURGER.

37:51 >> HOUSE REPUBLICANS VOTED BY THE NARROWEST POSSIBLE MARGIN

37:56 TO IMPEACH THE HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY.

37:58 IN AN ATTEMPT LAST WEEK TO IMPEACH THE SECRETARY FAILED

38:02 AFTER A DEADLOCK. ONE LAWMAKER RETURNED FROM

38:04 CANCER TREATMENT TO REVERSE THE EMBARRASSING DEFEAT.

38:08 MAYORKAS BECOMES THE SECOND CABINET MEMBER IN U.S.

38:10 HISTORY TO BE IMPEACHED EERIE THE EFFORT IS LIKELY TO DIE IN

38:13 THE SENATE WHERE TWO THIRDS MAJORITY IS NEEDED TO REMOVE

38:15 HIM FROM OFFICE. SHARES IN AIRBNB ARE LOWER IN

38:17 THE EARLY TRADE. BUT, BUT HE REPORTED STRONG

38:23 FOURTH-QUARTER RESULTS ON POST-PANDEMIC TRAVEL DEMAND.

38:26 AIRBNB EXPECTS THE NUMBER OF NIGHTS AND EXPERIENCES BOOKED

38:31 TO MODERATE THIS QUARTER AS DEMAND NORMALIZES.

38:36 JEFF BEZOS HAS SOLD ANOTHER $2 BILLION OF AMAZON SHARES AFTER

38:38 HE SOLD $2 BILLION LAST WEEK. REGULATORY FILINGS SHOW THE

38:44 SALE TOOK PLACE OVER FOUR TRADING DAYS.

38:47 THE WORLD SECOND RICHEST MAN HAS SAID HE PLANNED TO DISPOSE

38:50 AS MANY AS 50 MILLION SHARES OF THE COMPANY HE FOUNDED.

38:53 THAT'S YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF. JONATHAN: APPRECIATE IT.

38:58 INCREDIBLE MARKET TIMING OR THE MOST PHENOMENAL MIDLIFE CRISIS

39:04 IN HUMAN HISTORY. JUST AMAZING.

39:07 CAN YOU IMAGINE HAVING THAT KIND OF ACCESS.

39:12 -- ACCESS TO THAT KIND OF MONEY. LISA:

39:16 BASICALLY HE LEFT WASHINGTON STATE IN NOVEMBER AND GOES TO

39:19 FLORIDA AND HE THINK HE SAVED SOMETHING LIKE -- ANNMARIE:

39:23 7% TAX IN WASHINGTON STATE, YOU GET NONE OF THAT IN THE

39:29 SUNSHINE STATE. LISA: HE PROBABLY SAVED 288 MILLION

39:32 DOLLARS SO FAR BECAUSE OF THAT MOVE IN TAXES. JONATHAN:

39:37 ISN'T THAT INCREDIBLE? YOU CAN SAVE BY MAKING THAT

39:38 MOVE. LISA: ARE YOU PLANNING ON MOVING TO

39:42 FLORIDA? JONATHAN: I DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH CASH.

39:47 IF I DID WITHOUT A DOUBT. I WOULD GO SAILING INTO THE

39:50 WHOLE THING. LISA: LEMON GROVE SPRAYED JONATHAN:

39:55 ALL OF IT -- LEMON GROVE'S. JONATHAN: ALL OF THAT. U.S.

39:59 INFLATION RUNNING HOT.

40:04 >> THE STRENGTH OF THIS ECONOMY HAS FONDLED -- BEFORE THE

40:10 ECONOMY -- BEFUDDLED ECONOMISTS. THEY HAVE A LOT OF BULLETS LEFT

40:13 IN THE GUN. JONATHAN: THE CONVERSATION COMING UP NEXT.

40:17 THIS IS BLOOMBERG. ♪

40:42 JONATHAN: EQUITIES ON THE S&P 500

40:44 POSITIVE ONE THIRD OF 1%. DOWN ON THE 10 YEAR.

40:51 UNDER SURVEILLANCE THIS MORNING, U.S.

40:55 INFLATION RUNNING HOT.

40:57 >> THE STRENGTH OF THIS ECONOMY HAS BEFUDDLED ALL YOUR GUESTS.

41:04 IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE THE DOT PLOTS HAVE BEEN, EVEN THOSE

41:07 WITH INFORMATION OF MISSED THIS. SOME SIGNS OF A HARDENED

41:12 ECONOMIC CONDITION FINALLY COMING UP.

41:14 I THINK THE FED HAS MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE.

41:17 THEY PUT THEMSELVES IN AN INTERESTING POSITION WHERE YOU

41:20 CAN MUTE VOLATILITY AND HAVE A LOT OF BULLETS LEFT. JONATHAN:

41:26 PUSHING BACK FED RATE CUT BETS AFTER THE CPI PRINT PRINT THE

41:31 TEAM AT MORGAN STANLEY FORECASTING PCE.

41:34 WE THINK THE SEQUENTIAL PRINCE IN THE FIRST QUARTER WILL BE

41:38 OVERALL HIGHER THAN WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS.

41:41 THIS WILL BE ONE FACTOR DELAYING THE DECISION TO START

41:44 CUTTING RATES TO JUNE OF LAST YEAR.

41:47 SARAH BOTH JOINS US TO GET INTO THAT DATA.

41:51 CAN WE COMPARE AND CONTRAST WHAT GOES INTO CPI AND PCE AND

41:55 HOW WIDE IS THAT SPREAD IN TERMS OF WHERE THESE NUMBERS

42:01 ARE.

42:02 >> PCE IS EVERYTHING YOU SPEND IN EVERYTHING TO GETS PAID ON

42:04 BEHALF OF YOU. THINK OF HEALTH INSURANCE PAID

42:06 YOUR EMPLOYER PAYS FOR THAT ON BEHALF OF YOU.

42:11 THERE'S ALSO DIFFERENT WEIGHTINGS.

42:19 THE WAITING WITH CONSUMER PREFERENCES AND SO TYPICALLY

42:20 CPI AND PCE RUN VERY CLOSELY. WE ARE SEEING A PRETTY LARGE

42:23 WEDGE BETWEEN THE TWO MEASURES. RIGHT NOW CPI HAS BEEN RUNNING

42:28 QUITE A BIT ABOVE PCE. OUR IMPLICATIONS RIGHT BASED ON

42:34 CPI IS ACTUALLY .3 CORE PCE COMPARED TO A .4.

42:39 IT'S LOOKING A LITTLE BETTER AND ONE OF THE KEY THINGS IS

42:40 THAT CORE SERVICES LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE SOFTER IN THE PCE

42:46 PRINT THAN THE VERY HOT CORE SERVICES IN CPI. LISA:

42:51 NORMALLY YOU WOULD EXPECT SOME KIND OF COMMENTARY FROM FED

42:56 OFFICIALS.

42:57 IAN SAID TYPICALLY YOU WOULD LOOK TO THE FED TO DELIVER

43:00 ASSURANCES THAT A SINGLE DATA POINT DOES NOT MAKE A TREND BUT

43:02 WE ARE SKEPTICAL OF THAT APPROACH.

43:06 YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW TRYING TO EXPLAIN AWAY THE STRENGTH OF

43:09 CPI BECAUSE THE BROAD-BASED NATURE OF PRICE INCREASES.

43:11 DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT?

43:15 >> IT WAS DEFINITELY A BROAD-BASED INCREASE THIS MONTH.

43:20 IF YOU LOOK AT THE BRATS OF ACCELERATION IN THE CPI PRINTED

43:26 WAS FAIRLY WIDE.

43:26 LOOKING AT THE CLEVELAND FED MEAN MEASURE WHICH SHOWED A

43:27 NOTABLE ACCELERATION. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER IT IS ONE

43:30 DATA PRINT. WE SAW THREE PLUS MONTHS OF

43:38 SOFT CPI AND PCE PRINCE WHICH GAVE US A LOT OF CONFIDENCE THE

43:39 INFLATION WAS ON THE RIGHT TRAJECTORY.

43:43 THIS IS WHY THE FED SAID THEY WANTED TO SEE A FEW MORE PIECES

43:48 OF INFLATION TO BELIEVE INFLATION WAS SUSTAINABLY

43:49 MOVING TOWARDS 2%. YOU CAN GET SOME OUTLIERS LIKE

43:54 THIS WHERE CPI RE-ACCELERATES. RIGHT NOW I BELIEVE THEY WILL

43:59 SAY IT IS ONE DATA POINT BUT THEY WILL KEEP WATCHING SO IT

44:01 DOESN'T CHANGE THE FED'S TRAJECTORY.

44:05 IF ANYTHING IT KEEPS JUNE FIRMLY ON THE TABLE WHERE IT'S

44:06 JUST ENOUGH TIME TO GET A FEW MORE PRINTS AND FEEL CONFIDENT

44:09 THIS IS JUST A ONE-OFF. WE GET THREE MORE CPI PRINTS

44:17 AHEAD THE FED MEETING AND MORE ON THE DAY OF THE NEXT FED

44:20 MEETING IN JUNE AND THEN WE GET THREE MORE JOB -- FOR MORE JOB

44:23 REPORTS. IT'S -- THERE IS MORE DATA TO

44:28 COME BEFORE THAT MEETING IN THE SUMMER. LISA:

44:34 ANALYSTS SAYING THIS WAS SIGNIFICANT AND THIS IS A GAME

44:36 CHANGER WHEN IT COMES TO THE BROADENING OUT.

44:39 YOU CAN JUST EXPLAIN THIS BY SEASONALS.

44:45 IS THERE A MESSINESS UNDER THIS DATA IT MAKES IT DISMISSIBLE A

44:46 SORT OF A BLIP? SARAH: THERE'S ISSUES WITH THE

44:51 SEASONAL FACTORS. WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF NOISE

44:56 AND MAYBE A BAD SIGNAL ON THE SEASONAL FACTORS.

45:00 BUT WE ALSO KNOW SOME OF THESE ARE ON THE RIGHT TRAJECTORY.

45:05 SHELTER ACCELERATED THE LATEST BUT ALL THE FORWARD-LOOKING

45:10 INDICATORS ON THE NEW TENANT INDEX SHOWING TOO MUCH COOLER

45:12 PATH FOR SHELTER INFLATION IN THE BACK HALF OF THE YEAR.

45:16 I THINK WE CAN FEEL CONFIDENT THE FORWARD-LOOKING DATA IS

45:21 STILL LOOKING FAIRLY SOLID WHICH IS ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THE

45:22 OVERALL BASKET. YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER CORE

45:24 SERVICES. I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE ARE A

45:28 LITTLE BIT MORE CONCERNED. WE'VE BEEN SEEING PROGRESS AND

45:31 WAGES FOR ABOUT A YEAR NOW. WITH THIS RE-ACCELERATION IT

45:38 CALLS INTO QUESTION CAN WE FEEL CONFIDENT CORE SERVICES AND

45:40 HOUSING WILL REMAIN ON THE RIGHT TRAJECTORY.

45:45 IT'S YET TO BE SEEN AND HARD TO KNOW IF THIS WE ACCELERATION IS

45:46 HERE TO STAY OR IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A ONE-OFF AND WE WILL

45:50 SEE URGING IN THE FEBRUARY AND MARCH DATA.

45:53 IT BEARS WATCHING BUT IT'S TOO EARLY TO CALL IT OUT AS THIS IS

45:55 THE FUTURE OF INFLATION.

46:01 >> THE RICHMOND FED PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THESE

46:03 COMPANIES THAT HAD TO RAISE SOME OF THEIR PRICES AND SAYS

46:05 IT'S CONCEIVABLE NOW THAT'S OFF THE TABLE.

46:08 THEY CONTINUE TO DO THIS WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE BASIC

46:10 FOOD PRICES GOING UP. THEY WILL HAVE TO MAINTAIN

46:15 THESE ELEVATED PRICES TO MAINTAIN A PROFIT. SARAH:

46:19 IT WILL BE TRICKY FOR THEM BECAUSE WE KNOW THE CONSUMER IS

46:22 BECOMING MORE PRICE-SENSITIVE PARTICULARLY IN THE LOWER TO

46:23 MIDDLE INCOME DISTRIBUTION. EVEN THOUGH LABOR COSTS ARE

46:28 HIGH IT FORCES IT TO PUSH SOME OF THAT PRICING THROUGH WE KNOW

46:31 IT'S BECOMING INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF THE

46:34 HOUSEHOLD PULLING BACK ON THEIR SPENDING. LENDING STANDARDS ARE

46:38 TIGHTENING. IT'S LESS ABOUT THAT WILLINGNESS TO TAKE PRICE AMONG

46:44 HOUSEHOLDS AND THAT WILL BE PUSHING BACK AGAINST BUSINESSES

46:47 AND THEIR ABILITY TO PASS THE PRICE. JONATHAN:

46:50 LET'S TALK ABOUT THE WEATHER IN RETAIL SALES.

46:53 WHEN PAYROLLS CAME IN JUST BEFORE IT PEOPLE TOLD ME IT WAS

46:57 WARM SO PAYROLLS WOULD BE GOOD AND NOW I'M BEING TOLD IT'S

47:01 COLD. HOW IS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO?

47:04 IS IT A SURVEY WE?

47:07 >> IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A BIT OF A SURVEY WEEK PROBLEM.

47:10 THE FIRST HALF OF JANUARY MOSTLY CAPTURED IN THE PAYROLL

47:14 REPORT. THE BACK HALF WAS COLDER.

47:17 RETAIL SALE CAPTURED THE ENTIRE ZONE.

47:21 THE WARM WEEKS AND THE COLD WEEKS PRE-WHAT WE ARE LOOKING

47:24 FOR IS A -.5% ON THE MONTH. PART OF IT IS THE WEATHER BUT

47:27 MOST OF IT IS SEASONAL FACTORS.

47:33 NOT TO GET NERDY HERE BUT HISTORICALLY THE SEASONAL

47:34 FACTORS LOOK FOR MASSIVE HOLIDAY SPENDING IN NOVEMBER

47:38 AND DECEMBER AND A BIG DROP OFF IN JANUARY.

47:41 THE SEASONAL FACTORS HAVE BEEN MESSED UP FOR RETAIL SALES IN

47:44 THE LAST FEW MONTHS WITH NORMAL HOLIDAY SPENDING PATTERNS.

47:49 WE THINK THAT'S KNOCKING TO BE ADDING ENOUGH BACK INTO RETAIL

47:51 SALES IN JANUARY EVEN HOW STRONG NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER

47:53 SALES WERE. AND SO BE LOOKING FOR THAT.

48:00 THE UNFRIENDLY SEASONAL FACTORS FOR THURSDAY.

48:02 RETAIL SALES WILL RESULT IN A NEGATIVE PRINT.

48:05 WE THINK THAT TAKES SOME OF THE PRICING BACK FOR JULY INTO JUNE

48:10 SHOWING A LITTLE BIT MORE DECELERATION IN CONSUMER

48:13 SPENDING AND THAT MAYBE SOME OF THAT STRENGTH WE SAW IN

48:16 NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER RETAIL SALES WAS THE BAD SEASONAL

48:18 FACTORS IN THE OTHER DIRECTION AS WELL. JONATHAN:

48:20 APPRECIATE THE CLARITY.

48:22 GOOD TO SEE YOU, SARAH WOLFE OF MORGAN STANLEY.

48:26 LOOKING FOR A NEGATIVE NUMBER. HERE AT BLOOMBERG THE MEDIAN

48:31 ESTIMATE -0.2%. LISA:

48:37 IF YOU STRIP OUT SOME OF THE SEASONALITY'S THE CONTROL GROUP

48:39 IS SET TO HAVE AN INCREASE. IF YOU GET A HOTTER THAN

48:42 EXPECTED PRINT FOR RETAIL SALES WHAT DOES THAT DO FOR MARKET

48:44 ACTION. THAT I THINK WOULD BUILD ON

48:50 MAYBE NOT A NARRATIVE SHIFT BUT MAY BE A LITTLE GUT PUNCH.

48:55 JONATHAN: YOU LOVE THIS GOLDILOCKS.

48:57 REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU ABOUT THIS WITH THE CARTOONS AND

49:02 TUNING INTO BUSINESS NEWS. THE FAIRYTALE CHARACTERS

49:05 GETTING SMACKED AROUND. BY ECONOMIC DATA.

49:09 >> IT'S PRETTY EXCITING. TRACY OF WELLS FARGO, MICHAEL

49:14 SHEPPARD OF BLOOMBERG NEWS.

49:21 COLIN MARTIN AT CHARLES SCHWAB. EQUITY FUTURES ON THE S&P 500

49:25 POSITIVE BY 0.4 PERCENT. LIVE FROM NEW YORK THIS IS

49:26 BLOOMBERG.

49:43 >> THE DEPTH AND BREADTH HAS SURPRISED ECONOMIST ACROSS THE

49:45 BOARD AND IT'S A MUCH MORE RESILIENT ECONOMY.

49:48 >> WE ARE NOT SEEING ANY SIGNS OF IT YET.

49:51 >> WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE HEALTH OF THE MARKET YOU STILL HAVE TO

49:52 ARGUE IT'S PRETTY RAW.

49:56 >> THE BILLING FOR EQUITIES TO GO HIGHER AS EARNINGS, CLEAR IS

49:58 WHAT WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON.

50:02 >> THE EQUITY MARKETS IS THE SOFT LANDING IS CONTINUING.

50:08 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE WITH JONATHAN

50:09 FERRO, LISA ABRAMOWICZ AND ANNMARIE HORDERN. JONATHAN:

50:12 THE SECOND HOUR OF BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE BEGINS NOW.

50:18 GOOD MORNING FOR OUR AUDIENCE WORLDWIDE.

50:19 THIS IS BLOOMBERG ALONGSIDE LISA ABRAMOWICZ WITH ANNMARIE

50:21 HORDERN. YOUR EQUITY MARKET PRICING BACK

50:25 ON THE S&P 500 BY 0.5%. PLENTY OF JOKES ABOUT THE MOVE

50:28 OVERNIGHT. A RIDICULOUS MOVE OFF THE BACK

50:31 OF NUMBERS THAT WERE NOT REAL. 500 BASIS POINT GUIDANCE FOR

50:37 MARGIN EXPANSION TURNS OUT TO BE JUST 50. THE STOCK FADES.

50:43 GOOD NEWS FOR UBER SHAREHOLDERS, THIS ONE DROPPING

50:46 MOMENTS AGO ANNOUNCING A $7 BILLION SHARE BUYBACK. LISA:

50:50 WHICH BUILDS ON THE BUYBACKS AND DIVIDENDS WE'VE HEARD FROM

50:51 A LOT OF COMPANIES. IT FEELS LIKE THERE'S A NEW

50:54 EMPHASIS ON THAT WITH THE RECORD PRAY PACE -- WITH THE

50:59 RECORD PACE OF THESE. THIS COMES AS INSTACART LAID

51:02 OFF A WHOLE HOST OF PEOPLE AND AUTHORIZE SHARED BUYBACKS AND

51:07 DIVIDENDS. THERE SEEMS TO BE A NEW FOCUS

51:10 ON DISTURBING CAPITAL IN AN ERA WHERE PEOPLE WANT INCOME FROM

51:12 THOSE SHARES BECAUSE THEY ARE GETTING A LOT OF MONEY AND THE

51:16 OWNERS WANT TO GET SOME DECENT BACK. JONATHAN:

51:22 BUYBACKS FOR UBER, DIVIDEND AT META, THE FIRST ONE.

51:24 THESE ARE BIG CHANGES. LISA: ESPECIALLY THE TIME OF HOW

51:27 PROFITABLE SOMEONE IS. THESE COMPANIES ARE MEETING IT

51:33 AND THAT'S A SHOCKING THING AT A TIME WHEN WE WERE SUPPOSED TO

51:35 BE TALKING ABOUT DECELERATE A GROWTH. JONATHAN:

51:38 THE TAKEAWAY ON THE SOUTH SIDE, CITI SERVICES INFLATION IS

51:43 STICKY. IT IS A NIGHTMARE ON BIDEN

51:47 STREET. ANNMARIE: WHAT YOU WILL SEE FROM THE

51:52 WHITE HOUSE IS REMEMBER WHERE WE WERE AND LOCALE FAR WE'VE

51:58 COME BUT THE TREASURY SECRETARY SAYS SHE WAS LOATH TO TALK

51:59 ABOUT ANYONE VARIABILITY. THE ISSUE IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT

52:03 WHAT'S GOING UP IT'S ISSUES YOU CANNOT ESCAPE.

52:08 EVERY DAY AMERICANS ARE REMINDED GROCERY PRICES ARE

52:10 GOING UP. THE ONLY GEM IN THIS PRINT

52:18 REPORT WAS THAT GASOLINE PRICES DECREASED SO MUCH AND THERE'S

52:20 ALSO POTENTIAL INTO THE SUMMER THAT COULD PICK UP.

52:23 >> IS IT TOO SOON TO TALK ABOUT REVERSE GOLDILOCKS PRAY JUST

52:27 ONE PAYROLLS REPORT. ACID MANUFACTURING GETS CLOSER

52:30 TO EXPANSION. IT'S JUST ONE ECONOMIC DATA

52:34 POINT. SERVICES COMES OUT HOTTER THAN

52:35 EXPECTED. EARLY DAYS DON'T PUT TOO MUCH

52:39 WEIGHT ON IT. JUST A DRIP FEED OF HOTTER THAN

52:42 EXPECTED DATA.

52:46 >> IF YOU GET THE SAME FOR RETAIL SALES HOW MUCH DOES THAT

52:47 PLAY INTO IT. THE QUESTION IS GOOD NEWS BAD

52:51 NEWS. AT WHAT POINT IS THERE A HEADWIND AND IT'S NOT THERE YET.

52:59 THAT'S THE CONSENSUS FROM A LOT OF DIFFERENT ANALYSTS SAYING

53:02 OUR BASE CASE REMAINS POSITIVE ON STRONG ECONOMIC DATA AND A

53:04 DOVISH LEANING FED. DO WE LOOK AT A SITUATION WHERE

53:08 BONDS GET BLOWN OUT AND STOCKS DO WELL.

53:11 IS THAT THE DICHOTOMY WE ARE SEEING AT A TIME WHERE

53:14 INFLATION IS STICKIER. JONATHAN: WE SAID LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC

53:21 MIX RIGHT NOW, DOESN'T FAVOR ONE ASSET CLASS OVER ANOTHER.

53:25 UNDERWEIGHT BONDS, OVERWEIGHT EQUITIES. JONATHAN:

53:31 WHY WOULD YOU WANT -- LISA: WE HEARD THAT YESTERDAY FROM

53:32 DAVID KELLY. YOU CAN THE COUPON. IF YOU WANT THE COUPON GO FISH.

53:38 IF NOT MAYBE GO TO EQUITIES.

53:41 >> EQUITY FUTURES ON THE S&P 500 POSITIVE BY 0.5%.

53:46 IN THE BOND MARKET YIELDS SHAPING UP AS POLICY -- AS

53:47 FOLLOWS.

53:53 BACK ON THE TWO-YEAR DOWN TO 42868.

53:57 COMING UP THIS HOUR, WHY IT'S TIME TO GET DEFENSIVE AND

53:59 STOCKS AND BONDS. MICHAEL SHEPPARD ON THE

54:01 REPUBLICAN SHRINKING MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE AND NVIDIA'S

54:04 RELENTLESS RISE TO THE TOP.

54:11 ALSO COVERING OTHER BIG TECH NAMES AS WELL.

54:12 A LOT TO GET INTO A LITTLE BIT LATER.

54:19 LISA: CASH DISTRIBUTION IS A NEW ACQUISITION IN THE TECH WORLD.

54:24 >> MARKETS SHAKEN BY STICKY INFLATION.

54:27 SIGNALING A SMALLER REBOUND FOLLOWING YESTERDAY'S SLUMP.

54:31 TRACY OF THE WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT INSTITUTE SAYING THE

54:33 FED IS LIKELY TO PUT OFF ITS FIRST RATE CUT UNTIL JUNE.

54:36 I'M RECOMMENDING INVESTORS LIGHTEN UP ON THE TOP 12 MONTH

54:40 PERFORMANCE INCLUDING TECH, CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY.

54:43 TRACY JOINS US RIGHT NOW. I WANT TO RECAP SOME OF YOUR

54:46 CALLS INTO THIS YEAR. YOU SAID MARCH AND A RATE CUT

54:51 IN MARCH WAS TOO EARLY. YOU SAID MARKET PRICING WAS TOO

54:55 AGGRESSIVE. SO FAR SO GOOD. YOU SAID SERVICES EXPANSION

55:00 WILL FALL INTO CONTRACTION. BASED ON WHAT WE'VE HEARD THIS

55:05 YEAR THIS ONE LOOKS SHAKY. IS THAT STILL YOUR VIEW?

55:07 >> YES EIGHT IS.

55:13 WE THINK WE WILL START TO SEE SOME WEAKNESS IN CONSUMER

55:17 REALLY ON THE MARGINS AND WE ARE BASING THIS ON A COUPLE OF

55:20 THINGS. FIRST OF ALL WE ARE STARTING TO

55:23 SEE DELINQUENCIES THAT ARE CONCERNING AND CREDIT CARDS AND

55:24 LOANS. MORTGAGE DELINQUENCIES HAVE

55:31 ALSO STARTED TO RISE AND STUDENT LOANS ARE PROBABLY NEXT.

55:35 WE ARE ALSO SEEING A LABOR MARKET THAT IS NOT QUITE AS

55:44 TIGHT AS IT HAS BEEN, JANUARY'S PRINT ASIDE.

55:45 IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS STARTING TO

55:52 WEAKEN ON THE MARGINS WITH OUR AVERAGE HOURLY WORKWEEKS

55:56 DECLINING AND ALSO WITH TEMPORARY WORKERS ALSO STARTING

55:57 TO DECLINE. THAT'S WHERE COMPANIES CAN

56:05 START TO CUT EMPLOYMENT ON THE MARGINS AND SO WE THINK THOSE

56:09 TWO FACTORS ARE PROBABLY GOING TO PLAY INTO A LITTLE WEAKNESS

56:13 IN THE CONSUMER AND A BIT OF A SLOWDOWN AS WE MOVE INTO THE

56:14 NEXT COUPLE OF QUARTERS. LISA: WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE TO SEE TO

56:18 CHANGE YOUR VIEW ON THAT? TRACIE:

56:25 WE WOULD WANT TO SEE A CONTINUATION OF STRONG LABOR

56:29 MARKETS AND WE ALSO WANT TO SEE SOME REVERSAL IN THOSE

56:33 DELINQUENCY NUMBERS. THOSE CREDIT CARDS GETTING UP

56:36 TO A LEVEL WHERE WE THINK THAT IS STARTING TO BE CONCERNING.

56:42 RETAIL SALES YOU MENTIONED THAT EARLIER, WE WOULD WANT TO SEE

56:47 THOSE CONTINUE TO COME IN RELATIVELY STRONG ALTHOUGH LIKE

56:49 YOU SAID THAT COULD BE A PROBLEM FOR INFLATION.

56:54 EITHER WAY WE THINK THAT THE FED IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE

57:00 HERE UNTIL AT LEAST JUNE AND SO THAT IS CAUSING THIS REPRICING

57:02 THAT WE ARE SEEING IN EQUITY MARKETS. LISA:

57:07 WE'VE HEARD FROM A HOST OF DIFFERENT INVESTORS THAT THEY

57:10 PREFER STOCKS OVER BONDS IN A TIME WHERE INFLATION IS STICKY

57:14 AND WE ARE DEALING WITH BOND YIELDS THAT HAVE NOT FULLY

57:17 REFLECTED THE FACT THE FED WILL CUT RATES BUT ONLY THREE TIMES

57:18 THIS YEAR. OUR STOCKS A BETTER PICTURE

57:23 RIGHT NOW ALBEIT DEFENSIVE THAN BONDS?

57:26 >> WE THINK EQUITIES AND FIXED INCOME MARKETS ARE BOTH

57:30 OVERBOUGHT. WE ARE A BIT OVERWEIGHT FIXED

57:34 INCOME AT THIS POINT. IN THE SHORT-TERM, PART OF THAT

57:36 CURVE. WE THINK THAT THAT IS A GOOD

57:42 HOLDING PLACE HERE WHILE WE WAIT TO SEE IF THIS CHOPPINESS

57:45 IN THE MARKETS IS GOING TO CONTINUE.

57:52 THE S&P 500 HAS BEEN UP 14 OF THE LAST 15 WEEKS AND SO A 10%

57:57 CORRECTION AT ANY POINT DURING THE YEAR IS PRETTY NORMAL.

58:02 WE WANT TO WAIT FOR MAY BE A BIT OF A RESET IN EQUITY PRICES

58:06 BEFORE WE WANT TO MOVE SOME OF THAT SHORT-TERM FIXED INCOME

58:08 BACK INTO THE EQUITY MARKETS.

58:12 >> WHERE DO YOU SEE LEADERSHIP ON THE WAY DOWN? TRACIE:

58:16 ON THE WAY DOWN IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE SIMILAR TO WHERE

58:19 IT'S BEEN ON THE WAY UP. THE LARGEST OF THE LARGE CAPS

58:23 HAVE BEEN OUTPERFORMING SINCE MARCH. THEY'VE BEEN DRAMATICALLY

58:27 OUTPERFORMING SMALL CAPS. WE THINK THERE WILL BE A TIME

58:34 TO INVEST IN SMALLER CAP COMPANIES, WE THINK THAT THAT

58:37 IS NOT GOING TO OCCUR UNTIL WE START TO SEE EVIDENCE OF A TURN

58:43 IN THE CYCLE, IN EARLY CYCLE IS WHERE WE TEND TO SEE THOSE

58:44 PERFORM BETTER. WE ARE CONTINUING TO OVERWEIGHT

58:49 LARGE CAPS AND ESPECIALLY QUALITY LARGE CAPS.

58:54 >> LISA HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT BUYBACKS TAKING PLACE

58:55 SPECIFICALLY AROUND THESE BIG TECH NAMES.

58:59 WHEN YOU WAIT FOR THAT DRAWDOWN, THE PULLBACK IN THIS

59:04 EQUITY MARKET, AREN'T YOU FIGHTING THOSE FORCES?

59:07 HOW POWERFUL ARE THOSE BUYBACK PROGRAMS? TRACIE:

59:10 THEY ARE POWERFUL AND THEY CAN EXERT UPWARD PRESSURE ON

59:15 MARKETS. WE THINK THAT IS GOING TO

59:18 COUNTERACT TO SOME EXTENT THE WEIGHT THAT HIGHER INFLATION

59:25 AND THE FED WILL HOLD FOR LONGER TO EXERT ON MARKETS.

59:28 THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY WE ARE FAVORING COMPANIES WITH

59:30 GOOD CASH POSITIONS, COMPANIES THAT HAVE LOW DEBT BECAUSE

59:36 THOSE ARE THE ONES LIKELY TO INITIATE THESE BUYBACKS AND

59:39 POTENTIALLY CONTINUE TO RISE EVEN IF THE BENCHMARK INDEX AS

59:44 A WHOLE HAS WEAKNESS. LISA: I WAS STRUCK BY INSTACART IN

59:51 PARTICULAR BECAUSE THEY DISCUSSED WEIGHT -- LAYING OFF

59:53 AS A GIVING A PART OF THEIR FORCE AND AUTHORIZING SHARE

59:56 BUYBACKS. IS THIS SOMETHING WE WILL SEE

59:59 THAT COMPANIES AND STOCKS WILL KEEP DOING WELL EVEN IF THE

01:00:03 ECONOMY STARTS TO SOUR MORE MATERIALLY? TRACIE:

01:00:06 THAT IS A POSSIBILITY. CERTAINLY FOURTH QUARTER

01:00:11 EARNINGS WERE POSITIVE FOR THE LARGEST OF THE LARGE CAPS.

01:00:16 BUT NOW COMPANIES ARE STARTING TO SAVE -- SAY THAT THEY ARE

01:00:22 LESS CONFIDENT THAT THEY CAN PASS ALONG HIGHER PRICES SO WE

01:00:26 THINK THAT COULD WEIGH ON MARGINS AND THAT'S PROBABLY WHY

01:00:28 YOU ARE STARTING TO SEE SOME OF THESE COST-CUTTING EFFORTS

01:00:33 WHICH INCLUDE REDUCING THE SIZE OF THEIR WORKFORCE AND

01:00:35 EVENTUALLY THAT WILL WEIGH ON

01:00:41 THE LABOR MARKETS AND SO ALL OF THIS IS GOING TO COUNTERBALANCE

01:00:43 SOME POSITIVES FROM THE COST CUTS.

01:00:46 >> APPRECIATE THE UPDATE ON SOME OF YOUR CALLS.

01:00:48 TRACY OF WELLS FARGO. WE TALKED ABOUT SMALL CAPS

01:00:51 BRIEFLY. SMALL CAPS YESTERDAY THE

01:00:55 RUSSELL DOWN 4%. I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THAT WAS

01:01:01 THE BIGGEST ONE-DAY DROP GOING BACK TO 2022.

01:01:04 WE HAD THE REGIONAL BANKS GETTING ABSOLUTELY BATTERED BUT

01:01:09 WE WERE DOWN BY SOMETHING LIKE 3%, YESTERDAY WAS ABSOLUTELY

01:01:15 DREADFUL >> IT RAISES THE QUESTION IF WE HAVE THE

01:01:18 NARRATIVE WRONG SAYING YOU'RE MISSING THE PLOT.

01:01:21 WE SAW A RISE IN SMALL CAPS HEADING INTO LAST YEAR AND THE

01:01:24 RESPONSE TO THE IDEA OF THE FED PIVOT AND THIS GOLDILOCKS

01:01:26 NARRATIVE. IF YOU ARE SEEING A LITTLE BIT

01:01:28 TAKEN OFF THE TOP IT'S BECAUSE OF WORRIES ON THE HANGOVERS

01:01:31 FROM DEBT ESPECIALLY. THIS IS GOING TO BE ONE OF THE

01:01:34 BIG DEBATES. WHEN DO THEY START TURNING

01:01:37 AROUND. WHEN IS THE RATE SECURITY WHERE

01:01:41 YOU UNDERSTAND THINGS ARE GOING? JONATHAN:

01:01:47 I DON'T THINK HE HAD THAT HOT CPI PRINT IN MIND WHEN HE MADE

01:01:48 THOSE COMMENTS. LET'S GET YOU AN UPDATE ON

01:01:52 STORIES ELSEWHERE. HERE'S YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF

01:01:55 WITH DANI BURGER. DANI:

01:02:01 DEFENSE SECRETARY LLOYD AUSTIN HAS BEEN RELEASED FROM THE

01:02:03 HOSPITAL AFTER UNDERGOING A PROCEDURE FOR A BLADDER PROBLEM.

01:02:08 HE HAD CANCELED A PLANNED TRIP TO BRUSSELS TO ME WITH OTHER

01:02:10 DEFENSE CHIEFS AND WILL JOIN VIRTUALLY THIS MORNING.

01:02:16 AUSTIN WAS HOSPITALIZED FOLLOWING COMPLICATIONS FROM

01:02:18 PROSTATE CANCER WHICH SPARKED FEAR BECAUSE HE WAITED DAYS TO

01:02:24 INFORM THE PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS PRAY DONALD TRUMP WILL

01:02:26 LIKELY DRAIN HIS WAR CHEST FOR LEGAL FEES.

01:02:29 IT LEAVES HIM CRUNCHED FOR CASH AHEAD OF NOVEMBERS POLLS.

01:02:35 TRUMP SPENT $50 MILLION ON LEGAL EXPENSES AND COULD TOP

01:02:38 ANOTHER 26 MILLION FROM AN ALLIED SUPER PAC TO PAY HIS

01:02:39 LAWYERS.

01:02:46 THOSE FUNDS ARE EXPECTED TO DRY UP AROUND JULY AS THE RNC

01:02:48 TRIGGERS THE START TO THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN.

01:02:51 IT FORCES THE FRONTRUNNER TO TAP THE PARTY OR DONORS FOR

01:02:52 MORE CASH. UNICREDIT WILL INCREASE ITS

01:02:57 BONUS POOL BY 16%. THE ITALIAN LENDER POSTED

01:03:01 RECORD PROFITS AND INCREASED SHAREHOLDER RETURNS.

01:03:07 THE AVERAGE GAIN WILL BE HIGHER THAN 2023 WITH INCREASES

01:03:10 BETWEEN 9% AND 27% ACCORDING TO SOURCES. IT BUCKS THE TREND OF

01:03:16 INVESTMENT BANKS PLAN TO REDUCE POOLS AFTER A CHALLENGING YEAR

01:03:19 FOR THEIR SECURITIES UNITS. THAT'S YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF.

01:03:24 >> UP NEXT ON THE PROGRAM, DEMOCRAT TOM SUOZZI WINNING THE

01:03:27 NEW YORK SPECIAL ELECTION.

01:03:31 >> SENDING A MESSAGE TO OUR FRIENDS IN CONGRESS THESE DAYS.

01:03:36 STOP RUNNING AROUND FOR TRUMP AND START RUNNING THE COUNTRY.

01:03:40 JONATHAN: THAT CONVERSATION UP NEXT.

01:03:43 THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

01:03:46 ♪

01:04:03 JONATHAN: STOCKS BOUNCING A LITTLE BIT ON

01:04:07 THE S&P 500 POSITIVE BY 0.5%. EURO TOTALLY UNCHANGED.

01:04:12 BOND MARKET REWINDING SOME OF THE MOVES.

01:04:15 DOUBLE DIGITS THROUGH MUCH OF THE CURVE YESTERDAY.

01:04:21 UNDER SURVEILLANCE THIS MORNING, DEMOCRAT TOM SUOZZI

01:04:26 WINNING THE NEW YORK SPECIAL ELECTION.

01:04:28 >> IT'S TIME TO MOVE BEYOND THE PARTISAN BICKERING AND

01:04:32 FINGER-POINTING. IT'S TIME TO FOCUS ON HOW WE

01:04:37 SOLVE THE PROBLEMS. >> THIS IS TO OUR FRIENDS RUNNING CONGRESS

01:04:42 THESE DAYS, STOP RUNNING AROUND FOR TRUMP AND START RUNNING

01:04:45 AROUND -- START HELPING. JONATHAN:

01:04:51 OUSTING REPUBLICAN GEORGE SANTOS, REPUBLICANS CURRENTLY

01:04:56 HOLDING 219 SEATS TO DEMOCRATS 212.

01:04:59 LIKE A SHEPHERD JOINS US OUT OF WASHINGTON DC.

01:05:01 LET'S GO TO THOSE NUMBERS. HOW MUCH OF THAT WAS A

01:05:03 REFERENDUM ON JOE BIDEN?

01:05:07 >> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.

01:05:14 THIS WAS -- MANY HAVE BEEN LOOKING TO THIS ELECTION AS

01:05:19 SOMETHING TO SAY MORE ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN NOVEMBER

01:05:24 BETWEEN JOE BIDEN AND DONALD TRUMP, THIS IS THE REMATCH

01:05:26 NOBODY HAS WANTED YET WE ARE ALL HEADING TOWARDS.

01:05:30 BUT ALSO WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE TWO PARTIES AS THEY TRY TO GAIN

01:05:35 CONTROL OF THESE TWO CLOSELY CONTESTED CHAMBERS HERE IN

01:05:40 WASHINGTON. ANNMARIE:

01:05:41 IT'S AN UNNERVING MARGIN THAT SPEAKER JOHNSON WAKES UP TO.

01:05:45 HE WANTS TO PUT PARTISAN BILLS ON THE FLOOR LIKE THE ONES TO

01:05:47 IMPEACH SECRETARY MAYORKAS. MICHAEL:

01:05:48 THIS IS THE LAST THING HE WANTED OUT OF THIS SPECIAL

01:05:54 ELECTION. HE'S ALREADY BEEN DEALING WITH

01:05:57 THIS NARROW MARGIN. HE CAN ONLY AFFORD TO LOSE TO

01:06:03 REPUBLICANS ON ANY PARTY-LINE VOTE AND AS YOU MENTIONED THIS

01:06:08 IMPEACHMENT LOST A COUPLE OF REPUBLICANS WHO WERE

01:06:12 QUESTIONING WHETHER IT WAS JUSTIFIED AND WHETHER THEY HAD

01:06:16 IT UNDER THE CONSTITUTION TO SUCCEED.

01:06:18 SO IF MIKE JOHNSON RUNS INTO ANY TIGHT SPOT WHERE HE NEEDS

01:06:23 REPUBLICAN VOTES, HE RUNS THE RISK OF FALLING SHORT

01:06:27 POTENTIALLY AGAIN AND AGAIN IF THIS ISSUE COMES UP?

01:06:34 TOM SUOZZI HASN'T BEEN SWORN IN YET BUT THE MARGIN WILL BE TO

01:06:37 19-213.

01:06:38 >> I FEEL LIKE AFTER THE ELECTION HE IS KNOWN AS MR.

01:06:44 BORDER. WHAT MESSAGE DOES THAT SEND TO

01:06:48 THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT THE BORDER ISSUE

01:06:53 GIVEN THE FACT THIS WAS A TOP ELECTION ISSUE FOR VOTERS IN

01:06:55 LONG ISLAND IN THE NORTHEAST OF THE UNITED STATES. MICHAEL:

01:06:59 IMMIGRATION AND THE BORDER ARE REALLY TOP ISSUES ACROSS THE

01:07:04 BOARD. IN OUR BLOOMBERG SWING STATE

01:07:07 POLL WE FOUND SIX IN 10 VOTERS PLANE PRESIDENT BIDEN FOR THE

01:07:12 TROUBLES WE ARE SEEING AT THE BORDER WITH THE SURGE OF

01:07:16 MIGRANTS CROSSING AND JUST THE SENSE NATIONALLY THAT THE

01:07:17 SITUATION IS OUT OF CONTROL. THAT CERTAINLY NEW YORK WHICH

01:07:26 HAS HAD 170,000 MIGRANTS IN RECENT YEARS, MANY OF THEM

01:07:28 SHIPPED UP THERE BY THE TEXAS GOVERNOR GREG ABBOTT, ALL OF

01:07:33 THAT IS COMING HOME TO ROOST IN TRADITIONALLY DEMOCRATIC AREAS

01:07:37 LIKE NEW YORK AND VOTERS ARE WONDERING WHAT IS THE PRESIDENT

01:07:42 GOING TO DO. WHAT WAS INTERESTING IN THE

01:07:46 REMARKS LAST NIGHT WAS HE TALKED -- HE WAS ADDRESSING

01:07:51 REPUBLICANS AND AT THE ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION.

01:07:53 SAYING WE NEED TO GET THINGS DONE.

01:07:56 HE WAS ADDRESSING PEOPLE ON THE OTHERS OF THE AISLE AND WE

01:08:00 RECALL REPUBLICANS WALKED AWAY FROM THE BIPARTISAN DEAL ON THE

01:08:06 BORDER THAT INCLUDED AID FOR UKRAINE, ISRAEL AND TAIWAN.

01:08:09 IT WAS ONE THAT BIDEN AGREED TO AND WAS READY TO SIGN YET UNDER

01:08:12 PRESSURE FROM TRUMP THEY BACKED AWAY. LISA:

01:08:16 IS THERE A LESSON TO THIS THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE KNOWN TO GET

01:08:18 REELECTED AND PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT OUR MUCH SCARIER. MICHAEL:

01:08:28 IN THIS CASE, SUOZZI WAS WELL-KNOWN TO THE DISTRICT.

01:08:32 HE HAD REPRESENTED IT FOR SIX YEARS, HE LEFT CONGRESS AFTER

01:08:35 2022 TO RUN FOR GOVERNOR, IT DID NOT WORK OUT.

01:08:38 HE STILL GOT THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION.

01:08:43 HIS BRAND NAME STILL HELD SOME SWAY.

01:08:47 WHAT'S INTERESTING IS IN NASSAU COUNTY REPUBLICANS REALLY

01:08:48 CONTROL THE POLITICAL APPARATUS THERE.

01:08:54 THE DISTRICT SPANS BOTH PLANES OF NASSAU COUNTY SO HE WOULD BE

01:08:59 THE LOAN COUNTYWIDE IN A WAY REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE

01:09:02 DEMOCRATIC PARTY. HE WOULD BE REPRESENTING THEM.

01:09:05 HIS FAMILIARITY WITH VOTERS CERTAINLY HELP.

01:09:12 IT HELPED TO RAISE MONEY AND GET SPENDING.

01:09:15 HE WAS ABLE TO OUT RAISE HIS OPPONENT BY A THREE TO ONE

01:09:16 MARGIN.

01:09:24 >> IS THERE A COMPLETE LACK OF ENTHUSIASM RIGHT NOW AND LOW

01:09:27 TURNOUT?

01:09:32 >> THERE IS ONE QUESTION ABOUT THIS ELECTION, OF THE 2024

01:09:37 ELECTION ABOUT WHETHER VOTERS ARE EXHAUSTED, WHETHER THEY

01:09:38 HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF POLITICS.

01:09:47 CERTAINLY NASSAU COUNTY EXECUTIVE FLAG TO THAT AS AN

01:09:49 ISSUE YESTERDAY. SAYING IN THE MORNING IT WAS A

01:09:51 LITTLE ROUGH. HE SAID TURNED OUT UP IN THE

01:09:55 AFTERNOON AS THINGS CLEARED UP. BUT IT WAS MORE THAN JUST THE

01:09:58 WEATHER CLEARLY. PEOPLE ARE FATIGUED WITH

01:10:03 POLITICS AND YET THE STAKES ARE VERY HIGH IN THIS ELECTION AS

01:10:07 WE HEAD INTO A REMATCH OF JOE BIDEN AND DONALD TRUMP.

01:10:11 JONATHAN: THE REMATCH NOBODY WANTED YOU

01:10:12 SEE IN POLL AFTER POLL. THIS IS WHY THERE'S SO MUCH

01:10:15 FATIGUE. PEOPLE ARE SICK OF IT. WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT DEALS

01:10:21 THAT CAN GET THROUGH THE SENATE BUT NOT THE HOUSE.

01:10:25 THINGS THEY CAN GET THROUGH THE HOUSE BUT NOT THE SENATE.

01:10:27 CAN WE TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT MIGHT PASS BOTH CHAMBERS

01:10:29 AND THAT'S A BIPARTISAN TAX EFFORT.

01:10:32 HOW CLOSE ARE WE TO THAT TAKING PLACE. MICHAEL:

01:10:36 WE SEEM TO BE INCHING CLOSER AND CLOSER.

01:10:39 ONE OF THE ISSUES IS HOW THIS GETS PAID FOR.

01:10:43 THEY ARE WORKING THIS ONE THROUGH THE PROCESS NOW.

01:10:48 WE ARE HOPING FOR A LITTLE BIT OF ACTUAL MOVEMENT LATER THIS

01:10:49 WEEK. BUT I WILL NEVER BET ON CONGRESS DOING ANYTHING ON TIME

01:10:56 OR ON SCHEDULE, ESPECIALLY WITH THE TIGHT PARTISAN MARGINS.

01:11:00 THERE ARE SOME REPUBLICANS WHO WERE CONCERNED IN PARTICULAR

01:11:04 INCLUDING THE STATE AND LOCAL TAX BREAKS THAT DEMOCRATS IN

01:11:08 PARTICULAR ARE LOOKING TO RESTORE.

01:11:16 THOSE FAVOR METROPOLI AND SUBURBAN AREAS OF THE NATION

01:11:19 BUT FOR A LOT OF REPUBLICANS THEY FEEL THAT THAT BENEFITS

01:11:22 DEMOCRATIC DISTRICTS AND STATES MORE THAN REPUBLICAN ONES,

01:11:27 HENCE THEY ARE MORE HESITANT WITH SOMETHING THAT HAS THAT

01:11:28 PROVISION. JONATHAN: MICHAEL DOWN IN WASHINGTON DC.

01:11:34 A CONSTRUCTIVE WAY OF FRAMING THIS IS THIS IS A FIXTURE OF

01:11:38 DEMOCRACY, NOT A BUG. IT'S MEANT TO BE MESSY. LISA:

01:11:43 I ADHERE TO THAT. JONATHAN: THIS IS THE BILL, THIS IS THE

01:11:46 LAW. LISA: YOU HAVE TO HAVE PEOPLE WILLING

01:11:50 TO CONSIDER THE LAW BEFORE THEY VOTE ON IT.

01:11:53 THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MESSINESS BUILT IN AND A

01:11:58 FEATURE OF DEMOCRACY AND A MESSINESS THAT IS A FEATURE OF

01:12:01 POLITICS AND PEOPLE TRYING TO CREATE A CERTAIN IMAGE FOR

01:12:04 TIKTOK OR INSTAGRAM OR TWITTER. IT JUST FEELS A LITTLE BIT

01:12:11 DIFFERENT WHEN PEOPLE AREN'T WILLING TO CONSIDER THE ACTUAL

01:12:14 LINE ITEMS. THEY ARE JUST TALKING ABOUT SOME BLANKET

01:12:15 IDEOLOGY. ANNMARIE:

01:12:21 IT'S ALSO HARDER FOR LAWMAKERS TO REACH ACROSS THE AISLE AND

01:12:24 GET A BIPARTISAN BILL DONE AND THE FACT WE ARE GETTING EVER

01:12:25 CLOSER TO NOVEMBER ELECTION.

01:12:31 DO REMEMBER WE GOT BIPARTISANSHIP PREVIOUSLY.

01:12:33 WE HAD A HARD INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE AND THE CHIPS AND

01:12:36 SCIENCE ACT. WHEN CONGRESS HAS HAD TO ACT IN

01:12:40 CERTAIN THINGS THEY WANT TO GET DONE THEY WERE ABLE TO.

01:12:44 THE CLOSER WE GET TO NOVEMBER EVERY SINGLE DECISION WILL

01:12:47 BECOME POLITICAL.

01:12:48 >> ISN'T THIS WHAT'S BASICALLY WINDING YOU UP NOW?

01:12:53 YOU SEEM TO BE FURIOUS ABOUT THE SNOW YESTERDAY, THE FACT

01:12:55 THERE WAS HARDLY ANY. LISA: IT WAS NOT GOOD SNOW. JONATHAN:

01:13:00 WHAT WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS QUALITY SNOW? ANNMARIE:

01:13:08 THERE'S NO ISSUES VOTING, IT WAS LAME SNOW.

01:13:11 >> IT FELL, IT WAS WET. THE KIDS GET MOD ALL OVER

01:13:16 BECAUSE THEIR BASE WITH HIS SLEDDING IN A MUD PATCH.

01:13:19 YOU GO TO CENTRAL PARK IT LOOKS LIKE TIMES SQUARE.

01:13:23 EVERYONE'S TRYING TO SLED AND IT WAS JUST NOT ACCURATE.

01:13:27 >> ARE YOU SUGGESTING ERIC ADAMS WOULDN'T MAKE A GOOD

01:13:28 METEOROLOGIST? LISA: YOU ARE JUST TRY TO WIND ME UP.

01:13:33 [LAUGHTER] JONATHAN: THESE ARE JUST QUESTIONS.

01:13:45 NVIDIA'S METEORIC RISE, COMING UP NEXT FROM NEW YORK CITY.

01:13:47 THIS IS BLOOMBERG. ♪

01:14:08 JONATHAN: STOCKMARKETS BOUNCING BACK.

01:14:13 THE RUSSELL AND SMALL CAPS YESTERDAY DOWN 4%, THE BIGGEST

01:14:16 ONE-DAY LOSS COMING BACK TO THE SUMMER OF 2022.

01:14:21 FUTURES BOUNCING BACK ON THE NASDAQ BY .65%, THE S&P 500

01:14:26 HIGHER BY .5%. LET'S GO TO THE TWO-YEAR.

01:14:32 ABOUT 40 BASIS POINTS.

01:14:39 THAT IS DOWN TO 4.6265. WHAT IS INTERESTING ABOUT THE

01:14:44 LAST 24 HOURS OVER THE LAST SIX WEEKS IS THAT YIELDS HAVE BEEN

01:14:47 REPRICING HIGHER ALL YEAR OFF THE BACK OF FIRMER THAN

01:14:49 EXPECTED DATA BUT EQUITIES HAVE HELD UP UNTIL YESTERDAY UNDER

01:14:53 CPI PREP. LISA: IT SEEMED TO BE A GUT CHECK OR

01:14:57 GOT PUNCHED, AS SOME WOULD SAY. WHEN YOU LOOK AT INFLATION

01:15:01 MOVING HOTTER THAN EXPECTED ACROSS THE BOARD, YOU ASKED A

01:15:03 REALLY GOOD QUESTION, IS THIS MORE OF A MARKET PROBLEM THAN

01:15:05 FED PROBLEM? IT RAISES THIS QUESTION,

01:15:11 THOUGH, ESPECIALLY IF THERE IS A BROADENING OUT OF SERVICES

01:15:13 INFLATION ABOUT HOW LONG HIGHER FOR LONGER REALLY IS.

01:15:16 IT RAISES THE QUESTION OF HOW STICKY INFLATION IS THAT A LOT

01:15:20 OF PEOPLE THOUGHT WAS TRANSITORY. JONATHAN:

01:15:24 THAT OFFICIALS CAN CARRY ON SAYING THE SAME THING, THIS IS

01:15:27 WHY WE WANTED TO WAIT. WAIT FOR MORE GOOD DATA.

01:15:33 AND IF ANYTHING, WE SAID NO TO MARCH.

01:15:36 THOSE THREE CUTS, THEY STILL LOOK OK FOR 2024.

01:15:39 CAN THAT CHANGE THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS?

01:15:42 IT CAN, BUT THE MARKET WAS PRICED WAY MORE AGGRESSIVELY

01:15:48 THAN THAT.

01:15:49 DAVID KELLY AND JP MORGAN SAID THAT IT IS A COLLECTIVE AVERAGE

01:15:54 OF A WHOLE RANGE OF VIEWS, A HARD LANDING, SOFT LANDING, AND

01:15:56 THAT DOES NOT SPEAK TO SOMETHING SUPER PRECISE, BUT

01:16:00 EQUITIES ARE AT ALL-TIME HIGHS AND SPREADS ARE TIGHT, AND WITH

01:16:03 YIELDS COMING BACK IN, A SO-CALLED EVERYTHING RALLY THE

01:16:07 LAST THREE MONTHS, THAT SPEAKS TO THE SOFT LANDING THAT THE

01:16:08 FED WAS LOOKING FOR. LISA: JUST TO BUILD IT UP, IT IS

01:16:14 BASICALLY SAYING THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE LOOKING FOR A HARD

01:16:18 LANDING, A SOFT LANDING, AND IT IS THE AVERAGE OF THE TWO, AND

01:16:21 PEOPLE LOOKING FOR THE HARD LANDING, IT'S NOT LOOKING

01:16:24 LIKELY NOW, SO HOW MUCH DOES THIS REALLY START TO LEAN

01:16:30 TOWARD OVER INFLATING IN SOME SORT OF SIGNIFICANT WAY?

01:16:32 THAT IS WHAT MARKETS ARE GRAPPLING WITH MORE NOW.

01:16:33 JONATHAN: THE U.K. IS WONDERING IF THEY ARE

01:16:38 SPOOKED BY HOTTER THAN EXPECTED INFLATION DATA AND THEY WERE

01:16:39 NOT.

01:16:46 IF YOU GO TO STERLING, WE ARE -5.3%, THE U.S. DOLLAR, 1.2555.

01:16:52 MONTH OVER MONTH, WE WERE LOOKING FOR -0.3 M EGOT -0.6,

01:16:56 SO THE RIGHT KIND OF DOWNSIDE TO PRICE THE U.K.

01:17:01 AND THE BANK OF ENGLAND IS STILL LOOKING FOR A COUPLE OF

01:17:03 HIKES. I THINK THOSE HAWKISH ONES GOT

01:17:06 CLICKED BY THE DATA THIS MORNING. LISA:

01:17:09 PEOPLE ARE NOW CALLING FOR NEXT MONTH OR THE MONTH AFTER, AND

01:17:15 IT KIND OF HIGHLIGHTS HOW DIFFERENT INFLATION STORY IS IN

01:17:18 EACH REGION. IT IS NOT THE SAME ACROSS THE

01:17:19 WORLD. IT IS KIND OF SUPPLY DRIVEN,

01:17:24 LIKE WHAT WE SAW A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. JONATHAN:

01:17:27 WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR THE BANK OF JAPAN TO START HIKING

01:17:33 INTEREST RATES.

01:17:34 OUR TOP STORY THIS MORNING, RAISING ALL OF THE GAINS THEY

01:17:42 HAVE MADE, STICKING TO CPI DATA IN AMERICA, DASHING INVESTOR

01:17:45 HOPES THAT THE CENTRAL BANK WOULD START CUTTING RATES

01:17:46 SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. WE WILL HEAR FROM THE CHICAGO

01:17:50 FED PRESIDENT AND THE FED VICE CHAIR LATER TODAY.

01:17:54 ULTIMATELY, ARE YOU EXPECTING ANY CHANGE OF COMMUNICATION

01:17:57 FROM THEM WHATSOEVER BASED ON YESTERDAY'S PRINT? LISA:

01:18:00 I WAS WONDERING, DOES THIS MATTER?

01:18:02 IS THERE ANYTHING RELEVANT FROM THESE COMMENTS?

01:18:07 THERE WILL BE, BUT IT IS COMPELLING THAT ANALYSTS ARE

01:18:08 SAYING IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THEY SAY THIS IS

01:18:10 JUST ONE DATA PRINT. IF THEY DO, THAT COULD BE

01:18:16 VIEWED AS DOVISH, AND YOU COULD SEE THAT PUSHED INTO MARKETS

01:18:19 WHERE WE EXPECT CUT RATES IN JUNE AND WE PROGRESSED FROM

01:18:21 THERE. IF THEY DON'T AND SAY THIS IS

01:18:24 CONCERNING OR WE NEED TO LOOK MORE CAREFULLY AND WE NEED TO

01:18:28 SEE SUPER COURT COME DOWN MORE AGGRESSIVELY, THAT WILL BE

01:18:29 TREATED AS HAWKISH, AND THAT WILL TIP THE SCALES. JONATHAN:

01:18:34 FIRST REACTION FROM THE FED LATER THIS MORNING.

01:18:38 THE LATEST ON THE POLITICS, HOUSEBUILDING BY THE NARROWEST

01:18:41 MARGIN TO IMPEACH OTHER MAYORKAS AFTER FAILING IN THEIR

01:18:43 FIRST ATTEMPT LAST WEEK. HE BECAME THE SECOND CABINET

01:18:49 MEMBER IN HISTORY TO BECOME IMPEACHED, THE LAST ONE WAS

01:18:53 NEARLY 150 YEARS AGO, AND THE EFFORT IS LIKELY TO DIE IN THE

01:18:55 SENATE, WHERE A TWO THIRDS GEORDIE IS NEEDED TO REMOVE HIM.

01:18:57 THIS IS WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT ALL MORNING, THERE ARE THINGS

01:19:01 THAT THE HOUSE ARE ABLE TO DO AND THE SENATE WILL NOT GO WITH

01:19:05 AND VICE VERSA. ANNMARIE: THIS IS POLITICS, NOT POLICY.

01:19:08 THE HOUSE HAD TO TAKE UP THE BILL AGAIN BECAUSE IT WAS AN

01:19:11 ABSOLUTE EMBARRASSMENT FOR SPEAKER JOHNSON TO PUT

01:19:13 SOMETHING ON THE FLOOR THAT HE PROMISED HIS FACE HE WOULD DO

01:19:16 AND THEN NOT HAVE THEM VOTE AT THE END OF THE DAY TO SHORED UP.

01:19:20 TO GET THIS ACROSS THE FINISH LINE, WE CANNOT JUST IMAGINE

01:19:22 HOW TIGHT THESE NUMBERS ARE. STEVE SCALISE IS UNDERGOING

01:19:26 TREATMENT FOR CANCER, BLOOD CANCER.

01:19:29 HE CAME BACK TO CONGRESS TO TAKE THE VOTE.

01:19:32 IF TOM SUOZZI WAS THERE, THAT VOTE NEVER WOULD HAVE GONE

01:19:37 THROUGH. THAT IS HOW TIGHT THE MARGINS

01:19:40 ARE, AND THAT IS WHAT IT IS HARD TO GET ANYTHING DONE,

01:19:42 ESPECIALLY CLOSER TO A BIPARTISAN WAY. JONATHAN:

01:19:46 LET'S FINISH ON A LIGHTER NOTE FOR JEFF BEZOS, THE AMAZON

01:19:50 FOUNDER AND CHAIRMAN SELLING $4 BILLION WORTH OF THE COMPANY

01:19:55 STOCK IN FOUR DAYS, AND HE HAS NOT SOLD SHARES SINCE 2021.

01:20:00 HE STILL HAS A SIGNIFICANT STAKE IN THE COMPANY, HOLDING

01:20:06 9.3% OF OUTSTANDING SHARES, AND AMAZON STOCK IS UP 11% SO FAR

01:20:08 THIS YEAR. HE WENT THROUGH THE NUMBERS,

01:20:13 LET'S HEAR THEM AGAIN, THE TAX IMPLICATIONS OF DOING THIS NOW

01:20:14 VERSUS BEFORE. ANNMARIE: HE LEFT WASHINGTON STATE AND

01:20:19 WENT TO FLORIDA, IN WASHINGTON STATE, IF YOU HAVE GAINS OF

01:20:25 $250,000 FOR THE CAPITAL GAINS TAX, 7% IS WHAT YOU ARE TAXED.

01:20:29 ZERO IS WHAT YOU ARE TAXED IN FLORIDA, SO IF HE WAS EVER

01:20:31 THINKING OF UNLOADING, IT WAS WISE TO MOVE FIRST AND THEN

01:20:34 UNLOAD TO BUY A LOT MORE. JONATHAN:

01:20:37 FOUR DAYS, 4 BILLION, COULD YOU IMAGINE? LISA:LISA:

01:20:41 AND THE SAVINGS, 288 MILLION, SO WHAT IS HE GOING TO DO WITH

01:20:48 IT?

01:20:49 ANNMARIE: I AM SURE THERE ARE LOTS OF

01:20:52 OTHER THINGS TO DO. JONATHAN: WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING? LISA:

01:20:57 HE HAS A YACHTS, ISLANDS, STYLISTS. JONATHAN:

01:20:58 BUILDING ROCKETS.

01:21:05 ALL AROUND THE CLOCK. YOU SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT THAT.

01:21:07 LISA: I SPENT A LOT OF TIME LOOKING

01:21:08 AT THE CRUISE LINE. JONATHAN: I AM NOT SURE JEFF BEZOS IS

01:21:12 GOING ON THAT CRUISE LINE ANYTIME SOON.

01:21:20 PROBABLY A VERY LONELY EXPERIENCE.

01:21:23 HOW MANY STREET BLOCKS WAS THAT? LIKE 3, 6? LISA:

01:21:27 IT IS BASICALLY A SKYSCRAPER. JONATHAN:

01:21:32 MY SORT OF IDEA OF HOW TO GO ON THAT CRUISE SHIP.

01:21:33 WHAT WAS IT LIKE? LISA: THERE WAS AN ARTICLE, TALKING

01:21:38 ABOUT DOING IT WITHOUT THE ADD-ONS AND WHAT THAT WOULD BE

01:21:44 LIKE. I FOUND IT COMPELLING. JONATHAN:

01:21:48 LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING WE WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS, NEW

01:21:52 YEAR, NVIDIA LEADING BIG TECH HIGHER ED AGAIN AFTER JUMPING

01:21:56 MORE THAN 200% LAST YEAR, AND ADDING ROUGHLY HALF $1 TRILLION

01:22:01 TO ITS MARKET CAP, AND FORCING THEM TO CHASE THIS RALLY.

01:22:08 WE ARE JOINED FOR MORE BY PIERRE FERRAGU.

01:22:14 TALK ABOUT THE PRICE TARGET. LAST TIME I LOOKED, IT WAS 700,

01:22:22 CAN THIS NAME KEEP BEATING AND RATING THROUGH 2024? PIERRE:

01:22:25 GOOD QUESTION. WHEN IT COMES TO EARNINGS

01:22:31 MOMENTUM, THINGS FOR 2024 LOOK VERY SOLID AND GOOD FOR NVIDIA

01:22:36 FOR MANY REASONS, WHICH IS THERE ARE WAY MORE PEOPLE WHO

01:22:45 NEED GPU'S AND THE SUPPLY CHAIN PROVIDES THEM, SO YOU CAN SEE

01:22:54 THE DIVIDEND, AND IT IS GOING TO LET THEM DO AS WELL AS THEY

01:22:55 CAN IN MANUFACTURING. WHEN YOU LOOK AT MANUFACTURING,

01:23:02 YOU LOOK AT THE WORST CASE SCENARIO, AND YOUR EXECUTION IS

01:23:08 BETTER, AND YOU END UP WINNING, SO I THINK WE ARE GOING TO SEE

01:23:10 THAT.

01:23:18 IF YOU LOOK AT THE LAST 15 MONTHS, IT BECOMES VERY

01:23:22 VISIBLE, AND EVERYBODY KNOWS

01:23:29 IT, AND NOW THE QUESTION IS, IT TRIPLED LAST YEAR, SO EVEN

01:23:37 IF WE SEE AN ADDRESSABLE MARKET THAT IS GROWING VERY FAST,

01:23:43 DOUBLING ON YEAR AND THEN DOUBLING AGAIN YEAR-OVER-YEAR,

01:23:48 IT IS DIFFICULT TO KNOW EXACTLY WHERE THE RISE STARTS, BUT VERY

01:23:52 CLEARLY, THEY ARE ANTICIPATING THESE REVISIONS. JONATHAN:

01:23:57 IT IS A CHIP RELATED FRENZY IN THE EQUITY MARKET.

01:24:05 YOU HAVE THE BUY ON NVIDIA, INTEL, ROD,.

01:24:08 THERE IS A NEUTRAL ON ASML. WHERE DISSENT NEUTRAL COME FROM?

01:24:13 WHY ARE YOU CONSTRUCTIVE ON ALMOST A COMPLETE UNIVERSE BUT

01:24:17 NOT THAT NAME? PIERRE: LET'S TAKE A STEP BACK.

01:24:22 THE AI MARKET, THIS YEAR, IT IS GOING TO BE LIKE 80 BILLION,

01:24:33 AND IN 2027, IT COULD BE 400 BILLION, SO YOU SHOULD EXPECT

01:24:38 TO HAVE HAD READINGS ON EVERYBODY.

01:24:47 WHEN YOU LOOK AT ASML, WHAT WE SEE IS THAT THEY ALMOST HAVE

01:24:55 THEIR BUSINESS FROM CHINA, AND THERE IS A 20, 20 5% LAGGING OF

01:25:04 CHIPS, AND WHAT WE SEE TODAY, WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF PRESSURE

01:25:11 ON CHINA TO SPEND LESS, AND WE THINK THE LAGGING HAS BEEN

01:25:14 OVERSPENDING FOR A YEAR, AND IS

01:25:24 NOW CLEARLY CUTTING, AND ALL THESE PLAYERS ARE CUTTING CAPEX

01:25:29 SO WE JUST SAY, THEY ARE GOING TO BENEFIT FROM AI.

01:25:35 IN ORDER TO BUILD 400 BILLION SHIPS IN 2027, WE NEED TO SPEND

01:25:41 AHEAD OF THAT $50 BILLION IN ORDER TO HAVE THE LINES READY,

01:25:44 SO THAT IS GOING TO BE A LOT OF BUSINESS FOR AI, COMING AT A

01:25:49 TIME WHERE THE BUSINESS OF TODAY IS GOING TO PULL BACK.

01:25:57 THE ONLY ONE ON WHICH WE HAVE A HIGH RATING IS FOR THE SIMPLE

01:26:02 REASON THAT IT IS VERY LITTLE EXPOSED TO THE LAGGING EDGE OF

01:26:04 CHINA COMPARED TO OTHER PLAYERS. LISA:

01:26:09 I AM CURIOUS HOW MUCH YOU ARE LOOKING FOR DIVIDENDS AND SHARE

01:26:15 BUYBACKS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY SUPPORT BUY RECOMMENDATIONS AND

01:26:17 THE OTHERS NOT LIKE ASML. GIVEN WHAT WE SAW FROM UBER AND

01:26:22 A WHOLE HOST OF OTHERS? PIERRE:

01:26:30 I DON'T REALLY HAVE THAT ON MY SCREEN TO BE HONEST. IF YOU ARE

01:26:36 NVIDIA TODAY, YOU HAVE THIS IDEA OF MAYBE YOUR MARKET COULD

01:26:42 BE $400 BILLION IN 2027, BUT YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

01:26:47 IT IS LIKE WE ARE DISCOVERING WHAT AI COULD BE AND HOW FAST

01:26:57 USAGE IS GROWING, SO IT IS CERTAINLY A POSSIBILITY.

01:27:04 WE COULD END UP HALFWAY THERE, AND NVIDIA HAS NO CONTROL OVER

01:27:05 THAT. MICROSOFT HAS NO CONTROL ON

01:27:07 THAT. IT IS GOING TO BE A GAME OF HOW

01:27:14 FAST THE SERVICES ARE BEING ADOPTED AND HOW FAST THE

01:27:18 SERVICES ARE PROGRESSING, SO IF

01:27:24 THINGS SLOW DOWN, YOU WOULD BE DISAPPOINTED.

01:27:29 IF THINGS START OFF ON A BILLION, YOU COULD HAVE A

01:27:31 MARKET UNDER 200 BILLION.

01:27:37 IF THAT HAPPENS, WITHOUT EVEN A POINT

01:27:41 IN TIME, IF YOU LOOK AT BUYBACKS AND DIVIDENDS, --

01:27:46 JONATHAN: JUST TO JUMP IN, I JUST WANTED

01:27:53 TO FINISH RUBA. WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THAT

01:27:54 BUYBACK FROM THEM THIS MORNING? PIERRE:

01:28:00 WELL, WE SAY IN THE RIDESHARING BUSINESS, IT IS VERY EASY, IF

01:28:04 YOU MANAGE TO GET THE LARGEST MARKET SHARE, ONLY A SINGLE

01:28:13 COMPETITOR WILL HAVE THE VERY HALFTIME, AND, CASH MACHINE,

01:28:18 AND THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED THE LAST FOUR YEARS.

01:28:22 IF YOU ARE A CASH MACHINE AND THE STREET IS STILL RELATIVELY

01:28:28 CAUTIOUS IN THE WAY IT VALUES YOUR BUSINESS, ONE OF THE BEST

01:28:29 THINGS YOU CAN DO IS TO BUYBACK

01:28:39 YOUR OWN STOCK, SO WE ARE SO HAPPY TO SEE THAT IT IS WHAT WE

01:28:41 ARE EXPECTING. JONATHAN: THE STOCK IS POSITIVE THIS

01:28:45 MORNING, UP BY 6%. WONDERFUL TO HEAR FROM YOU.

01:28:55 UBER THIS MORNING WITH ITS FIRST SHARE BUYBACK.

01:28:57 UP ABOUT 6%. LISA: IF THEY HAVE THE CASH, THAT IS

01:29:01 WHAT THEY ARE DOING WITH IT. THEY ARE GROWING AT THE HOTTEST

01:29:04 SPACE EVER TO START A YEAR. JONATHAN:

01:29:09 A $7 BILLION SHARE BUYBACK. HERE IS YOUR BLOOMBERG REEF

01:29:10 WITH DANI BURGER. DANI:

01:29:16 SHARES IN AIRBNB OR LOWER AFTER THEY REPORTED STRONG

01:29:20 FOURTH-QUARTER RESULTS BUT SUGGESTED EARLY 2024 DEMAND IS

01:29:22 WANING. EARNINGS INITIALLY CAME IN

01:29:26 STRONG AFTER POST-PANDEMIC TRAVEL DEMAND, BUT AIRBNB

01:29:30 EXPECTS A NUMBER OF NIGHTS AND EXPERIENCES BOOK THAT IT WILL

01:29:35 LIKELY MODERATE THIS QUARTER AS DEMAND NORMALIZES.

01:29:38 THIS STOCK HAS BEEN ON A WILD RIDE SINCE YESTERDAY AFTERNOON.

01:29:41 THE RIDESHARING COMPANY POSTED EARNINGS THAT BEAT ESTIMATES,

01:29:43 BUT A CLINICAL ERROR CAUSED THEM TO SURGE A WHOPPING 67%.

01:29:51 SINCE THEN, IT HAS COME DOWN TO 19% IN THE EARLY TRADE.

01:29:55 THE MISTAKE, AN EXTRA ZERO IN THE FORECAST FOR MARGINS.

01:29:59 THEY LISTED MARGINS EXPANDING AT 500 BASIS POINTS INSTEAD OF

01:30:00 50. I SPOKE TO DAN IVES ON THE BRIEF EARLIER. DAN:

01:30:07 THIS WAS AN EPISODE OF "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE"

01:30:09 EXCEPT IT WAS REAL. THE SCARY THING HERE IS THAT IT

01:30:11 ACTUALLY GOT THROUGH. IT HAS BEEN A REAL COMEDY SHOW

01:30:19 THAT WE HAVE SEEN FOR YEARS RIGHT NOW, AND EVEN THOUGH IT

01:30:22 IS A GOOD QUARTER, OVERSHADOWED BY ANOTHER MOVEMENT.

01:30:28 DANI: A SPACEX ROCKET HAS BEEN

01:30:35 POSTPONED, NOW TARGETING A LAUNCH EARLY THURSDAY WITH ITS

01:30:39 INTUITIVE MACHINES AIMING TO TOUCHDOWN ON THE LUNAR SURFACE

01:30:43 ONE-WEEK LATER. IF SUCCESSFUL, IT WILL BE THE

01:30:45 FIRST PRIVATE SPACECRAFT TO LAND ON THE MOON. JONATHAN:

01:30:48 APPRECIATE THE UPDATE. NEXT, AN UNEVEN ROAD TO 2%.

01:30:56 >> THERE ARE CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE REPORT THAT PUSH NUMBERS

01:30:58 HIGHER, BUT AS THE YEAR GOES ON, THINK INFLATION IS GOING TO

01:31:00 COME DOWN. JONATHAN: THE LATEST REACTION TO THE

01:31:04 HEART INFLATION PRINT, NEXT.

01:31:25 JONATHAN: ONE HOUR AND 41 MINUTES AWAY

01:31:29 FROM THE OPENING BELL, EQUITY BOUNCING BACK.

01:31:34 THE S&P 500 POSITIVE BY .5%, YIELDS LOWER BY ALMOST ONE

01:31:38 BASIS POINT, AND UNDER SURVEILLANCE THIS MORNING, AND

01:31:39 UNEVEN ROAD TO 2%.

01:31:44 >> MY PERSPECTIVE SAYS, OK, THE ECONOMY IS COOLING BUT MORE

01:31:45 SLOWLY. THERE ARE CERTAIN ASPECTS OF

01:31:49 THE REPORT WHICH PUSH NUMBERS HIGHER, BUT AS THE YEAR GOES

01:31:52 ON, THINK INFLATION WILL SLOWLY COME DOWN ON A YEAR OVER YEAR

01:31:54 BASIS. JONATHAN: HERE'S THE LATEST ON INFLATION

01:32:01 DATA, RAISING THE LAST OF THE BOND ARE GET RALLY WHICH BEGAN

01:32:02 IN DECEMBER.

01:32:08 THIS REPORT THROWS SOME COLD WATER ON THE FED'S RATE CUT

01:32:09 PLANS. WE HAVE BEEN EXPECTING THREE TO

01:32:12 FOUR RATE CUTS THIS YEAR ANYWAY, SO NOWHERE IN LINE WITH

01:32:14 MARKET EXPECTATIONS. NEVER BOUGHT INTO THE

01:32:17 AGGRESSIVE PACE OF RATE CUTS THAT WERE BEING PRICED IN BACK

01:32:23 IN DECEMBER AND EARLY JANUARY, FROM COLLIN MARTIN.

01:32:26 GOOD TO SEE YOU, AS ALWAYS. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS LAST

01:32:31 24 HOURS, WAS THIS A BIGGER SURPRISE FOR THE MARKET THAN

01:32:32 FED OFFICIALS? COLLIN: I THINK SO, BASED ON MARKET

01:32:35 REACTION. MARKET REACTION WAS WARRANTED.

01:32:41 WHEN YOU GET AN EXPECTATION LIKE THAT ACROSS THE BOARD, YOU

01:32:45 WILL SEE MARKETS REACT, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE

01:32:47 EXPECTATIONS FOR THOSE CUTS. IF YOU LOOK AT THE FED, GOING

01:32:50 BACK TO WHAT MOST OFFICIALS HAVE TOLD US, THEY WERE TALKING

01:32:56 ABOUT PATIENCE, THE NEED FOR MORE TIME AND DATA.

01:33:00 THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE ASSURED THAT INFLATION IS MOVING DOWN

01:33:03 TO 2%, AND THIS GIVES THEM MORE TIME TO REEVALUATE THE

01:33:07 LANDSCAPE AND SEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN GOING FORWARD.

01:33:09 WE THOUGHT MARCH WAS TOO SOON. WE ARE STILL IN THAT MAY CAMP

01:33:11 RIGHT NOW. I THINK THE ODDS ARE ABOUT

01:33:18 HUNDRED PERCENT OR SO FOR MAY AS OPPOSED TO JUNE BASED ON FED

01:33:19 FUNDS FUTURES. WE WILL SEE HOW THAT NEXT FEW

01:33:26 MONTHS OF DATA HANDOUT, BUT WE STILL EXPECT THREE OR FOUR, SO

01:33:29 WE DON'T THINK THIS IS A TURNING POINT OR A

01:33:32 RE-ACCELERATION IN INFLATION. LISA:

01:33:33 TO THE POINT DAVID KELLY MADE, IT WASN'T THAT THE MARKET WAS

01:33:37 THINKING IT WAS ABLE TO GET SIX RATE CUTS, BUT IT WAS BETWEEN

01:33:43 12 RATE CUTS AND THREE, AND SPEAKING OF A HARD LANDING, HAS

01:33:48 THE MARKET FULLY PRICED OUT A HARD LANDING AT A TIME WHEN WE

01:33:51 LOOK AT DATA COMING IN HOTTER THAN EXPECTED AND WHERE WE SEE

01:33:54 GROWTH JUST COMING IN STRONGER-THAN-EXPECTED? COLLIN:

01:33:58 YOU COULD ARGUE THEY PRICED OUT A HARD LANDING BASED ON MARKET

01:34:01 INDICATORS, LIKE CREDIT SPREADS, THE STOCK MARKET,

01:34:06 THINGS FALLING OUT HERE, AND THE STOCK MARKET IS AT AN

01:34:11 ALL-TIME HIGH, AND WHAT REALLY SURPRISED ME YESTERDAY WAS

01:34:15 DESPITE THAT STOCK MARKET ACTION, IT HAS TIGHTENED IN THE

01:34:16 CREDIT SPACE. WE SAW HIGH YIELDS TIGHTEN.

01:34:20 THAT IS INDICATIVE OF A HEALTHY ECONOMY.

01:34:25 OTHERWISE, YOU WOULD SEE INVESTORS AND LENDERS EXPECTING

01:34:27 AND REQUESTING HIGHER SPREADS, AND THAT WAS NOT THE CASE.

01:34:32 THAT SHOCKED ME YESTERDAY THAT DESPITE VOLATILITY IN THE

01:34:34 POTENTIAL FOR HIGHER FOR LONGER, THAT WE SAW SPREADS

01:34:35 FALLING MORE. LISA: WE SPOKE EARLIER ABOUT HOW RICH

01:34:42 IS UNDERWEIGHT BONDS BECAUSE YOU WERE EXPECTING IT TO BE A

01:34:45 HIGHER FOR LONGER ENVIRONMENT. DO YOU AGREE THAT IN THE

01:34:50 DURATION SET, THAT IN THE LONGER TERM TREASURIES, YOU SEE

01:34:51 A BIGGER RISK RIGHT NOW THAN YOU DID A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO?

01:34:53 COLLIN: WE DON'T SEE THAT. WE ARE STILL IN THE CAMP THAT

01:35:00 INVESTORS SHOULD GRADUALLY EXTEND DURATION.

01:35:05 IF IT GOES UP 20 BASIS POINTS OR SO IN THE NEXT WEEK, THAT

01:35:08 WILL NOT CHANGE OUR OPINION, WE WOULD NEED TO SEE YIELDS MOVE

01:35:11 SUSTAINABLY HIGHER AND THAT IS IN THE BASE CASE RIGHT NOW.

01:35:15 WE STILL SEE A LOT OF OUR CLIENTS IN SHORT-TERM

01:35:18 INVESTMENTS, AND EVEN IF THE TIMING GETS PUSHED BACK A

01:35:20 LITTLE BIT, WE THINK INVESTORS SHOULD MOVE OUT A LITTLE BIT

01:35:24 AND LOCK IN YIELDS BECAUSE WE DON'T EXPECT A RATE

01:35:27 ACCELERATION IN INFLATION OR THE 10-YEAR TO GET BACK TO 5%,

01:35:29 SO WE ARE NOT UNDERWEIGHT BONDS. WE STILL SUGGEST INVESTORS MOVE

01:35:33 OUT A LITTLE BIT ON THE YIELD CURVE.

01:35:36 AS RELATES TO CREDIT, NEUTRAL ACROSS THE BOARD CREATE THE

01:35:39 STRONGER-THAN-EXPECTED ECONOMY AND THE RESILIENCE WE ARE

01:35:41 SEEING IS A GOOD THING FOR CORPORATIONS, BUT IT IS

01:35:45 VALUATIONS THAT GET US A LITTLE BIT UP THERE, AND HOLDS US BACK

01:35:49 A LITTLE BIT AND FROM BEING MORE ENTHUSIASTIC AND

01:35:50 OVERWEIGHT. JONATHAN: THIS CONVERSATION GRAVITATES TO

01:35:54 FUNDAMENTALS. CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE

01:35:56 PSYCHOLOGY? IN OCTOBER WHEN YIELDS WERE

01:36:02 THROUGH 5%, NOBODY WANTED THEM, AND THEN EVERYONE IS TOLD --

01:36:07 HAS TOLD US THAT IF WE GET BACK UP IN YIELDS, WE ARE GOING TO

01:36:09 BUY. OK, IT IS OVER 40 BASIS POINTS,

01:36:14 WHAT ARE YOUR CLIENTS DOING NOW? ARE THEY HOPING FOR ANOTHER 20

01:36:15 OR 50? COLLIN: I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE NUMBER

01:36:20 IS, BUT, YES, THEY ARE, AND WE HEAR THAT.

01:36:23 PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIORAL IDEAS, WE GET ANCHORED TO THE

01:36:27 5% WE SAW LAST YEAR, AND THAT IS WHAT INVESTORS WERE WAITING

01:36:31 FOR. NOBODY REALLY DOES IN THEN. ONE IS THE HOPE THAT YIELDS GET

01:36:36 BACK TO THAT LEVEL, AND I THINK A LOT OF INVESTORS ARE PROBABLY

01:36:44 SCARRED OF WHAT HAPPENED IN 2021, AND NOW YOU ARE AT 4.2%

01:36:49 ON THE 10-YEAR, BUT LET'S SAY YIELDS DO GO UP, THAT WOULD BE

01:36:52 A HIT TO THE VALUE OF THEIR BONDS, SO THEY HAVE THE HOPE

01:36:55 FOR HIGHER YIELDS AND THEN YOU HAVE THE SKITTISHNESS OF THE

01:36:59 POTENTIAL PRICE DECLINES, SO WE ARE SEEING CLIENTS FOCUS ON

01:37:00 THAT. LISA: HELLO DO YIELDS HAVE TO GO

01:37:03 BEFORE YOU HAVE SHIFTED AWAY FROM DURATION? COLLIN:

01:37:11 MAYBE 3.5% BEFORE WE GET A LITTLE BIT MORE CAUTIOUS.

01:37:15 WE LOOK AT THE 10-YEAR YIELD NOW, BASED ON OUR OUTLOOK FOR

01:37:20 MORE OF A SOFT LANDING, WE ARE SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE.

01:37:27 WE SEE GROWING RECOVERIES, BUT THE YIELD INVERSION WE ARE

01:37:28 SEEING RIGHT NOW IS NOT NORMAL. FROM THE FED FUNDS RATE TO THE

01:37:34 10-YEAR TREASURY YIELD, IT IS ONE OF THE LOWEST WE HAVE SEEN

01:37:35 IN DECADES. ASSUMING WE GET FED RATE CUTS

01:37:40 NOT BECAUSE OF RECESSION BUT FROM NORMALIZATION, EXPECT

01:37:44 SHORT-TERM YIELDS TO FALL MORE THAN LONG-TERM, AND SETTLING ON

01:37:46 THE 3.5 TO 4%. JONATHAN: APPRECIATE THE INSIGHT AND

01:37:51 REACTION FROM CHARLES SCHWAB, COLLIN MARTIN.

01:37:55 TWO-YEAR VERSUS 10-YEAR, NEGATIVE AT 32 BASIS POINTS.

01:37:56 LISA: BUT IT IS D INVERTED, CONSIDERING YOU HAVE SEEN BOTH

01:38:03 SIDES WITH SHORT-TERM YIELDS COMING IN FOR THE MOST PART

01:38:04 OVER THE PAST SIX MONTHS. JONATHAN: IF YOU LOOKED FOR THAT

01:38:08 AGGRESSIVENESS AND THE BIG RALLY AT THE BACK END OF

01:38:12 TERRIBLE DATA OR TREMENDOUS INFLATION DATA TO ENCOURAGE THE

01:38:13 FED TO START CUTTING INTEREST RATES, NOT SEEING IT. LISA:

01:38:17 PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE CYCLE, INCLUDING MYSELF.

01:38:21 WHAT THE FED REACTION WILL BE, AND HOW MUCH THEY WILL CUT, AS

01:38:23 WELL AS THE RISK PREMIA AND WHAT THEY WILL LOOK LIKE.

01:38:25 THIS IS ALL UNKNOWN. TERRITORY UNKNOWN. JONATHAN:

01:38:30 YOU ARE NOT ALONE, HARDLY ANYBODY UNDERSTANDS THIS CYCLE.

01:38:33 YIELDS COMING IN ABOUT THREE OR FOUR BASIS POINTS.

01:38:36 OVER THE NEXT HOUR, THE THIRD OF "BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE,"

01:38:45 DEUTSCHE BANK, ED MILLS, AND DAVID RUBENSTEIN JUST AROUND

01:38:54 THE CORNER.

01:39:02 >> THE FED IS SIGNALING TO US THAT THEY WILL BE PRUDENT ABOUT

01:39:03 NOT LOWERING RATES.

01:39:08 >> I THINK THE FED HAS MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE, THEY CAN VIEW

01:39:11 VOLATILITY WITH HAVING A LOT OF BULLETS LEFT IN THE GUN.

01:39:15 >> THE FED WILL NOT MAKE A DECISION BASED ON ONE DATA

01:39:17 POINT, THEY WILL TAKE THE TOTALITY OF IT AND LOOK AT IT

01:39:18 WHEN THEY DECIDE.

01:39:21 >> I THINK IT IS GOOD TO BE PATIENT UNTIL THEY ARE VERY

01:39:23 CONFIDENT THAT THINGS ARE HEADING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

01:39:26 >> WE ARE THINKING THAT THREE RATE CUTS IS WHAT WE GET.

01:39:31 >> THIS IS "BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE"

01:39:33 WITH JONATHAN FERRO, LISA ABRAMOWICZ, AND ANNMARIE

01:39:34 HORDERN. JONATHAN: THE THIRD HOUR OF "SURVEILLANCE"

01:39:39 BEGINS NOW. GOOD MORNING, GOOD MORNING.

01:39:46 THIS IS BLOOMBERG, ALONGSIDE LISA ABRAMOWICZ AND ANNMARIE

01:39:51 HORDERN DARLING, I AM JONATHAN FERRO. BIG LOSSES OF SMALL CAPS

01:39:55 YESTERDAY, DOWN 4%, UP BY SOMETHING LIKE 1%, AND EARLIER

01:39:59 THIS MORNING, THE HITS KEEP COMING, AND WE NEED TO TALK

01:40:01 ABOUT JOB CUTS, AND THIS TIME IT IS CONTINENTAL. LISA:

01:40:06 COMING OUT, IT WAS A GERMAN COMPANY CUTTING POSITIONS THAT

01:40:10 MAKES AUTO PARTS, AND IT IS TALKING ABOUT HOW IT CAN CUT

01:40:11 COSTS. PAUSE. WE HAVE BEEN HEARING AGAIN AND

01:40:16 AGAIN, JOB CUTS, AT A TIME WHEN RATES ARE INCREDIBLY --

01:40:21 UNEMPLOYMENT RATES ARE INCREDIBLY HIGH AND JOB

01:40:23 OPENINGS CAME IN HIGHER THAN EXPECTED.

01:40:25 I UNDERSTAND THIS IS IN GERMANY, NOT THE U.S., BUT WHAT

01:40:29 IS CORRECT, THE HEADLINES ARE NUMBERS?

01:40:32 HOW DO YOU SQUARE THE TWO? JONATHAN:

01:40:34 AND MANY COMPANIES STATESIDE ARE DOING THE SAME.

01:40:37 AND YOU LOOK AT JOBLESS CLAIMS, LOOKING AT 220, UP FROM 218,

01:40:42 UNEMPLOYMENT AT 4% FOR TWO YEARS, AND WE HAVE SEEN EXAMPLE

01:40:46 AFTER EXAMPLE AND SECTOR AFTER SECTOR. LISA:

01:40:51 UPSIDE SURPRISE AFTER UPSIDE SURPRISE, JOB CUT ANNOUNCEMENT

01:40:55 AFTER JOB CUT ANNOUNCEMENT, IN PARTICULAR FROM TECH COMPANIES.

01:40:56 HOW MESSY DOES IT BECOME TO UNDERSTAND JOB CUTS GIVEN THE

01:41:02 TURN HAVING TO -- CHURN HAVING TO DO WITH TECHNOLOGY,

01:41:08 DIFFERENT SKILL SETS, GIVEN THE CHURN THAT COMPANIES ARE

01:41:09 HOLDING OFF UNTIL THEY HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF THE STABILITY

01:41:10 OF THE ECONOMY? JONATHAN: AND IT MAKES COMMUNICATION IN

01:41:13 WASHINGTON HARDER. ANNMARIE: BECAUSE TO YOUR POINT,

01:41:20 UNEMPLOYMENT HAS BEEN UNDER 4% FOR TWO YEARS, AND WHY ARE WE

01:41:21 SEEING JOB CUTS? AND THEN INFLATION.

01:41:27 THIS IS THE ISSUE THAT HAS RATTLED THE PRESIDENCY.

01:41:30 WHEN YOU LOOK AT BASIC GOODS, FOOD GROWING UP, DINING,

01:41:35 ELECTRICITY BILLS, AND THE ONLY GEM IS THAT GAS PRICES ARE

01:41:37 GOING DOWN, THIS STARTS TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON CONSUMERS EVERY

01:41:39 SINGLE DAY. THEY GO TO THE GROCERY STORE.

01:41:43 THAT IS WHAT IS CONCERNING. YESTERDAY, THEY JUST TALKED

01:41:48 ABOUT SEASONALITY BECAUSE IT IS THE START OF THE NEW YEAR AND

01:41:51 THERE WILL BE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS, AND JANET YELLEN

01:41:53 SAID LOOK WHERE WE WERE AND WHERE WE ARE GOING.

01:41:56 SHE IS REALLY WEALTH TO COMMENT ON JUST ONE REPORT. JONATHAN:

01:42:00 THAT BOND MARKET IS SHAKING, TOO.

01:42:04 AND JANET YELLEN, IF THAT WAS A GOOD PRINCE, THEY WOULD BE

01:42:05 TALKING ALL DAY ABOUT IT. IF IT IS BAD, IT IS ONE DATA

01:42:10 POINT. IF IT DOESN'T FIT THE NARRATIVE, IT IS EASY TO NOT TO

01:42:12 DISCUSS IT. LISA: THAT IS OUR PEOPLE ARE PUSHING

01:42:17 BACK AND SAYING, YOU MAY NOT WANT TO CHALK THIS UP TO THAT

01:42:19 RIGHT NOW. JONATHAN: FIRST GOLDILOCKS.

01:42:25 ANY FURTHER SIGNS OF STICKINESS WITH DRINK ANOTHER WAVE OF

01:42:26 REVERSE GOLDILOCKS. WE GOT A WAVE OF THAT THROUGH

01:42:28 THE MARKET YESTERDAY. LISA: PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO PRICE AND

01:42:33 WHAT I KNOW LANDING EXPERIENCE LOOKS LIKE.

01:42:36 THIS IS A FUN GAME, NO LANDING, SOFT OR HARD LANDING. JONATHAN:

01:42:39 HOW MANY TIMES DID WE PLAY THIS LAST YEAR? LISA: LOTS OF TIMES.

01:42:43 JONATHAN: THIS TIME LAST YEAR, WE WERE AT

01:42:45 NO LANDING BEFORE THE HARD LANDING OF MARCH.

01:42:48 BEFORE THE BANKS FAILED. LISA: I WAS THINKING THAT SAME THING,

01:42:56 SO WE WENT FROM SOFT LANDING TO NO LANDING, AND WHAT IS NEXT?

01:42:57 WE SHOULD JUST SPIN A WHEEL. JONATHAN:

01:43:01 IT FEELS LIKE A RIDICULOUS GAME WITH NO PRIZES.

01:43:06 EQUITIES FOR THE S&P 500, POSITIVE BY 0.5%.

01:43:10 YIELDS LOWER BY TWO BASIS

01:43:16 POINTS, DR. .2966. -- 4.2966. THE NEXT HOUR, WE WILL TALK TO

01:43:20 DEUTSCHE BANK, ED MILLS, AND BLOOMBERG'S IRA JERSEY,

01:43:25 WEIGHING IN ON FED RATE CUT EXPECTATIONS AND CPI.

01:43:28 IT AGAIN WITH OUR TOP STORY, INFLATION CATCHING WALL STREET

01:43:29 OFF GUARD. DEEPAK PURI AT DEUTSCHE BANK

01:43:35 SAYING THAT THE STRONG CPI NUMBER, ALONG LAST WEEK'S JOBS

01:43:38 REPORT WILL REINFORCE THE FED'S VIEW THAT A CAUTIOUS APPROACH

01:43:43 WILL BE NEEDED AND EXPECTATIONS REMAIN THAT YOU WILL BE THE

01:43:44 MONTH WHERE THE FIRST CUTS WILL BE SEEN.

01:43:48 DEEPAK IS WITH US AROUND THE TABLE, GOOD TO SEE YOU.

01:43:51 WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN BETWEEN NOW AND JUNE TO MAKE THAT A

01:43:52 REALITY? DEEPAK: GREAT TO BE HERE.

01:43:56 THE FIRST THING THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IS WE NEED TO AVOID

01:44:00 GETTING THE PRINTS LIKE WE GOT YESTERDAY, BUT I THINK IF YOU

01:44:03 DIG DEEPER, IT IS REALLY THE LABOR MARKETS.

01:44:06 BUT IT IS NOT REALLY THE HEADLINE NUMBER OR EVEN THE

01:44:11 COURT NUMBER THAT -- CORE NUMBER THAT COULD BE INVESTOR

01:44:15 SENTIMENT, IT IS THE SERVICES SHELTER THAT REALLY DROVE THE

01:44:19 NARRATIVE OF THE DISINFLATION TRACTION NOT REALLY AS EMBEDDED

01:44:20 AS WHAT WE WERE EXPECTING. WHY IS THAT?

01:44:25 THAT IS DRIVEN BY CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY SPENDING.

01:44:31 EVEN THE MAIN MARKETS ARE SO TIGHT AND THERE WAS AN UPTICK

01:44:35 LAST TIME AROUND, IT IS HARD TO SEE HOW THE SUPER COURT CAN

01:44:38 COME DOWN TO A LEVEL THAT WOULD BE DIGESTIBLE FOR THE FED,

01:44:42 ESPECIALLY TALKING A LOT MORE ABOUT SUPER CORE AND THAT WOULD

01:44:47 BE THE CONDITION FOR A RATE CUT. SO WE HAVE TO SEE A COUPLE OF

01:44:49 THINGS. I AM PRETTY CERTAIN THAT THE

01:44:55 PHYSICAL INFLATION IS THERE, AND IT IS REALLY HONING DOWN TO

01:44:58 THE SUPER COURT INFLATION. JONATHAN:

01:45:02 ULTIMATELY, ABSENT THAT, WHAT IS THE VERY REAL RISK THAT

01:45:05 INFLATION STABILIZES ABOVE TARGET AND WHY IS THAT NOT YOUR

01:45:07 BASE CASE? DEEPAK: THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS

01:45:12 HAPPENING, JUST BECAUSE IT IS ONE DATA POINT, I DON'T THINK

01:45:17 THE DISINFLATION TRACK IS GOING TO GO AWAY ANYTIME SOON.

01:45:19 WHAT YESTERDAY'S NUMBER HAS TOLD US, WE SHOULD NOT COUNT ON

01:45:22 IT. IT WILL NOT BE A LINEAR SINGLE-LINE DECLINE ON THE

01:45:28 INFLATION FRONT, AND WE NEED TO BE PREPARED FOR THESE AB

01:45:31 DURATIONS IN THE MARKETS. ANYONE WHO WAS IN KEYNOTE THIS

01:45:37 GOLDILOCKS SCENARIO, I CONCERN NOW IS THAT THE GOLDILOCKS CAN

01:45:41 BE, YOU KNOW, CAN HURT ON BOTH SIDES AND INFLATION CAN START

01:45:43 TO READ ACCELERATE, WHICH WE SAW YESTERDAY, AND THE GROWTH

01:45:44 CAN START COMING DOWN. MARKETS PROBABLY ARE NOT PRICED

01:45:48 IN FOR THAT. LISA: RIGHT NOW, IT SEEMS PEOPLE WE

01:45:54 SPEAK TO IS SAYING THER ONLY SOLUTION IS TO BUY STOCKS.

01:45:57 YOU ARE LOOKING AT INFLATION THAT SEEMS TO BE STICKIER ON

01:46:00 THE HEELS OF GROWTH BUT DOES SEEM TO BE BETTER.

01:46:02 YOU AGREE OR IS THAT PREMATURE? DEEPAK: I THINK THE U.S.

01:46:09 STOCKS, ESPECIALLY THE BIG NAMES, GIVE U.S.

01:46:12 SOME COMFORT, WHETHER THERE WAS A COMFORT AND SIZE THAT STARTED

01:46:14 DURING THE PANDEMIC. I ALSO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE

01:46:20 MONEY SUPPLY, AND I WAS READING SOMETHING FROM MID-1990'S, YOU

01:46:27 KNOW, THE BYGONE ERA, TALKING ABOUT THE MONEY SUPPLY AND HOW

01:46:31 IT REALLY PROPEL THE STOCK MARKET, AND A YEAR LATER, THEY

01:46:36 TALKED ABOUT EXUBERANCE, SO MY CONCERN ON THE U.S.

01:46:38 STOCKS, ESPECIALLY THE BIG NAMES, IS THAT WE ARE REALLY

01:46:45 MAKING A LOT OF MONEY GOING INTO THOSE NAMES, ESPECIALLY

01:46:46 GIVEN THE PASSIVE NATURE OF THE MARKETS THAT WE ARE LIVING IN,

01:46:51 AND IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN AT 35 TIMES THE PE ON THE MAT SIX HOW

01:46:56 MUCH MORE COMFORT ONE CAN GET. WHAT WE ARE TELLING OUR CLIENTS

01:47:01 IS THAT A BETTER ENTRY POINT MAY COME YOUR WAY THIS YEAR, SO

01:47:06 RATHER -- SO NEW MONEY, STAY PUT AND DON'T START INVESTING.

01:47:07 LISA: YOU KICKED TESLA OUT, SO THAT

01:47:17 IS WHY IT IS THE MA SIXG --MAG SIX? DEEPAK: MAG SEVEN, SORRY.

01:47:21 LISA: I WAS JUST WONDERING. I KNOW IT WAS THE SUPER SIX OR

01:47:23 WHATEVER. JONATHAN: HOW MUCH FRAGMENTATION ARE YOU

01:47:27 SEEING IN THE BIG WINNERS OF LAST YEAR? DEEPAK:

01:47:31 WE ARE STARTING TO SEE IT ALREADY, THE NAMES THAT HAVE

01:47:34 DONE REALLY WELL ARE DOING REALLY WELL WITH BUYBACKS AND

01:47:36 THEY HAVE DONE REALLY WELL THIS YEAR.

01:47:44 AND THEN YOU SEE TESLA HAVING SOME ISSUES IN REGARDS TO THEIR

01:47:48 ABILITY TO HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF PROFITABILITY THAT THEY WERE

01:47:51 USING IT. THIS IS ALL WITH THE CAVEAT

01:47:52 THAT I AM NOT A FUNDAMENTAL ANALYST, SO -- JONATHAN: WE

01:47:57 SHOULD PROBABLY AVOID THIS CONVERSATION ENTIRELY THEN.

01:47:59 DEEPAK: MAYBE THAT IS A GOOD IDEA.

01:48:01 JONATHAN: BECAUSE IT IS NOT JUST TESLA

01:48:03 BUT APPLE, AS WELL. THERE ARE NAMES THAT ARE

01:48:07 STARTING TO UNDERPERFORM, UNLIKE TWO NAMES, META AND

01:48:10 NVIDIA. LISA: IS THIS THE BEGINNING OF A NEW

01:48:14 CYCLE WHERE THEY ARE LOOKING FOR SHARE BUYBACKS AND

01:48:16 DIVIDENDS OR A CERTAIN LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE
