00:12 The delicate dance of monetary policy, the fragility of the regional banking

00:16 sector. Live from studio to here at Bloomberg

00:18 headquarters in New York, I'm Romaine Bostick.

00:21 It's good to be back, by the way. Welcome back.

00:22 Houston was really fun, but not as fun as here.

00:24 So take that in stride. All right.

00:26 Let's get to the market here. S&P up just barely here, up 4/10 of 1%.

00:30 I got to say, Jay Powell didn't really do much to move the market.

00:33 You are getting a little bit of a bit into the bond market on the long end.

00:36 You got yields down by about four basis points on the ten year.

00:39 But I want to call it nothing burger because it was a something burger, but

00:42 it wasn't really tasty. BURGER Let's put it that way.

00:45 Gold, though, have are making no bones about it, continuing to grind higher

00:48 over 20 $100. And that really dovetails with Bitcoin's

00:51 also high and that's confusing. So isn't actually a risk on feel and the

00:56 dollar just a little bit weaker down 3/10 of 1%, the weaker currency in all

01:00 the G10 space. But Matt, I would say.

01:02 POWELL Matt, what do you think? Alix Steel is back and of course,

01:05 looking a gift horse in the mouth once again, Alex just got to take the rally

01:09 for what it is, maybe another potential record.

01:11 I not quite on the Nasdaq, which is trying to claw back those losses from

01:15 that two day sell off. But a big bounce off that 20 day moving

01:17 average, which is a somewhat encouraging sign that, yes, Alix Steel, there is

01:21 still life left in this rally after all. But Bloomberg strategist Ben Round, he

01:25 says beware of false prophets. The size and scope of the rally has

01:29 already exceeded several key historical benchmarks that would indicate a

01:32 reversal might be near. Now, he points out that when you look at

01:36 the aggregate market capitalization of the Nasdaq composite last week, that

01:40 briefly surpassed the 27 and a half trillion dollar size of the US economy

01:45 in total, that's the highest ever valuation investors have ever assigned

01:49 the tech sector outside of that pandemic induced rebound.

01:53 And while the setup into equity markets may still seem, well, a bit far from the

01:57 Bubblicious territory that people are concerned about, the macro outlook may

02:01 not be supportive of additional gains. That's according to UBS strategists.

02:05 Their call right now is largely around concerns about weakening productivity

02:09 worldwide. A pattern, if you remember, that spelled

02:12 the end of the bull run back in the 1990s.

02:15 Now, those strategists also say when you look at real disposable income growth,

02:19 that is weak and it will get weaker variables that need to start looking up

02:24 for that bull run to persist. We're going to get back to that story in

02:27 a second. But we got to start off with the big

02:29 story of the moment, and that is the drama surrounding the regional banks and

02:33 New York Community Bancorp and really the lagged effects of last year's

02:36 regional banking crisis, a 70 plus percent drop in the shares of New York

02:40 Community Bancorp over the last five weeks alone.

02:43 That drop apparently paused right now after a fund run by former Treasury

02:47 Secretary Steve Mnuchin. Alex rides in with a fresh injection of

02:51 capital. Yeah, you have to wonder, is this like a

02:52 private bailout in essence, at the end of the day or a private takeover?

02:56 We're like a little smidge left for regular shareholders.

02:58 This chart just is a says it. All right.

03:00 So here is LA last year and here is the turmoil in late January that moved down

03:05 in the stock. And this over here, this little a little

03:08 tick higher here doesn't really show the drama that has encapsulated the stock.

03:12 It's now trading just above $3. It was halted for trading in just about

03:15 about half an hour ago. It's whipping all over the place now.

03:18 It's trading at relatively flat levels. I guess the question is here, are we

03:22 done? Are we there yet?

03:23 Are there more shoes to drop? And then also trying to find out the why

03:26 behind this, Is it really just about a rent controlled issue for first or for

03:32 your community bank, or is it the regulation that's the problem and kind

03:35 of sussing that out as we go forward remain.

03:37 All right. Well, let's get some insights out of

03:38 Herman Chan, senior U.S. regional bank analyst over at Bloomberg

03:42 Intelligence. And I'll pick up on her last question

03:44 there, Herman, because we talk about the regulatory drama, but some of this might

03:49 have sort of been inadvertently self-inflicted.

03:51 Remember, they bought up some of those signature bank assets last year during

03:55 the original banking crisis. Was the purchase of those assets?

03:58 Did that kind of lead us to where we are today?

04:00 Yeah, it's a classic case of be careful what you wish for.

04:03 They wanted to be in the big leagues, really gain some market share within the

04:06 New York area, improve their commercial banking business with the signature

04:10 assets. But it does it flip them over the

04:13 hundred billion dollar asset market which introduced a lot more regulatory

04:16 scrutiny and now which now has forced them to cut their dividend and really

04:22 tanked the shares and required an equity injection as we've seen today.

04:25 So is it over now with the equity injection?

04:28 It's it's a lifeline. I'm not sure we're out of the woods

04:31 quite yet. We still don't know in terms of what

04:34 their deposits have reacted over the past month or so.

04:38 They unfortunately didn't give an update on their deposits with today's release.

04:43 So this gets to a weird question about what the ownership structure is Right

04:47 now. We're talking about a seven agents

04:49 Liberty strategic capital. They're putting up about $450 million.

04:53 Hudson Bay reference Capital, about 250 or so.

04:56 Right? A between the both of them and then a

04:58 few extra bucks coming in. That gets us to a $1 billion.

05:01 Who owns this company now? Right.

05:03 Effectively with the equity injection and also the warrants that that the

05:08 release noted, it seems to me that the investor group.

05:12 Effectively controls the bank at this juncture with existing shareholders

05:15 massively diluted. So you saw the the CEO is justified and

05:20 he is part of the investor group. He's now leading the charge on that

05:23 front. So it looks like they hold the cards.

05:26 All right. I'll be interesting.

05:27 And of course, we should point out still pending regulatory approval, but given

05:30 the circumstances, that shouldn't be too hard to come by.

05:32 Herman Chan, senior U.S. regional bank analyst at Bloomberg

05:35 Intelligence. As Alex would say in New York, Community

05:37 Bank Corp shares had been halted. They are reopening now up roughly about

05:41 4%. But an incredibly volatile session that

05:43 saw them down as much as 47% and up as much as 37.

05:48 Robert Stock and joining us right now, senior global economist over at Citi.

05:52 And Rob, I do want to get your take here on this because I thought the regional

05:55 banking crisis was over. What happened?

05:57 Yeah, this is a great question. Certainly what we're seeing is good news

06:00 for the market takes a risk out in that regional banking space.

06:04 But more broadly, I think we're in a very different place than we were, let's

06:09 say last spring. Last spring.

06:11 This was a new risk within the regional banking sector.

06:14 And you saw wild moves in markets as people tried to assess, you know, what

06:17 would be the spillover to the broader economy and financial stability.

06:20 I think we saw then it was concentrated in a few banks.

06:24 And I think we're seeing that now as well, that this issue is really

06:27 concentrated within New York Bancorp. And more broadly, we think that the

06:32 risks within commercial real estate are fairly modest.

06:35 When we look at the risk profile, it's really concentrated within office space

06:40 a little bit in multifamily, those office space loans that are riskiest or

06:44 maybe things they're like in New York City or urban areas and suburban banks,

06:49 loans are holding up much better, and those urban loans are more concentrated

06:54 in big lenders who put aside a fair amount of money to deal with bad loans

06:58 in the future. So we look at the risks here.

07:00 It really seems pretty modest from an economy wide perspective.

07:03 Do you expect that the testimony tomorrow in from the Senate for Jay

07:05 Powell to be any different based on that?

07:07 Like, I can't imagine that certain senators are going to appreciate

07:10 Manoogian coming in and in essence, scooping up the bank.

07:14 Yeah, And I think, you know, Powell is going to stick to a script that he stuck

07:18 to today, probably avoid getting too much into that issue and really say

07:22 something similar. I think to what I echoed is that the

07:25 regional banking stresses look fairly contained.

07:28 Powell talked about a bit of that recently, and then he'll pivot back to

07:32 more broader issues on the economy and financial stability risks which don't

07:37 look large from that sector. And the economy is holding up fairly

07:39 well. This may be a dumb question, but why

07:42 should I believe that it's contained? Not so much in the sense I know everyone

07:45 sort of looks back and they want to look for that sort of Lehman Bear Stearns

07:49 kind of contagion moment. I'm not saying we're going to do that,

07:52 but if we are looking at a regional banking sector that is hobbled and maybe

07:56 even those companies that are so healthy but maybe don't have the confidence to

07:59 extend lending, does that not have an economic impact?

08:01 Yeah, absolutely. And as you said, I mean, there are a lot

08:04 of aspects of this space that we don't have great visibility into.

08:07 So maybe we're just, you know, underestimating the unknown unknowns.

08:11 But I think it's telling that markets have taken it much more in stride in

08:15 terms of we haven't seen the spillovers to go to broader bank stocks or broader

08:20 equities or or the interest free market when these stresses emerge this time

08:24 around. And but more to your point, though, I

08:27 think the concern is that you're going to see a affect on credit and a

08:32 continued tightening in lending standards.

08:33 And we are seeing that if you look at the Fed Senior Law Office survey, you've

08:37 seen tightening in commercial real estate loans, but also all other types

08:39 of bank credit. The economy is held up impressively well

08:42 despite that tightening, but it is ongoing.

08:44 I love me this news. They're like one of my favorite

08:46 indicators, but I'm just like saying I do think it's a good time to come out of

08:51 me on that one. But it's interesting because it does

08:54 feel like and there was a great article in The Economist a long time ago about

08:57 this, that regulation begets the crisis. So you have a regulation that solving

09:01 for a crisis and then that regulation causes the problem to, you know, romance

09:04 point. The big tipping point was when they

09:07 scooped up assets and got over that threshold.

09:09 Do you think there's going to be a lot of pushback in terms of the regulatory

09:13 framework? And is that a good or bad thing?

09:14 Yeah, it's a great question. I think you saw some of that just more

09:17 broadly from Chair Powell today in his testimony that they are rethinking some

09:23 of the banking regulations that that have been proposed.

09:25 Now, that's more to do with the amount of capital that they expect larger banks

09:29 holds. But I do think there is a broader

09:31 rethink about some of these some of these thresholds and some of these

09:35 capital requirements. And we've seen a lot of stress and

09:38 movements within the banking sector in this cycle.

09:40 And I think that's going to feed into how policymakers are thinking about this

09:44 for years to come as they formulate kind of new banking policy.

09:47 This is why we definitely like taking Elizabeth Warren on the Senate Banking

09:51 Committee when she talks to Powell. All right.

09:52 Hey, Robert, thanks a lot. Robert Hocking, senior global economist

09:56 over at Citi. We really appreciate your time today.

09:59 But I think it does raise the question like if you just look at what happened

10:01 to, say, signature speed. Right.

10:03 The economy did really well after that. Yes.

10:04 Maybe the stocks tanked, maybe sentiment wasn't great, but the economy held up,

10:08 spending held up, incomes held up. Yeah, it did.

10:10 And it would have. They did not get that worst case

10:12 scenario, that contagion issue. But it raises a broader question,

10:15 though, as to did regulators do enough to really sort of shore up the regional

10:19 banking system, because that was always the takeaway, right?

10:21 It was kind of mission accomplished. They did what they needed to do.

10:24 They did what they needed to do. And here we are a year later, basically

10:27 on the one year anniversary and a few days of the ECB collapse.

10:30 And we're talking about another bank that needs to be effectively bailed out.

10:33 Right. But the regulation was what took them

10:35 over in the first place. Yeah.

10:36 Like if they hadn't lowered the bar, right, capital requirements, maybe it

10:39 would have been okay. The rent control property would still be

10:41 in bad. But we knew those laws change back in

10:43 2019. Well, why don't you think the government

10:45 gave them a little bit more of a leash, though?

10:46 I mean, knowing that they took on a burden that a lot of other people didn't

10:50 want to take on. And I just kind of make you wonder what

10:52 was going on behind the scenes, that they let them twist in the wind like

10:55 this. I don't know.

10:55 I mean, you see JPMorgan, like they were able to be like, yeah, we'll give you

10:58 that sweetheart deal because we really need you to bail me out here of four

11:01 assets from us, for example. But yeah, maybe not four, but maybe they

11:05 would have, I don't know, like, maybe they would have jumped in if a nation

11:08 hadn't gotten together. It'll be interesting to about the

11:10 ownership structure. I mean, the shares now reopening after

11:12 being halted once again, now up 10% at three and a half bucks here on a day

11:16 where it looked like they were headed to the wall.

11:19 They were below two bucks. A lot more.

11:21 All right. We're going to continue this

11:22 conversation and so much more. We want to get down to Washington, D.C.

11:25 right now where our balance of power co-hosts are standing by with the chair

11:28 of the SEC, Gary Gensler. Greetings to our TV and radio audiences

11:34 worldwide. I'm Joe Mathew alongside Kailey Leinz in

11:38 Washington DC and a pleasure to welcome the chair of the Securities and Exchange

11:43 Commission, Gary Gensler. Welcome back to our Washington bureau

11:46 here at Bloomberg. It's good to see you.

11:47 It's great to be with both of you. Looking forward to a conversation today

11:51 about the climate disclosure regulations that you're unveiling.

11:54 I have to ask you first about New York Bancorp with some of the drama that

11:57 we've seen over this past week amidst filing concerns about commercial real

12:02 estate fallout. Are you monitoring this?

12:03 Is there anything you can do to protect investors here?

12:07 Well, I think your viewers would understand that I'm in the role I'm in.

12:12 I'm not going to comment on any one registrant or filer, but many banks are

12:17 public companies. Those banks need to make sure that they

12:21 make full, fair and truthful disclosures to the public so that the public can

12:28 make their investment decisions. I know we're going to be talking about

12:30 climate, but it turns out it's connected.

12:32 They need to make those disclosures that investors take investment decisions so

12:39 on and make sure they have proper controls to make those disclosures.

12:44 And but I don't have anything more on this one, Frank.

12:48 But just broadly, you're not concerned about systemic risk that might be

12:51 emanating from commercial real estate? I again, I'm not going to comment on one

12:57 bank and so forth, but broadly speaking, broadly at the FCC, we are always

13:05 monitoring markets for systemic risk. And the reason is, is because investors

13:10 get harmed when one bank or one non-bank.

13:14 It could be a bank, it could be a hedge fund that fails and spills out into the

13:19 market. I've been kind of it's ain't my first

13:22 rodeo. I was even in the Clinton administration

13:25 when long term capital management failed.

13:27 I was an AA above administration when we were, you know, cleaning up after the

13:32 crisis. And it's always the American public,

13:35 both investors and issuers, that get hurt.

13:37 So at the SEC, we do monitor for systemic risk in our remit.

13:43 And then we work with Secretary Yellen and Chair Powell and share our thoughts.

13:48 So to return to this question of disclosures and this gets us to the news

13:51 out of the SEC today, you have adopted now climate disclosure rules that have

13:56 been significantly watered down from what was initially proposed.

13:59 Scope three has been removed for scope one and two companies are essentially

14:03 going to have to decide whether these climate risks are material.

14:07 To them. It's a pretty significant change.

14:09 Why not re propose it by just adopting it today rather than opening it back up

14:13 for comment? Have you opened the SEC up to more

14:15 scrutiny and potentially more litigation that could come from this?

14:18 Well, let's just step back for your viewers just for a moment.

14:22 What we have here is that today, literally hundreds, maybe a thousand

14:27 companies already today are making information about climate

14:32 risk available to their investors. They're often doing it on the Internet,

14:37 their sustainability reports and so forth.

14:40 What we did today is we adopted a rule. We hadn't had a rule previously, and we

14:47 said, yes, these disclosures need to be in your filings, in your annual reports,

14:53 in your registration statements, if material that's consistent with five,

14:58 seven decades of what we do, materiality is the benchmark.

15:02 It's investors get to make the investment decision based upon the

15:06 material disclosures. In this case, climate risk is something

15:11 investors want to know about. Hundreds of companies are already making

15:17 such information available, but this will give it more reliability.

15:23 What's the cost involved here for companies that will be new to these

15:27 disclosures? Typically, critics point to red tape

15:30 beyond the politics here, red tape and increased costs.

15:32 You actually have a sense of this already for those that are disclosing.

15:37 And I suspect from the comments that you received, particularly companies that

15:40 are just making the threshold and now you have carve outs for some smaller

15:44 publicly traded companies. But what would be the additional cost of

15:47 this due diligence? Could you put a number on it?

15:49 So so we we lay this all out in this release.

15:53 It's over 800 pages if you want to have some weekend reading.

15:58 But we really based a cost estimates on what commenters had given us and us, We

16:03 got some very we got 24,000 comments on this.

16:07 And in terms it depends on the issuer. If an issuer actually determined that

16:14 it's not material to their investors, the cost would be

16:20 probably quite low. But if they determine that, for

16:23 instance, to inform their investors properly that

16:28 greenhouse gas emissions are met. Terrible.

16:31 Then the costs go up. But but again, in the release, it was

16:35 measured from a couple hundred thousand per issuer to I think upwards to high

16:41 six figures, but still in the six figure range per issuer.

16:45 But leaving it up to the issuer to decide whether this is material, could

16:48 this actually result in less disclosure around climate related risks, not more,

16:54 to avoid incurring some of those compliance costs?

16:57 Well, what's interesting is if you look at the Russell 1000, the top thousand

17:00 companies, some surveys show that already 90% talk about climate somewhere

17:06 climate risk, and about 60% put out something about these so-called

17:11 greenhouse gas emissions. And they're already doing it because

17:17 investors want to get that information. But again, our history, our remit is

17:23 about that, which is material for investors.

17:26 And that's that's what we're doing here. And we're we're climate risk agnostic.

17:33 And if if if more companies make this disclosure or fewer make the disclosure,

17:39 it's about materiality. But I would say what we did today is

17:43 important because it will bring some consistency and it's a real role.

17:48 Kelly referenced the potential for legal action here.

17:51 I suspect that it's part of our democracy some time into this.

17:54 Indeed, and obviously legal challenges are already being planned.

17:58 There are nine states being led by West Virginia at this point we've heard

18:01 about. But I wonder when you consider this and

18:03 you've been down this road before, is it governments?

18:06 Is it corporations? Is it environmentalists who will bring

18:11 the legal challenges to the SEC? Here it is, all of them.

18:14 I again, I think that at the FCC, we endeavor to do things within the law and

18:20 how the courts interpret the law. And so we take the economics into

18:24 consideration. We take these 24,000 comments into

18:26 consideration. And of course, we take in another law.

18:31 It's not the securities law called the Administrative Procedures Act.

18:34 You know how we do rule writing. I feel quite

18:39 confident that we've done something within the congressional mandate.

18:43 And why is that? It's because we're a disclosure agency

18:47 and that's all we're doing here. Companies already thousand plus

18:52 companies are already. Putting out some climate risk

18:56 information. Investors are already making decisions

19:00 and we're saying grounded in materiality.

19:02 Put it in your filings and be consistent with what you're doing.

19:08 On the subject of consistency, though, if you're a big multinational company,

19:12 the SCC rules are now what they are. California's rules.

19:15 Europe's rules are significantly stricter.

19:18 How is this supposed to work if you have to answer to multiple jurisdictions?

19:22 KELLY It's a very good question. They have different

19:26 authorities. We're a securities regulator in Europe,

19:29 passes a law through their European Parliament that had a goal to manage the

19:34 environment. California similarly through their

19:37 legislation. That's not what we do.

19:40 We stay within our we stay within our chalk lines, if I can use tennis,

19:48 staying within the chalk lines, despite conversations that you're having today

19:53 around climate risk, you also, I'm sure, as a five member commission and as the

19:58 staff are going to be considering in recent months, because you are facing a

20:01 deadline coming up in May around a spot Etherium ETF having a it is Kelly you

20:07 had to go you have to question this question.

20:10 Of course we are now about two months into a world in which spot Bitcoin

20:13 products exist. They have had incredible demand, more

20:16 than $8 billion in inflows. Now the optimism is ether spot ETFs are

20:20 next. Do you not?

20:21 First have to settle the question as to whether ether is a security or a

20:24 commodity? Can you answer that first?

20:27 Well, Kelly, again, on any one of these crypto tokens is about the facts and

20:33 circumstances as to whether the investing public is anticipating a

20:38 profit based on the efforts of others. But we do have filings in front of us.

20:43 I'm not going to comment. I will say this.

20:46 This is a highly speculative asset class.

20:49 One could just look at the volatility of Bitcoin in the last few days.

20:53 And look, I grew up loving roller coasters.

20:57 Maybe in my adult years I don't ride them as much.

20:59 But you really should be conscious as the investing public that this is a bit

21:04 of a roller coaster ride on these volatile assets.

21:09 And then the question is, is how how firm is the foundation of that?

21:14 You know, you get to the top of that hill.

21:16 How is the foundation underneath it? Nor are their cash flows or what's the

21:20 use case for thousands of these tokens? There's about 15 or 20,000 of them.

21:27 They also may be securities because the investing public is relying on the

21:33 efforts of some group of entrepreneurs in the middle of these products.

21:37 Would you consider ether as part of that group that may be securities?

21:40 I understand you're asking the question, but again, I'm going to defer on that

21:45 QUESTION. All right.

21:46 SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, thank you so much, as always, for giving Bloomberg

21:49 Television and radio your time and we'll send it back to you.

21:54 All right. Thanks so much, guys.

21:55 That is FCC chair Gary Gensler with Kailey Leinz and Joe Mathews really

21:59 trying to Asma does either. ETFs do not want to bite.

22:03 Yeah, I mean, look, I mean, he laid out his strategy or at least articulated

22:07 what he thinks is a strategy. I'm not sure that the market interprets

22:09 it the same way. I am not trying to sell shade.

22:12 I mean, it is what it is. Yeah, you know, that's what happens.

22:14 And regulation is so far behind. Yeah, but, but it's been a while.

22:18 I mean, he came in, he looks like he was ready to run through the wall and, you

22:21 know, it's been, you know what, three over the almost four years coming on the

22:24 four year mark is this was not SCC problem but isn't the problem like with

22:27 I too it's like yeah it's a little too far ahead of regulation.

22:31 You need good regulation to move forward.

22:33 But the flipside is going to take. Yeah the problem isn't what they the

22:35 problem isn't with either a bitcoin. The problem is with Washington.

22:38 Oh, it feels like it's now maybe you can use A.I.

22:41 to fix Washington. How about that rollout inefficiencies

22:44 and work productivity? What we won't even look like, right?

22:47 Oh, I don't know. We're more than we can handle.

22:49 This is the close. I'm Bloomberg.

22:55 And.

23:09 I one of the top read stories in the terminal today, and it's a doozy.

23:12 Acne products from several brands like Proactiv, Target and Clinique are

23:16 alleged to contain elevated levels of benzene.

23:19 That's a chemical linked to cancer. And this is according to Bloomberg

23:22 Reporting and basically a reporting watchdog area called Balancer.

23:28 I'm going to pretend like I said that. Right.

23:29 So Balancer does all this stuff on on on consumer goods to make sure they're

23:33 safe. And they came across this is basically

23:36 when you have ingredients in acne cream to sit in hot areas or hot weather for a

23:41 long time. I'm talking like really hot shower hot.

23:44 They liquefy. And that's the ingredient that can cause

23:47 cancer. Right.

23:48 So this is like the benzoyl peroxide, which ended up so safe, but it turns

23:53 into benzene. If you keep it in the trunk of your car

23:55 in the middle of the summer, like I do, and also look nice, which everyone does.

23:58 But what which is interesting, too, is that you can also inhale it.

24:01 So even if you're not putting it on your face, it can come out of the tube and

24:05 you can inhale it, which is also very dangerous.

24:07 Oh, is it? Okay.

24:08 That I did not know. This is a serious issue.

24:10 And I think there's a reason why. It's basically the second most read

24:12 story of the day on the Bloomberg. I think we all have some connection to

24:16 this, whether it's in our past life or with our current children and things

24:20 like that. So it's concerning.

24:21 You know, the first thing I did, like everyone else, is you start going

24:24 through the the the cabinet in the bathroom and looking at the ingredients.

24:27 I was like, what do I give my daughter? Yes, you know, we're safe, but 100%.

24:31 But and you look at some of the stocks, though, so Target is not really reacting

24:34 here. But you have terror pharmaceutical.

24:36 You have say Lauder, you have record bank bed cancer over in Europe, they

24:40 closed lower as well. They all have these kind of products and

24:43 that material lower today. Yeah, And it gives it raises the whole

24:45 question of liability and whether this becomes one of those cases that winds

24:49 its way through the system for like, you know, a gazillion years.

24:51 Yeah, pretty much good times. All right.

24:52 Well, coming up, it's a path to net zero, maybe pay with carbon offsets.

24:56 Something is a dirty word. Some like it like Tom Montag.

24:58 My conversation with him next. This is Bloomberg

25:01 and.

25:17 Just about 3 p.m. here in a rainy New York.

25:19 This is the countdown to the close. I'm Romaine Bostick and I'm Alix Steel.

25:23 So some breaking news for you concerning Xcel Energy and the fire in Texas in the

25:27 Panhandle. So apparently a toppled utility pole

25:30 that Excell has been told to preserve as potential evidence was inspected and

25:36 marked with a quote, Do not climb symbol before the start of the fire.

25:41 We're looking at of photos that were shared by a landowner whose ranch burned

25:44 in the blaze that showed a downed pole wrapped in evidence tape sporting a

25:48 silver inspection tag and a red metal caution tag.

25:51 And I should point out, remain that stock is down.

25:53 Actually, it's flat right now. But at one point it hit the lowest level

25:56 since March of 2020. It does take a long time sometimes to

25:59 find the cause of a fire. But we saw it with PGD.

26:01 We saw it on Hawaiian electric utility poles and on say, poles that just can't

26:06 get fixed can be a cause of fire. Yeah, absolutely.

26:09 And this now opens up the litigation phase of this at the potential

26:12 litigation phase of this, even though we still have not determined exactly what

26:15 the cause was. All right.

26:16 Well, we're watching that saga as we head into the close.

26:18 Earlier this week, I did attend BNF a Barrel of Tomorrow forum in Houston that

26:23 was all about energy transition, technology and innovation.

26:27 It does dovetail the FCC conversation with the Excel conversation.

26:30 And in that, I caught up with the Rubicon Carbon CEO Tom Montag, and he

26:34 told me his company aims to be the quote, the BlackRock of carbon credit.

26:37 So basically your company, you can go to him and buy a suite of carbon credits.

26:41 And I asked him about the importance of this voluntary carbon offset market.

26:46 I'll tell you a story that I read in the paper, and I assume it's true because I

26:49 read in the paper and it was about Lego. And Lego had been trying to fix their

26:55 bricks so they didn't have a carbon footprint.

26:57 And they did all this work around it and they couldn't get them right.

26:59 They thought they had the right thing and they tried 200 different types of

27:03 materials and they were using recycled and then they realized the recycling and

27:06 all that was using actually more carbon than that.

27:08 And they just were going back to the brick.

27:10 And here's and I use that analogy because it's a toy company and they make

27:15 something that kids love and I even use, but they just can't find the way to make

27:19 it that way. But they're willing to invest the money

27:21 in the time. And if your journey takes you someplace

27:23 where it feels impossible to make that, it'd be great if you could offset what

27:28 you were doing. If you're in setting process doesn't get

27:31 you there. And I think most companies would tell

27:33 you that they don't think their inserting properties get them there

27:37 eventually. Even today on the panel, one of the

27:40 participants said, We feel that we're going to need to have offsets in ten

27:45 years or something like that. We have plenty to do now, but to really

27:47 get there, we're going to need offsets to finish the journey.

27:50 And that's why this is so interesting that Rubicon is you have all of it

27:53 right. You have the Wall Street investment

27:54 experience and you have a trading part and then there's a scientist part having

27:58 them all together. Like that's what you're trying to

28:00 create, like a measurable liquid. Legit.

28:04 Voluntary carbon market. Yes.

28:06 How hard is that part? Part.

28:08 Okay. What's the hardest part?

28:09 Well, the hard part is that there's been so much about it that saying how the

28:13 wrong the bad things about it, the bad. And it's like saying if if somebody

28:16 always was like, oh, this stock's bad, that stock bad.

28:19 People wouldn't like the stock market so much as people saying, Oh, this stock's

28:22 good, that stock's good, this stock is good.

28:24 And so there's just been this narrative around a market that, by the way, is

28:28 confusing, because if you look at the name of a project, you don't know what

28:31 it is. You don't know you don't know exactly

28:33 who approved that when, what standards it was under, at what time does anybody

28:37 really audit it. And so it is a voluntary market that

28:40 doesn't that hasn't matured yet to the point of a financial market re mature.

28:44 So it's difficult because people don't want to get caught up in in something

28:48 that turned out to be not so good. And that brings to like two parts.

28:52 One is you got to have the supply of the stuff and then you got to have the

28:55 buyers of the stuff. Let's go to the buyers first.

28:57 You know who's buying these carbon offsets today and how do you expand

29:01 that? Well, we're trying to expand it and we

29:04 try to expand it by giving them a diversified portfolio from a credible

29:09 source, which is us that owns these things with a science team that looks at

29:14 them and opines on the credibility of those.

29:18 And we also offer a risk adjustment process.

29:21 So we say, listen, all these projects have some leakage or something that

29:26 doesn't make them be 100, most of them. And so it might be 1%, but it might be a

29:31 lot, as you can see in the Guardian article.

29:33 So the idea if you want a risk adjustment, we are science people risk

29:36 adjusted. So we believe we're selling you a ton as

29:39 a ton. So you do Wall Street stuff, which we do

29:41 Well, it was one of the first thing I brought up was like, we should do risk

29:44 adjustment. It was like kind of securitization.

29:45 Like the scientists are like, what? Well, you have a scientist said, This is

29:48 not good. Oh, this project, we don't think it's so

29:50 good. What do you mean by not good?

29:52 And let's just say, look, let's say they said, Oh, I think it's 80% of what they

29:56 said. I go, Oh, because on Wall Street

29:58 there'll be a bond that might be supposed to be 100.

30:00 It's at 80, but people are buying it because I think the 80 actually could be

30:04 90 like so there's still value there. It might not be 100, but there's value

30:09 there. And we need to see all the value on

30:11 these things and support them so they can achieve whatever value they can.

30:15 And so that's how we came up with the risk adjustment.

30:18 What kind of companies are buying the credits right now?

30:20 Well, you see most of them in the press. You see mostly people.

30:24 Well, not a lot. So if you look at it in the market last

30:28 year, if you look at retirements in America, just the public retirements of

30:32 offsets, 90% of them were done by 80 companies.

30:37 In other words, thousands of companies that did small amounts, but real volume

30:42 was in the United States. And again, this is private.

30:44 People do retired public privately and publicly.

30:47 Privately. We don't really know.

30:49 Publicly, we do know. And that's like 90 to 100 companies and,

30:52 you know, some of them by just in the press.

30:55 So it's like oil and gas companies and tech companies, Right?

30:57 I mean, and some service companies. And that is basically high margin

31:02 companies. Right.

31:02 That can afford to do that. Yes.

31:04 How do you get lower margin companies like a chemical company or a refiner or

31:09 something that needs to do it right, but they can't afford it.

31:12 Right. Well, there you have to find you try to

31:15 develop good projects that meet their price point.

31:18 You know, the the Bloomberg and F was where we are now.

31:21 There's a lot of great research on the emissions of companies and the margins

31:26 of those companies. And a lot of the big emitters are very

31:28 low margin businesses. So they can afford to do these very

31:31 expensive carbon removal projects. And so we're trying to work with them

31:35 and develop projects that they can do that meet their qualifications.

31:38 And it takes some time. Yeah,

31:41 that was me to be with Tom Montag Rubicon Carbon Services CEO.

31:45 Or maybe what's so interesting? Not only is this is a second career for

31:48 the Wall Street guy, Tom Montag is voluntary carbon credits like number one

31:52 and number two. Credits are really a dirty word in the

31:55 industry, no pun intended. Vacation issue.

31:57 There's a there's. Can you really trust them?

32:00 There's lots of different problems. And he's genuinely trying to use Wall

32:02 Street to fix that. I mean, I'm always really down for any

32:06 sort of financialization that sort of creates incentives to sort of address a

32:10 lot of the social issues like climate change.

32:12 But it raises the question, are these credits, are they having a meaningful

32:16 impact? And I think that that's what the science

32:17 team is desperately trying to do. And I found interesting because he was

32:20 like, well, you can take a project, maybe 80% of it's good and ten or 20% is

32:24 bad y throughout the whole thing. Can we just basically securitize it,

32:28 which is something that hasn't been done before within the market.

32:31 And again, but again, a lot of companies won't go anywhere near carbon offsets

32:36 because of that exact issue and there's no transparency with the price.

32:39 So getting a price together is very tricky.

32:41 Gosh, yeah, I remember we were supposed to have that transparency.

32:43 There were supposed to be a whole market that would be there and we could all

32:46 just just like we look on our Bloomberg terminals and see all the prices and

32:49 that never really materialize, I think in theory.

32:51 And I feel like that was intentional like 80 years ago.

32:53 I mean, fast forward 80 years ago, you and I won't be here, but someone else

32:56 will be. Maybe there will be a function on the

32:57 terminal, but it's very hard to come to a price.

33:00 Otherwise, he's very horrified that he would be angry.

33:03 And do you know something? I don't the awkward.

33:05 I'm so sorry. I guess I've been watching the robot.

33:07 I remember watching so many sci fi movies.

33:09 I thought I could just freeze my head and I could come back and haunt

33:12 everyone. You're gonna be all right.

33:15 All right. Coming up here, a closer look at the

33:16 markets trying to rebound from the big losses of the past two days.

33:19 And a big rebound right now for New York Community Bancorp.

33:22 Big swings in that stock for the troubled commercial real estate lender,

33:25 but a lifeline from Steve Mnuchin, his fine ponying up about $450 million,

33:30 leading our effort overall to inject about $1 billion in equity capital.

33:34 That conversation coming up next. Is it the clothes on the Bloomberg?

33:50 It's the world's second largest economy with a growing influence in global

33:54 affairs. But geopolitical uncertainties,

33:57 deflationary pressures and questions about foreign investment linger.

34:01 Bloomberg The China show brings you the unmatched expertise you need to keep

34:05 track of breaking news, in-depth market analysis, and the most influential news

34:09 makers in and around China. Bloomberg Good China show now weekdays

34:14 at 9 a.m. Hong Kong time right here on Bloomberg.

34:17 Context changes everything.

34:30 Time now for our Stock of the Hour. And for the third time in less than a

34:33 week, we are taking a closer look at New York Community Bancorp.

34:36 It is not the biggest gainer out there, but it is certainly the most volatile

34:40 right now, up about 3% after multiple halts here on the day.

34:43 The lesson that we learned today here is, yes, there is a lifeline and it's

34:47 going to come in the form of private capital.

34:49 Abigail Doolittle Joining us right now to talk a little bit more about this

34:52 story Steve mentioned, leading off basically a $1 billion capital injection

34:56 here for this company that's moving. This stock is having an effect on other

35:00 regional lenders as well. A huge effect.

35:02 In fact, the headlines in terms of New York Community Bank before this headline

35:06 around the equity raise that they needed equity that took the CRE or the

35:11 community bank regional bank ETF down sharply.

35:14 It was down more than 2%. What really stood at that time, out of

35:17 140 members, only four were higher. So we did have at that time NYC be down

35:22 45%, but a lot of the other stocks were down four or 5%.

35:25 But as we've been talking about in recent days, because this has been such

35:28 a story, the true contagion is probably less likely to be material because the

35:33 25 biggest regional banks, they don't have so much exposure, exposure to

35:37 commercial bank. They have a lot of liquidity.

35:38 The smaller ones, yes, there's going to be some blow up.

35:41 But it's interesting, I was speaking to a long term veteran yesterday in the

35:44 regional banking space, and he doesn't think that this is going to be like the

35:47 SNL crisis. He thinks he doesn't think that there

35:49 can be thousands or even dozens of banks affected.

35:51 He thinks maybe a dozen or so. So relatively unknown fundamental

35:55 standpoint, it seems more likely to be contained.

35:58 And yet, from a stock perspective, stocks really reacting to the headlines.

36:01 Now, we have if we take a look at the CRE, it's actually down ever so

36:05 slightly. It had moved higher on the news and

36:07 headlines, but we do have the bulk of this and we had the bulk of the stocks

36:11 after that diminution equity raise rescue up.

36:15 Right now, it's about a little bit more down.

36:18 Right. I mean also run on the bank is different

36:20 than like what they're going to get. That's the whole deposit.

36:22 What am I talking about? Right.

36:24 Like, we have to see what their deposit base looks like before you draw any

36:26 conclusion on that. Yes.

36:28 Now, obviously, the Fed is an oversee like overall bank regulation.

36:31 And Powell did comment on bank regulation today.

36:33 What do we learn about that? Yeah, it's really interesting.

36:35 So Fed Chair Jay Powell did comment before Congress in terms of Basel three,

36:40 the endgame, the idea that US banks, the big banks may need to see more

36:44 regulation, that they may need to raise capital by about 19% or so to bring more

36:49 in standard with some of the other banks around the world.

36:52 And that also other tougher regulations will need to be put in place.

36:55 Now, tomorrow, this could come up again. And of course, Senator Elizabeth Warren

36:58 could make it pretty exciting, as there could be some fireworks, as apparently

37:03 she is very supportive of this. There's going to be a period of time for

37:06 commentary from the public. But the bottom line is it does seem like

37:10 the capital requirements for the big banks at some point, we don't know the

37:13 exact timeline are going to be raised. But to your point, they do not the Fed

37:17 does not regulator Basel three, the regional banks.

37:19 So a little bit of a separate animal. But it is interesting just to think that

37:22 more regulation could be put into place. All right, Abigail, thanks so much.

37:25 Really appreciate. I do think that this made tomorrow much

37:28 more interesting with the Senate Banking Committee and Powell.

37:31 Usually it's like a snooze fest, a repeat of the second week.

37:34 Do not think I think this will make it much.

37:36 And today was kind of a snooze fest because we didn't have that news then.

37:39 But of course, that's going to be the big topic of conversation.

37:41 Why wasn't this resolved? Alix Steel What?

37:43 I mean, the whole regional banking crisis, I don't know.

37:45 I'm not in charge, but I was in charge. Obviously be resolved.

37:47 They told me you were in charge with. I am misinformed.

37:51 Yeah. All right.

37:52 Coming up, we're going to get you down to the Closing Bells as their online

37:54 partner and chief market strategist over at Alpine Saxon Woods will be joining us

37:58 for her take. This is a close on Bloomberg.

38:06 And.

38:21 This is the countdown to the close. Romaine Bostick alongside Alix Steel and

38:25 a lot of concern yesterday, alex, with the market hitting some interesting lows

38:29 and testing a lot of those key technical levels to the downside.

38:32 But it looks like some of those technical levels maybe provided a little

38:35 bit of support. You know, it's like it's like you need a

38:37 reason to sell a a reason to buy anymore.

38:39 I feel like the narrative is kind of switched.

38:41 You're looking at the S&P up four or 5/10 of 1% tech, the second best

38:44 performing sector. Within that.

38:46 I do also want to highlight gold and bitcoin also doing really well.

38:50 The KBW bank index is really not but well off the lows at the New York

38:54 community. Banker news came out earlier today.

38:56 Yeah a big story here and all week that well we're going to see a few catalysts

39:00 Of course we had the big jobs report at the end of the week, a State of the

39:03 Union speech by the president tomorrow, and Jay Powell on Capitol Hill for two

39:07 straight days of testimony. Day one was today, and he largely stuck

39:10 to the script, signaling that the strong U.S.

39:12 economy will keep officials on hold. For now,

39:16 we believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening

39:20 cycle. We want to see a little bit more data so

39:22 that we can become confident and so that we can take that step of beginning to

39:27 reduce policy rates. Committee does not expect that it will

39:29 be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater

39:33 confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%.

39:37 When we reach that confidence, the expectation is we will do so sometime

39:40 this year. We can then begin dialing back the

39:43 restriction on our policy. If the economy evolves broadly as

39:46 expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint

39:51 at some point this year. Jay Powell there in Washington.

39:55 Here in Studio two in New York is Sara Hunt, partner and chief market

39:58 strategist over at Alpine Sax. And was Elvis countdown to the closing

40:01 bell? And I had a chuckle watching that.

40:03 I mean, we had the little banner that said Jay Powell speaking earlier.

40:06 I figured, like, you've got to put any date of his testimony from any of the

40:09 past testimonies in the last couple of years, and it would have been the same

40:12 quotes here, a consistent message. Are people finally buying it?

40:15 Well, I think that, you know, the one thing you want to do is not say

40:19 something that everybody goes, oh, my goodness, I can't believe what they just

40:21 said. Right.

40:22 So this is this is this is one of those opportunities where you reinforce what's

40:26 been said and you try to make sure that anything that was off piece gets back

40:30 into the fold. Right.

40:31 So I think that's I think that was today's.

40:34 Were you expecting more not so much out of this particular testimony, but about

40:38 the communication we're going to get out of the Fed heading into a meeting that's

40:41 still, what, a week and a half or so away with regard to whether they're

40:45 going to communicate to this market, not just will they cut rates, but give them

40:49 a better timetable as to when those rate cuts will come?

40:52 That has been the question. All right.

40:53 Because in the beginning of this year, we had a whole bunch of rate cuts priced

40:58 into the market. Then they started coming off the table.

41:00 Then the question is, when are we going to start?

41:01 Are we going to turn maybe we're going to start in June.

41:03 And now the question is, are we going to start?

41:05 If the economic data continues to stay strong, it's going to be hard to say.

41:09 We have to cut rates for any reason. I think the market likes the economic

41:12 data staying strong. And as long as inflation remains at

41:15 somewhat at least quiescent and doesn't get worse, then I think that you've got

41:19 a reasonable equity path, you know, and the existence variables otherwise, which

41:23 was the question I was asking before, like I feel like the question now is

41:26 like, when do you sell? Like not when you buy, right?

41:29 I mean, it feels like we're buying the dip.

41:31 Like this is the thing, like we're supportive of equities.

41:33 Like when do you sell equities? Now,

41:36 that's a tough question, too, because what's going on right now in the

41:39 backdrop is you've got the earnings coming through, which is why which is

41:42 where I think that you got the first quarter the last couple of months, the

41:46 market was acting much better. People expected the beginning of the

41:48 year. You might see a pullback because what if

41:51 something didn't go well? The story's continuing to play out.

41:54 People are talking about productivity in the right kind of ways.

41:57 Most of the things seem to be going pretty well, so there's no real catalyst

42:01 for that except that there is a lot of other things.

42:04 We've got an election coming. There's still problems going on in the

42:07 Middle East. You could see as in oil prices creep

42:10 back up, that leads to inflation. That's going to make people concerned

42:13 because if the Fed can't cut rates at all this year or starts to push that

42:16 out, I think the market starts to get a little more volatile on the back of

42:20 that. So I'm looking now at a comp chart on a

42:23 normalized basis and Nasdaq 100 and Apple back for the last five years.

42:27 I don't think we've ever seen this kind of disconnect with the Nasdaq 100 and

42:31 Apple now trading at 169. And I wonder at what point does Apple

42:36 give Tech the signal to sell or is Apple idiosyncratic thing at this point?

42:40 Is it a China store? Is it totally different now?

42:42 So I think the reason that that it can be OC, as it were, that divergence is

42:46 because you can spin each of the divergences four as a problem of their

42:50 own making or not their own making of their own industry.

42:53 Right? So for Tesla, it's you've got a slowdown

42:55 in EVs. For Apple, you've got specific issues in

42:57 China and there's just always concern about Apple without the next greatest

43:01 thing, what's going to happen. Meanwhile, they're building more support

43:04 services, revenue and everything else, but they're not in any kind of financial

43:08 trouble. So the stocks that are doing well, which

43:11 are the ones that are working on that I framework on the on the Microsofts and

43:14 on Nvidia, those are continuing to do well and the demand is still there.

43:18 So that. Allows people to justify saying, okay,

43:22 it doesn't matter that some of the Magnificent Seven are not acting as well

43:26 as they did last year because we have a chunk of them that are.

43:29 But what do you when you look at the market in aggregate and you look at

43:32 valuations and I know everyone has their own sort of historical metric that they

43:36 want to cherry pick to show whether the market's either undervalued or

43:39 overvalued. But there has been a lot of hay here as

43:42 to just how much tech stocks now sort of comprise in terms of market cap, sort of

43:46 rivaling the size of the US economy. And a lot of concerns here that, you

43:50 know, the lack of growth. Yeah, sure, these companies aren't in

43:52 trouble, but that growth that everyone got so dependent on, investors got so

43:56 dependent on that appears to be, if not gone, certainly waning in some of the

44:00 stocks. It is.

44:01 And I think that that's why you're seeing Apple diverge so much right now

44:04 from the Nasdaq. And that's been the big concern on some

44:06 of the companies where that growth has slowed down as opposed to others where

44:10 that growth is either accelerating or you can see a reason why you could

44:13 imagine it will accelerate in the future.

44:15 And I think, you know, Apple's made some interesting moves, pulling back from the

44:19 car and looking to focus in other ways, tells you that they're looking at their

44:23 own portfolio and saying how what is the next place for us to grow?

44:26 So I think people will hang their hats on on growth that could come because

44:30 they're just such cash generating machines.

44:32 And it's the companies that don't generate cash that have lofty valuations

44:36 that are more tricky. Yep.

44:38 Than than anything else. But the ones that are generating so much

44:40 cash, it's hard it's hard not to take that cash generation as something that

44:45 has a value. So I'm a dividend guy.

44:47 I make money, but I'm value. That's why I'm a dividend guy when you

44:51 buy me. Well, there's a difference between

44:54 value, the dividend value trade and the companies that are adding dividends on a

44:58 growth profile, because I think that that's change to capital allocation has

45:01 changed. We look a lot of capital allocators.

45:03 We look at people who are both increasing their dividends and or buying

45:06 back their stocks. And to the extent that that you need to

45:10 grow and have cash flow that allows you to do that, you can't do that in a

45:13 vacuum. You can't just be stuck at the same

45:15 dividend level forever because then you're something like a value trap to

45:19 some extent. And right now the market is not value,

45:22 not not putting much of a value on that to be cute with my words, but you know

45:27 what I mean? So I think that there's what you're

45:29 looking for is somebody who can grow that dividend, even if the yield isn't

45:32 fantastic right now. Can I grow it?

45:33 Am I using my own cash generating, either buy my stock back or to increase

45:38 that? All right, Sara, always great to see

45:40 you. Sarah Hunt, partner and chief market

45:41 strategist at Alpine, Saks. And words helping us countdown to the

45:45 closing bell here on this Wednesday afternoon, I believe, Alix Steel, if I

45:49 got my days correct here and you missed a pretty big sell off yesterday, you're

45:53 back today. Big sell off in the market.

45:55 Yes, it was big, big organic. I'd say it was gigantic.

45:58 Enormous. We're now up.

45:59 So it's still by the dip, even if it's this measure that it is by the by the

46:03 dips, the clawing back a fraction of yesterday's losses, up about 5/10 of a

46:07 percent on the S&P 500. Stick with us.

46:09 Full coverage coming up right now as we take you to the bell and beyond,

46:14 Beyond the Bell Bloomberg's comprehensive cross-platform coverage of

46:19 the U.S. market.

46:19 Close starts right now. And right now, we are 2 minutes away

46:25 from the end of the trading day. Romaine Bostick alongside Alix Steel.

46:28 We're counting it down to the closing bell.

46:30 And here to help take us beyond the bell, it's a global simulcast.

46:34 Joined now here in our television studio by Scarlet Fu and in our radio booth

46:37 with Carol Massar and Tim Stanwick as we bring together our audiences across all

46:42 of our Bloomberg platforms, coming off a pretty big sell off yesterday, Carol.

46:46 And we're getting a modest rally today. Yeah, a modest rally bouncing around a

46:49 little bit. Obviously, to some extent.

46:51 Maybe the market selling a little bit of what we got from Fed Chair Jay Powell,

46:54 the New York Community Bancorp news as well.

46:58 But you know, something that has been solidly in the green for most of the day

47:00 is the Philadelphia Semiconductor index still up about 2.4% here with just a few

47:05 minutes to go in the Wednesday trade. You mentioned Powell's testimony.

47:09 That's where I want to go. I think investors are breathing a sigh

47:11 of relief that Jay Powell really stuck down the middle.

47:15 It wasn't a dove. He wasn't a hawk.

47:17 I think it was Steve MATTHEWS who said that some Fed chiefs like to refer to

47:20 themselves as owls, or Fed speakers like to refer themselves to the owls.

47:23 If we think about a different type of bird out there, I wanted to call him a

47:28 turducken because he kind of covered, you know, it's like down the middle a

47:31 lot of testimony that they lot of he answered a lot of questions.

47:34 I think he wants to be invisible right now.

47:36 Well, he's got to get through tomorrow before Thanksgiving is done.

47:39 By the end. I just have to think like

47:42 how much he must hate these things. He doesn't show it, though, with all the

47:46 trouble. Yeah, because getting paid.

47:47 This is part of your job. Maybe it's the job that you like the

47:49 least. But anyway, it was definitely a non

47:52 mover when it came to, say, the bond market.

47:54 You saw some buying on the back end, but that's pretty much it.

47:57 It'll be interesting to see day two of his testimony on the Senate tomorrow,

48:01 particularly in light of the news around New York Community Bancorp.

48:04 A lot of questions here about the health of the regional banking sector as we get

48:07 the closing bell here on this Wednesday afternoon.

48:10 A big flip flop from what we saw yesterday where everything looked dour

48:13 and a lot of those moving averages were being tested to the downside, a big

48:17 bounce off of those moving. Averages for all of the major indices.

48:21 The Dow Jones Industrial Average up 76 points or 2/10 of a percent.

48:24 The S&P 500 kind of closed higher, back above 5100 or about 5/10 of a percent

48:29 gain on the day. The Nasdaq back above 16,000 with a gain

48:33 of about 92 points or 6/10 of a percent. And the Russell 2000, that is a relative

48:38 laggard, only by a smidge, but it's up about 7/10 of a percent or 14 points.

48:41 I love that you said a smidge. All right.

48:43 Let's go to the S&P 500, 365 names, guys, to the upside here, 135 to the

48:49 downside and Scarlett three unchanged. And the leadership has really changed

48:53 over the last couple of hours to tech was the big gainer of the day, still up

48:58 9/10 of 1%. But you can see utilities moved to the

49:00 front there up by 1%. It's green mainly when you look at the

49:04 eye map, and that's because the sectors that are in the red are pretty limited.

49:08 We're talking about consumer discretionary, and that's on the back of

49:10 Tesla and communications services, which is down marginally off 2/10 of 1%.

49:16 All right, guys, let's get to some of the individual gainers.

49:18 I was really nervous to put this in because I thought it was kind of a sure

49:21 thing. And then, of course, it was bouncing

49:22 around and all the volatility. But New York Community Bank core, which

49:26 was at its lows, down 47%, it was halted.

49:29 Then we got the news of this, more than $1 billion equity investment, if you

49:32 will, our cash infusion, I should say. And then you also had the stock up as

49:37 much as 36%, many different halts as the volatility.

49:41 But the stock shares of New York Community Bank Corp finishing the day up

49:43 about seven and a half percent here on the day.

49:47 DuPont also mentioned CrowdStrike. That was definitely an outperformer

49:51 breaking the earnings last night at a time, up almost 23%, finishing the day

49:56 with a gain of just under 11%. So a top gainer in the Nasdaq 100

50:00 hitting a record high. The company reported, as you know,

50:03 fourth quarter results better than expected, and it did give an optimistic

50:06 outlook for the current period. I do want to point out several analysts

50:10 raising their price targets on that name following their results.

50:13 And then Dexcom wanted to go their finishing pretty much near its highs of

50:18 the day, up just shy of 10% here. It was a top throughout the day.

50:22 I think it's the number one gainer right now in the S&P 500.

50:25 Also a top gainer in the NASDAQ 100 heavy volume.

50:28 FDA giving clearance to its over-the counter stellar product, making it the

50:32 first glucose biosensor cleared in the U.S.

50:36 for use without a prescription. Wall Street cheering the announcement

50:39 with BTIG coming out saying the clearance came well ahead of their

50:42 expectations. So again, Dexcom shares up specifically

50:45 9.8%. All right.

50:47 Let's go get some of the decliners on the other side of the chart.

50:50 Taking a look at shares of Apple finished down by 6/10 of 1%.

50:54 It did fall slightly, though. It was the worst performer on a points

50:56 basis in the S&P 500. Just given its size, we should note

51:00 Apple shares falling to levels last seen October 27th.

51:03 It is down around 14% since those December highs.

51:06 Certainly want to watch. They're also Brown-Forman are the worst

51:10 performers on a percentage basis in the S&P 500 today fell as much as 10.5%

51:15 earlier in the session, finishing down by 7.3%.

51:18 It's the company behind Jack Daniel's and other liquors.

51:20 It lowered its fiscal year projections for organic net sales growth and organic

51:24 operating income growth shares shareholders reacting accordingly.

51:28 And check out shares of Foot Locker today.

51:30 Shares falling the most ever after the company pushed back a plan to expand its

51:34 sales. Yeah, $9.5 billion by two years after a

51:37 sluggish year Last year, shares finished third, down by 29.35%.

51:43 The company also predicted adjusted earnings of $1.50 to a dollar 70 per

51:47 share for this fiscal year. That did fall short of analyst estimates

51:50 and it did want to do a rare fourth decliner here.

51:53 Alex Xcel Energy Shares of Xcel Energy hitting their lowest level since March

51:58 of 2020, only finished down 4/10 of 1%. But they did fall as much as 3.8%

52:04 earlier in the session. This after Bloomberg News reported after

52:07 seeing photos that the toppled utility pole that Xcel Energy had been asked to

52:11 preserve as potential evidence was inspected and marked with a do not climb

52:15 symbol before the start of the worst wildfire in Texas history.

52:18 This is a stock that I talked about last week because there was a law firm that

52:22 sent a letter to Excel requesting it hold on to the pole and said the tag

52:26 said meaning had been met that had been flagged as needing attention during an

52:30 inspection earlier this year. Xcel shares down about 16% since

52:34 February 28. Yeah, it's been a really brutal ride for

52:37 Excel in relation to that. Guys buying on the curve pretty much.

52:40 We're looking at a bull flattening, buying everywhere.

52:42 You have more buying in the back end. Those the yields are a bit lower, about

52:46 45 basis points negative is the spread between the two.

52:49 But you know, we didn't learn that much from, Powell said.

52:52 She goes, I feel like the only thing we did learn is that inflation doesn't have

52:54 to hit 2%. Just the trajectory has to be towards

52:57 2%, which we already kind of knew. And we're doubling down on that.

53:00 Yeah, absolutely. I hear you know, it's interesting, too,

53:03 we talk about sort of, you know, Jay Powell on Capitol Hill and all the focus

53:07 right now on economic conditions. But it's quite interesting, too.

53:10 I mean, there are a couple of big stories out there that I think gives us

53:12 a little bit more insight into some of those conditions.

53:15 And one one stock that you didn't mention, I don't know if was Carroll's

53:18 job or Tim. A job that you failed was Vail Resorts

53:20 here. They actually are mean.

53:22 Maybe I should've left New York community Banker off my list.

53:26 Yeah. I don't know.

53:27 I don't know. A Brown-Forman tempts talking about

53:29 liquor. You ten doesn't drink.

53:30 What is it not? I know, but I did, you know.

53:32 Okay, so you're talking about Vail Resorts ticker empty and shares

53:36 finishing the day higher, up by more than 4% because Scarlet, they're able to

53:40 charge more for the epic pass. Yeah, there are already announcing their

53:43 2024 to 2025 season pass pricing. I mean, the 2023 to 2024 season isn't

53:48 even over yet, but the prices are up about 8% year over year to $982.

53:54 Granted, you can go to Beaver Creek, you can go to Whistler, you can go to

53:58 Hunter, you can go to Mount Snow. But that's some pricing power there.

54:01 Yeah, but isn't this just like Wall Street goes to Vail, right?

54:06 I mean, it's like, Yeah, yeah. But it's not like every day people are

54:08 going, we're not going. I will say I so I, I, Carole's heard

54:12 this a million times, but I lived in Vail when they unveiled the epic pass.

54:16 I spent three years after college there. This thing was revolutionary.

54:19 I mean, the cost of just a season pass in Vail.

54:22 This was back in like, you know, the mid to early 2000 was over $1,000 just for a

54:28 season pass in Vail when this epic pass came out and you could go ski at all the

54:33 Vail Resorts Mountains, which back then was about six or seven.

54:35 It didn't include all the ones that Scarlett just mentioned.

54:38 This was like 600 bucks at the time. I mean, it completely changed the ski

54:42 industry. You had Alterra come out and try to, you

54:44 know, compete with it. I can pass as well.

54:47 Exactly the icon pass as well. This completely changed the ski industry

54:51 and it also changed the cash flow for these companies too, because if you buy

54:55 a ski pass now and the snow isn't good next year, well then Vail Resorts ends

54:58 up being the winner. You know, one thing that I should

55:00 mention is that analysts have noted that the epic pass price price growth is

55:03 still about 19% below the CPI growth since March of 2020.

55:07 So they could have priced it even more aggressively.

55:10 Okay, fine. But there is some inflation there

55:11 because people are willing to pay for it.

55:13 Let's take the other side of it. Shrinkflation.

55:15 This has been all the talk over the last two days, guys, because Cookie Monster

55:18 is weighing in on this Cookie Monster we did member but you know, Fed member Do I

55:24 do Fed members telling me to just go, go, go, go.

55:27 He says Me hate Shrinkflation cookies are getting smaller.

55:30 I guess me going to have to eat double the cookies.

55:32 But the whole point is it's true. It's like, excuse me, by the way,

55:38 I could eat a lot better. I was I wasn't really committing to that

55:41 point. But the idea of Shrinkflation is you buy

55:43 the same thing, but they put less stuff in the package because everything's just

55:46 too expensive. So on the one hand, maybe you go to Vail

55:48 and pay the pass. In the other hand, your cookies are

55:50 small. Yeah, that's pretty depressing.

55:51 Now we've all talked about I feel like this has been happening right for some

55:54 time. So yeah, that's kind of a bummer.

55:56 First of all, you do a great Cookie Monster.

55:59 No better, no matter how good I feel at the most with ice cream

56:04 inflation, ice cream, shrinkflation and ice cream.

56:06 The one thing I will say no longer pint of ice cream.

56:08 Exactly right. I'm going to bring it back to.

56:11 And don't call me boring. But in the Beige book, right, businesses

56:14 found it harder to pass through a higher cost to their customers who became

56:17 increasingly sensitive to price changes. So I do wonder if maybe I don't know,

56:21 maybe this is some pushback just against the environment or a sign or maybe we're

56:25 pushing back against shrinkflation Like people are fed up, Carol.

56:28 We're fed up and we're not going to take you on climb out of here.

56:30 Tell me why cookies are always what I always want.

56:33 Cookies. All right, guys, that's a wrap across

56:35 platform radio, TV, YouTube and, of course, Bloomberg Originals.

56:38 We call it Beyond the Bell. We will see you again, same time, same

56:41 place tomorrow. All right.

56:45 Stick with us. Our coverage continues right here on

56:47 Bloomberg Television. A conversation on coming up with

56:50 Salesforce, signing a pledge to maximize AI's benefits and mitigate the risk.

56:55 At least that's how they're pitching it. We're going to have a conversation with

56:58 the woman behind that. Paula Goldman, chief ethical and humane

57:00 use officer at Salesforce, joining us in just a bit.

57:03 Stick with us. This is a close on Bloomberg.

57:09 And.

57:23 Welcome back to the clothes Romaine Bostick alongside Scarlet Fu.

57:26 And a closer look right now at personal finance and financial literacy.

57:31 Earn Your Leisure is a media empire built with the goal of giving rise to

57:34 undervalued and overlooked voices from the world of business, finance and

57:38 entrepreneurship. They want to get people who are

57:40 generally risk averse to, well, take a little bit more risk or at least a leap

57:43 into investing. And that includes a new partnership with

57:46 schools here in New York, in the Bronx, in Harlem, incorporating financial

57:49 literacy programs. Pleased to say that the co-founders of

57:52 Earn Your Leisure join us in studio once again, Rashad, Bilal and Joy Miller.

57:56 It's great to see you both once again. Thank you.

57:58 Thank you for having us. Appreciate it.

57:59 Let's start off with the partnership here in New York with those schools in

58:02 Harlem and the Bronx. What exactly are you guys going to be

58:05 doing? So we developed the financial literacy

58:07 curriculum and we think that this thing needed if you think about New York City,

58:10 the capital of capitalism. But financial literacy is not mandatory

58:14 in schools. And the schools that we went to, there

58:16 was no financial literacy 20 years ago, and there's no still financial literacy

58:19 to this day. So we developed a financial literacy

58:21 curriculum, four different modules for investing in financial literacy basics,

58:26 entrepreneurship, savings, investing credit.

58:30 And we're working with some schools in New York to pilot it.

58:34 I guess we can break that information here.

58:36 So, yeah, we got 1010 schools in the Bronx, ten schools in the Bronx.

58:40 We're going to pilot for this year and then next year roll it out to hopefully

58:45 the entire school district. How old are these kids that are going to

58:48 be using this? Predominately, it's going to be for high

58:50 school students, that kind of full circle.

58:51 You know, we started teaching young adults about the importance of financial

58:54 education. And so to come back, especially in the

58:57 Bronx, you know, we were both born and raised outside of the Bronx, but ended

59:01 up teaching there. So it's going to be a full circle

59:04 moment, like I said, and we're excited. That sounds really exciting and thank

59:07 you for sharing it with us. Obviously you want to get to kids when

59:10 they're young, like high school kids before they become adults and start

59:13 spending their money rather than perhaps saving a portion of it.

59:16 One of your challenges is getting people who are risk averse to take that leap

59:20 into investing. Is that easier or harder to do when

59:23 you've got stocks and Bitcoin at or near record highs?

59:27 MACHADO FOMO is a very real thing, and people want to, you know, take

59:32 tremendous risks when stocks and Bitcoin is at an all time high.

59:36 But we encourage dollar cost averaging where you put small amounts of money and

59:40 consistently every week or every month. That helps people, especially if they

59:45 have never invested. It's a lot easier to put $100 a week in

59:47 as opposed to putting $10,000 or $50,000 and is more responsible.

59:52 So we encourage that way of investing and a lot of people are familiar with

59:56 that with their phone case. So it's easier to kind of get them in

59:59 that mold as opposed to just putting your life savings into one thing.

01:00:02 But Troy, FOMO is a real thing and it happens to inexperienced investors as

01:00:05 well as really experienced investors. Institutional investors can't fall

01:00:08 behind their benchmarks for too long before they have to.

01:00:11 They're forced to make a move. Right.

01:00:12 So how do you address this in a way that stays true to your mission, but also

01:00:17 doesn't put them in a position to continue chasing things?

01:00:20 Yeah, I think the education part is the most important thing, right?

01:00:22 And so we tried to teach people from the beginning stage about the importance of

01:00:26 investing. We talked about dollar cost averaging,

01:00:28 but we also talk about understanding what you're investing in.

01:00:30 Right. We don't want people looking at charts

01:00:32 and saying, okay, that's green. I need to go with it.

01:00:34 We want to make sure that people have a fundamental understanding before they

01:00:37 make any investment. Right.

01:00:38 We always say, before you get into anything, make sure you know how you're

01:00:40 going to get out. So having people start where they are

01:00:43 and using what they have and having a fundamental base around investing in

01:00:47 stocks and definitely Bitcoin as important.

01:00:50 And so that's always what we stressed education first before you make any

01:00:52 move. I am curious about one component of this

01:00:54 literacy program, and that's the entrepreneurship side so much.

01:00:57 When we talk about financial literacy, it is about investing or about managing

01:01:01 your, you know, your personal finances, your credit and things like that.

01:01:04 But the entrepreneurship side of this to me seems relatively new.

01:01:07 I certainly didn't get that when I was a kid, but I'm seeing a lot more of that

01:01:11 show up in curriculums in high school and even in grade schools.

01:01:15 It's important you think about entrepreneurship.

01:01:18 Our community is underrepresented and that's really the driving engine of the

01:01:22 American economy. It always has been from large businesses

01:01:25 to small mom and pop businesses. So you don't become an entrepreneur by

01:01:29 accident. You actually have to learn

01:01:30 entrepreneurship. A lot of people learn entrepreneurship

01:01:33 on the fly like we did, but that's one of the reasons why it's such a low

01:01:36 percentage of exceeding as an entrepreneur.

01:01:39 So if you actually had some level of education about entrepreneurship, then

01:01:43 the chances of you actually being successful will probably go up.

01:01:46 So we want to give kids an alternative. You know, there's nothing wrong with

01:01:48 being an employee, right? But we need more business owners.

01:01:51 We need more people that employ other people.

01:01:53 So we want to teach them the fundamentals.

01:01:54 And you two are kind of walking examples of that.

01:01:56 I mean, you talk about your background as a teacher and building this business,

01:02:00 which is wildly successful. I was even told that you're actually

01:02:03 going to be at State of the Union address tomorrow.

01:02:05 But Troy, I mean, maybe you could address this idea because people aren't

01:02:08 just looking to you for advice. They're also looking to you guys as an

01:02:11 example. Yeah, I feel like this this movement has

01:02:13 been aspirational and aspirational. Yet at the same time, you know, like you

01:02:17 said, we started as 9 to 5 workers, but we realized very quickly that having one

01:02:22 income. Was too close to none.

01:02:23 And that seems to be a problem throughout our community.

01:02:26 And so what better way to create more incomes and create a business?

01:02:29 If we look at the wealthiest people in the world, they've all created

01:02:32 businesses and they have ownership inside of it.

01:02:34 And so, you know, we've seen pop shops inside of our communities, and now it's

01:02:37 time to figure out how do we scale, how do we create businesses that scale and

01:02:41 how do we create more wealth for not only our families from a generational

01:02:44 standpoint, but our communities as a whole?

01:02:46 As for your own business, we've seen that in the corporate world, a lot of

01:02:50 companies are actively moving away from putting resources into DEI programs, in

01:02:54 DEI efforts. I'm curious as to what that means for

01:02:57 your work. Does it limit what kind of corporate

01:03:00 partnerships you may have considered striking

01:03:04 or is always an uphill battle as far as dealing with corporate for a variety of

01:03:09 different reasons and a lot of things? Is it pink or hidden racism?

01:03:13 Right? When you have the numbers, you have the

01:03:16 impact, but you still have to prove yourself over and over again where your

01:03:20 counterparts that are different view as you don't have those same hurdles.

01:03:24 And that's hard to communicate with people that are not at the level that

01:03:27 actually, you know, understand that. So it's always been a challenge for us

01:03:31 as far as working with corporate. We do have some great corporate

01:03:33 partners, but we have always been self reliant.

01:03:35 We funded our business, we've never taken outside capital.

01:03:38 So regardless of our relationships with corporate, we're still going to, you

01:03:42 know, move forward. But it is challenging and is something

01:03:47 that I think should definitely be highlighted for sure.

01:03:49 I think that's one of the beautiful things about being an entrepreneur that

01:03:52 we can make our own rules, right? And so in order for those messages to

01:03:56 get out about what's happening, we have the free lance to say it and speak about

01:03:59 it and shed light on it. And as we climb, we're telling people

01:04:02 the experiences that we have and so that there could be some change.

01:04:05 All right, gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us today.

01:04:07 Or your leisure co-founders Rashad, Bilal and Troy Mullings speaking with us

01:04:11 today. We've got much more coming up on the

01:04:13 close because coming up, the rapid advance of A.I.

01:04:16 means finding a way to keep it under control.

01:04:19 Paula Goldmann, the chief ethical and humane use officer at Salesforce, will

01:04:23 be joining us next.

01:04:42 All right. With the recent and rapid acceleration

01:04:44 in AI technology comes concern about fair use and control.

01:04:49 Our next guest says that it's critical that we keep a human at the helm of AI.

01:04:54 Paula Goldman is joining us right now. She's an executive vice president and

01:04:57 the chief ethical and humane use officer at Salesforce.

01:05:00 Joining us today from the Trailblazer X Development Conference out there in San

01:05:04 Francisco. And Paula, I am curious about the

01:05:06 discussion out there because you've we talk about this idea of of having that

01:05:10 human still be a part of this process yet.

01:05:13 I don't know. We've had a parade of folks on this

01:05:14 program. They don't seem to be thinking about the

01:05:16 humans at all here. Where's the balance?

01:05:19 Well, you know, I think it's absolutely critical.

01:05:22 And we talk about it's a really exciting time for AI, but I think really rapidly

01:05:27 we're moving from A.I. just generating content to actually

01:05:31 taking action on our behalf. And that means that we need to have even

01:05:35 more sophisticated controls to make sure it works well.

01:05:37 So you've heard you've heard probably this term human in the loop, the idea

01:05:41 that people are reviewing each and every single day.

01:05:43 I keep generated content and we need to upgrade that.

01:05:48 We need better controls. We need to make sure that people are at

01:05:51 the driver's seat of AI, and that's what we're calling human at that.

01:05:54 Is this something that you're just doing internally there at Salesforce for your

01:05:58 own benefit, or is this something that you're also pushing to clients or maybe

01:06:02 the clients themselves are asking for it.

01:06:05 They're asking for it. Let me let me talk to you about that.

01:06:07 So we moved on. We're obviously always talking to our

01:06:10 customers formally, informally. We did a study of employees across our

01:06:14 customer base, 80% of them good news. They're saying AI is helping their work

01:06:20 lives get better, more productive. They're liking what's going on with the

01:06:23 AI products right now. 60% of them, though, are saying we need

01:06:27 human at the home, we need better controls.

01:06:29 Right. So they're asking for it.

01:06:31 The customers are asking for these types of jobs.

01:06:34 So I'm curious which institutions are which industries should be or are best

01:06:40 positioned to lead the way to ensure that there is a human at the helm?

01:06:44 Is it the public sector? Is it the tech sector or is it, you

01:06:48 know, the education sector? Yeah, I actually honestly, I believe

01:06:52 it's across the board. But obviously when you have

01:06:56 outcomes that are more risky, where we're talking about, you know, deciding

01:07:00 who gets a job, who gets a loan, that's then the controls become even more

01:07:04 important. But for example, we have a huge set of

01:07:07 products for service workers, right? And we're talking about next generation

01:07:11 controls for service use cases of let's say you've got a contact center, you've

01:07:16 got an audit trail, and you know exactly every not just one by one, the AI

01:07:21 interactions, but you can look across them and you can see where did they go

01:07:24 well, and where we might really need to fine tune the policy because the we keep

01:07:29 seeing people edit the AI output. It's that kind of stuff.

01:07:32 What are the controls look like and how do we upgrade them?

01:07:34 Okay, so when we talk about controls, there's obviously going to be discussion

01:07:38 about government regulation, some rules of the road, and there is the need to

01:07:42 create some regulations and that has bipartisan support.

01:07:45 But it's easy to see how Democrats and Republicans will end up squabbling over

01:07:49 details and find some way to disagree. How are the lines drawn right now from

01:07:54 where you sit in terms of what Democrats are pushing for, what Republicans are

01:07:57 pushing for, in terms of what we might get in the coming years?

01:08:01 You know, it's interesting. I am really optimistic about where

01:08:05 things are headed because if you look at the series of hearings and briefings in

01:08:10 the Senate, if you look at the commission that was recently announced,

01:08:14 as you said, it is bipartisan. And I think people are focusing on the

01:08:18 right questions. Right.

01:08:19 So how what are the sets of obligations and responsibilities across all of the

01:08:25 layer cake? So not just people that are creating

01:08:27 models, but people that are creating apps, people that are using the apps,

01:08:31 and what is the transparency obligations to consumers.

01:08:35 And those are the sets of the questions that are being worked out right now,

01:08:38 both in Congress, but also with voluntary efforts with the White House

01:08:43 and whatnot. And I think those are exactly the right

01:08:45 sets of question. When do we start seeing a little bit

01:08:47 more of that transparency, not just in the process, but and also the results,

01:08:51 I'm sure, Paula, you've seen, at least on the the chat bot side, some somewhat,

01:08:55 I guess, embarrassing results that have come out of court and some of the other

01:08:58 programs as well. But it's not so much that it was wrong.

01:09:02 It raised a lot of questions as to sort of what was put into that that led it to

01:09:06 that. And no one, at least no one outside of

01:09:08 those companies, seems to be able to provide an answer.

01:09:12 Yeah, I mean, these are very hard questions.

01:09:14 And it also I think these recent news stories also show that, you know,

01:09:19 customers need to be in control of their API.

01:09:21 The approach that we have taken at Salesforce on that question is to really

01:09:24 put the controls in the hands of our customers, to give them choice that they

01:09:28 can tune up and do now in their brand voice, they can tune up and tune down

01:09:32 how creative or not creative they want the air to be.

01:09:35 But again, here too, I think these are also questions where you do need

01:09:39 government to step in and take. Take a leap.

01:09:41 Right. And that's why you want you want to give

01:09:44 choice to customers. But you do also need are rules of the

01:09:47 road from government that everyone can apply.

01:09:50 Maybe we get that. But as you know how Washington works, it

01:09:52 could be a long time coming before we get something concrete.

01:09:55 In the meantime, though, everyone is left to their own devices, Paula.

01:09:58 And I'm curious as to how much of a discussion is going on out there, a

01:10:01 trailblazer and really and Salesforce overall about the security aspect of

01:10:05 this. We've heard from a lot of folks who've

01:10:07 raised concerns here about using these models and the idea that you have to

01:10:10 open up these models to make them effective.

01:10:12 But that, of course, also opens you up to exploitation.

01:10:16 Yeah, No, I you know, if we talk to our customers, top of mind for them are

01:10:19 security, data, integrity, privacy. They know what's going on with their

01:10:24 data. They know where it is or isn't going.

01:10:26 They don't want it to be used to train third party models, that kind of stuff.

01:10:30 The approach that we have taken here is also about what we call our trust layer,

01:10:33 which is a set of protections around the integrity of their data and the

01:10:36 security. And yes, we also have something that we

01:10:39 call a prompt defense. Right.

01:10:40 Because people are bad actors. Yes.

01:10:43 Are attacking these models and they're attacking a systems.

01:10:46 And those are it that's an ever changing threat vector.

01:10:49 And it's very that we keep up and protect against it.

01:10:52 All right, Paul, I really appreciate you taking time for us on the sidelines of

01:10:55 that big event out there in San Francisco.

01:10:57 Trailblazer de Paula Goldman, their chief humane officer over at Salesforce.

01:11:03 All right, let's turn Scarlet to Nordstrom.

01:11:06 I don't know if you were keep an eye on this, but the shares dropped about 16%

01:11:09 today. And that's a good reason to sort of look

01:11:11 back in history. And a lot of the efforts that department

01:11:13 stores have made over the years to really try and invent themselves

01:11:16 outside, reinvent themselves, to reinvent themselves outside the glare of

01:11:19 the public markets. Yeah.

01:11:21 And that leads me to a question I have for you.

01:11:23 What percentage of Nordstrom shares do you think is actually held by family

01:11:26 insiders enough to resist a lot of change?

01:11:28 How about that? Well, we're going to find out the answer

01:11:31 to that question. And a look back on this day in history

01:11:33 when we come back after the break. This is the close on Bloomberg.

01:11:57 All right. On this day, we take a look back at the

01:11:58 legacy of grand Department stores, grand retail ambitions and the glare of public

01:12:03 markets. It was on this day back in 2018 when

01:12:06 Nordstrom's shares opened sharply lower. This after investors had learned just

01:12:09 hours before that the company's board had rejected a buyout offer from the

01:12:13 founding family, a $50 a share bid that the board called inadequate.

01:12:17 Nordstrom shares, they were trading around $40 at that time.

01:12:20 They trade under $20 today. That episode six years ago, combined

01:12:25 with other take private efforts since including at Kohl's, Macy's, Michael's

01:12:28 and Chico's, raises a lot of questions, an age old question, if you will, about

01:12:31 an aging industry. Given the massive changes in the way

01:12:34 people shop, how does a legacy retail business craft a long term plan for

01:12:39 adapting when it's still subject to the short termism of Wall Street?

01:12:44 Case in point was back in 2017 when Nordstrom said it would experiment with

01:12:48 a no inventory store in West Hollywood, California, that would act as basically

01:12:52 a small showroom. Investors slammed the idea and slammed

01:12:55 the stock, pushing it down 3% the day of the announcement and Nordstrom moved on.

01:12:59 And this is exactly why a group representing the founding family in 2018

01:13:03 tried to take the company back. And this is exactly why they failed.

01:13:07 At the time, the Nordstrom family held at least 15% of the shares outstanding.

01:13:11 The number that is now since doubled with more than 30% of the shares

01:13:16 outstanding now held by insiders. In fact, there are only ten other

01:13:20 companies among the Russell 1000 that have a higher concentration of insider

01:13:24 control, and that includes names like News Corp, Lennar and Oracle.

01:13:28 Now, the takeover speculation did lift Nordstrom stock over the next few months

01:13:31 to as high as 67 bucks a share. But by mid 2019, the stock was below $30

01:13:36 and has never since re approach that $50 offer price.

01:13:40 There have been several overtures for the company since enough so that the

01:13:43 board actually adopted a poison pill in 2022 that would thwart any hostile

01:13:47 takeover attempts. This was similar to a strategy used by

01:13:50 Kohl's to fend off a multitude of activist investors, arts and craft

01:13:54 retailer. Michaels also spent years keeping the

01:13:56 barbarians at the gate, but finally succumb, agreeing to a $3 billion deal

01:14:00 with Apollo. They closed in 2021.

01:14:03 Sycamore Partners this year completed its $1 billion take private at Chico's,

01:14:06 and now Macy's finds itself in the same spotlight, staring down funds like Arc

01:14:11 House. And after Nordstrom's earnings last

01:14:13 night and the big share drop today, it showed a lot of muted revenue growth for

01:14:17 the next quarter and the year ahead. And maybe possible takeover chatter for

01:14:21 the retailer will pick up once again. You know, you start you talk about that

01:14:26 no inventory show room that is un-American, where you can't walk out of

01:14:29 the store with your product in hand. That's a disservice to the customer.

01:14:32 That's that's my take on it. All right.

01:14:34 Let's shift gears here, because Fed Chair Jay Powell, of course, appeared

01:14:38 before Congress today for his semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins testimony.

01:14:41 And he reiterated to lawmakers that the central bank is in no rush to cut rates

01:14:45 until the bitter battle over inflation was won.

01:14:49 We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening

01:14:53 cycle. If the economy evolves broadly as

01:14:56 expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint

01:15:01 at some point this year. The committee does not expect that it

01:15:03 will be appropriate to reduce the target range until it has gained greater

01:15:07 confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%.

01:15:12 Here with more insights into Power's testimony is Anna Wang of Bloomberg

01:15:16 Economics in Washington. Good to see you.

01:15:19 Jay Powell has said consistently that the Fed needs more data, wants more

01:15:23 data, not necessarily better data, just more data.

01:15:25 But if inflation data does end up coming in hotter like we saw with January's CPI

01:15:30 and CPI, won't that start morphing into wanting to see better data as well?

01:15:37 Yeah. I thought the most interesting thing

01:15:39 today is that Powell sounded more dovish than most of his colleagues that we have

01:15:44 heard from in the past three weeks. So Powell said that the data he needs to

01:15:49 see in the next couple of months is not necessarily better.

01:15:52 In fact, it could be worse than the past six months.

01:15:55 And still it's okay. And you know why it is, is that

01:16:00 even if inflation data were to accelerate a little bit and to be even

01:16:06 hotter than what we have seen in the past six months

01:16:09 to 12 months, change in core PCE is still likely going to hit 2.5% or below

01:16:16 by June. And today, Powell also said that he

01:16:20 doesn't need to see the 12 month change in inflation to hit 2% before cutting.

01:16:25 And that has been consistent with his message, which he has repeated four

01:16:31 times before, that they can start cutting well before inflation hit 2%.

01:16:36 These this was this there was a series of pointed questions that I remember the

01:16:39 lawmakers specifically on that and how he sort of how the math sort of works in

01:16:43 favor of that narrative. And I don't think anyone doubts that

01:16:46 there is going to be a somewhat dovish tilt to this Fed this year.

01:16:50 I think the doubt right now is whether we get three cuts or the four or five

01:16:54 whatever is priced into this market. And Powell didn't really articulate

01:16:58 that. In fact, he seemed pretty intent in

01:16:59 trying to avoid answering that question. Yeah, I think you can basically tell

01:17:06 from his tone that he's somewhat more dovish than the other committee members,

01:17:11 and he avoided that possibility because, you know, he's not sure.

01:17:16 And even though the S&P right now says 75 basis point of cuts this year, if you

01:17:21 go by the inertial Taylor Rule, which is what the committee has stuck to in the

01:17:26 past two years, it would have suggested 90 to 100 bips of rate cuts this year.

01:17:31 So certainly, I don't think they know even whether they're going to do 75 bips

01:17:35 or more. All right.

01:17:37 Well, Anna Wong over at Bloomberg Intelligence, Bloomberg Economics,

01:17:40 keeping an eye on this. And of course, we still have to wait to

01:17:42 March 20th for that Fed meeting. We did get a big central bank meeting

01:17:45 earlier today out of the Bank of Canada. Rates left on change and we get a big

01:17:49 one tomorrow. The European Central Bank holding its

01:17:51 second policy meeting of the year and most officials are urging patience on

01:17:56 those expectations for rate cuts until they see more evidence that inflation is

01:18:00 indeed slowing. Constantine FITE joining us right now,

01:18:03 PIMCO's portfolio manager and executive vice president and Constantine.

01:18:07 And no one's really expecting a change tomorrow.

01:18:10 But when it comes to the communication that we get out of Lagarde, do you think

01:18:13 that she's willing to sort of give the market a little bit more hope that those

01:18:17 rate cuts are indeed coming and coming sometime soon?

01:18:22 Yeah, I don't think so. I think the message will probably be

01:18:25 broadly similar, too, to what we've heard from her in the last meetings.

01:18:29 They are data dependent. They need to gain more confidence.

01:18:32 Services inflation is still too high. So it would be very surprised if we get

01:18:36 a little forward guidance from her tomorrow.

01:18:39 So the Fed has a preferred inflation gauge, right?

01:18:42 It likes to look at core PCI or the super core version as well.

01:18:47 Does the ECB have a preferred inflation gauge that markets kind of hone in on

01:18:52 and fixate on? Yeah, The ECB has a single mandate of 2%

01:18:58 inflation over the medium term. So typically to stop forecasts and we

01:19:01 will get new START forecasts tomorrow are obviously important.

01:19:06 So we get numbers four, 25 and 26. Again, they will probably come in

01:19:09 broadly at target both on headline and on core inflation, but I think there's

01:19:14 skepticism around. So as is inflation, I mentioned it

01:19:16 earlier, it's 4% roughly in the euro area, 5% in the US and six and a half

01:19:21 still in the U.K. So all the central banks are broadly in

01:19:24 the same boat right now. They need to be confident that wages

01:19:27 moderate, that that part of the inflation equation comes down before

01:19:30 cutting interest rates. Right.

01:19:32 I like how you say that all the central banks are kind of in the same boat right

01:19:34 now. Does that mean what's the likelihood

01:19:37 that the ECB would move ahead of the Fed when it does decide to cut rates or does

01:19:41 it need or want to wait for the Fed to do so first?

01:19:45 So they obviously looking at what the Fed is doing, but I don't think they

01:19:48 will be kind of thinking about going earlier or later than the Fed.

01:19:52 They will look at euro area wide inflation projections.

01:19:57 They will look at inflation developments in the euro area and policy transmission

01:20:01 and make a decision based on that. They probably don't want to go far ahead

01:20:06 of the Fed. But I don't think that there's a strong

01:20:09 view that they have to go a little bit before a little bit after the Fed.

01:20:13 A lot of investors are constantly in seemed like they're at least somewhat

01:20:16 comfortab
