Taiwan unveiled a prototype of its first submarine assembled at home as it prepares to stave off a potential invasion by China, a feat only made possible with the secretive help of other countries.

The Taiwanese Defense Ministry on Thursday staged the first sea trial of the diesel-electric vessel at its shipbuilder CSBC Corp.’s Kaohsiung dockyard. The submarine – named “Hai Kun” – is one of eight new vessels being developed under a multibillion-dollar program to bolster Taiwan’s naval defenses in the event of war with China.
