Former Vice President Mike Pence is challenging his one-time boss Donald Trump in a campaign that will put the spotlight on the deep personal rift between the once-close political allies and test whether a party dominated by the former president can accept someone who defied him.

Pence, 63, plans to formally announce his presidential campaign June 7 in Iowa, according to a person familiar with the plans.
