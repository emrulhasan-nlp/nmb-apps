00:13 >> THIS IS A VERY STRONG REPORT, A STRONG LABOR MARKET.

00:17 THE FED DOESN'T HAVE TO NORMALIZE POLICY AS QUICK.

00:21 >> THERE IS NO DATA THAT SAYS WE ARE HEADING TOWARD A CLIFF

00:23 OR WE WILL HAVE A SUDDEN SHIFT IN GROWTH.

00:26 >> SOME SIGNS OF SOFTENING.

00:29 >> THIS MEANS IT IS OFF THE TABLE.

00:35 IT MEANS YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO GET THE THREE CUTS THE FED HAS

00:37 SIGNALED.

00:41 >> WHETHER IT IS MARCH OR MAY OR JUNE, BUT IS ONLY EXPECT THE

00:43 FIRST CUT.

00:47 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE, WITH JONATHAN

00:50 FERRO, LISA ABRAMOWICZ AND ANNMARIE HORDERN. JONATHAN:

00:51 GOOD MORNING. THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE

00:59 ALONGSIDE LISA ABRAMOWICZ TOGETHER WITH ANNMARIE HORDERN,

01:02 I AM JONATHAN FERRO.

01:08 STARTING MONDAY, STILL TALKING ABOUT FRIDAY.

01:12 BRAMO, 353,000 REASONS TO TALK ABOUT FRIDAY.

01:17 CHAIRMAN POWELL'S COMMENTS OVER THE WEEKEND, THAT DATA FRIDAY

01:19 TURNS THE VOLUME UP A LITTLE BIT MORE. LISA:

01:24 ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE COMMENTARY SAME THE DATA MAY

01:27 HAVE UNDERESTIMATED THE RE-ACCELERATION OF THE U.S.

01:30 ECONOMY. WE SAW A WHOLE HOST OF OTHERS,

01:34 THIS IS INCREDIBLY BULLISH AND THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH DOES

01:37 THE FED HAVE TO WALK BACK SOME OF THE RATE CUTTING

01:42 EXPECTATIONS? JONATHAN:

01:44 STOCKS HAD A GREAT SESSION ON FRIDAY.

01:46 I WONDER HOW MUCH THAT BUCKET -- MARKET CAP MOVE JUST KIND OF

01:50 FLATTENED THE STOCK MARKET STORY A LITTLE BIT.

01:53 IT IS GOOD NEWS? LISA: NO. 73% OF THE RUSSELL 2000 WAS

01:58 LOWER. IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE GAUGE

02:03 OF THE REAL ECONOMY, IT IS NOT REFLECTING THAT $197 BILLION

02:07 INCREASE IN META-WE SAW ON FRIDAY. THERE IS AN EXISTENTIAL

02:11 QUESTION, WE SAW THE BIGGEST JUMP INTO YOUR YIELDS GOING

02:12 BACK TO MARCH.

02:18 -- JUMP IN TO YOUR YIELDS GOING BACK TO MARCH.

02:23 -- TWO YEAR YIELDS GOING BACK TO MARCH. JONATHAN:

02:27 THIS IS THE STORY OVER AND CHINA. U.S.

02:31 EQUITY MARKETS, ALL-TIME HIGHS, CHINA WHIPSAWED AGAIN.

02:36 GOLDMAN SACHS WRITING THIS, THE MOST REGALLY ASKED QUESTIONS

02:39 AMONG LOCAL INVESTORS IN CHINA INCLUDE IMPLICATIONS FOR CHINA

02:42 SHOULD DONALD TRUMP BECOME THE NEXT U.S. PRESIDENT.

02:45 THIS IS BECOMING A BIG DEAL. LISA:

02:48 IT IS AND HE IS -- ANNMARIE: IT IS AND HE IS KEEPING CHINESE

02:51 INVESTORS UP AT NIGHT. THE FORMER PRESIDENT WAS ASKED

02:54 ABOUT IT THIS WEEKEND ON FOX NEWS, ABOUT THIS 60% BLANKET

02:58 TARIFF ON CHINESE IMPORTS. IT WAS WRITTEN UP IN THE

03:02 WASHINGTON POST AND HE SAID NO, IT IS GOING TO BE MORE THAN 60%

03:05 AS A POTENTIAL POLICY. LISA: YOU GOT PLUNGE PROTECTION

03:10 PATROL COMING OUT IN FULL FORCE. YOU HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR 60%

03:14 TARIFFS BEING THROWN OUT. THE WHOLE RELATIONSHIP IS MESSY.

03:19 JONATHAN: CHINA COMING OUT AND SAYING

03:21 THEY WILL DO STUFF AND TELLING US WHAT -- WITHOUT TELLING US

03:23 WHAT THAT STUFF IS. THEY DON'T WANT PEOPLE TALKING

03:27 ABOUT A STOCK MARKET THAT IS STRUGGLING. LISA:

03:30 THEY'VE GOT A LONG WAY TO GO BECAUSE THE STRUGGLE HAS BEEN

03:31 REAL. THEY HAVEN'T SEEN ANY REAL RETURNS SINCE 2015.

03:38 HOW MUCH CAN THEY SUPPORT THAT? HOW MUCH IS THAT DUE TO THE

03:40 U.S.-CHINESE RELATIONSHIP? JONATHAN:

03:44 WHAT DOES THE PLUNGE PROTECTION TEAM ACTUALLY ACHIEVE?

03:51 THEY ADDRESS THE SYMPTOMS. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THAT ILLNESS

03:53 ANY A LOT WORSE. LISA: JUST TO PUT SOME NUMBERS ON

03:56 THIS. $7 TRILLION HAS BEEN ERASED

04:02 FROM THE VALUE OF EQUITIES IN CHINA AND HONG KONG SINCE 2021.

04:07 IS THIS BECAUSE OF THE RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC OR BECAUSE

04:08 HOUSEHOLDS ARE NOT SPENDING? YES IS THE ANSWER.

04:12 HOW DID THEY GRAPPLE WITH THIS? FOR NOW, PLUNGE PROTECTION

04:14 PATROL. JONATHAN: CHINESE EQUITIES AT MULTIYEAR

04:19 LOWS. YOUR EQUITY MARKET, S&P 500

04:26 FUTURES PULLING BACK BY 0.2 PERCENT.

04:28 YIELDS ARE HIGHER ON A 10 YEAR.

04:37 THE FX MARKET, A TOUCH OF DOLLAR STRENGTH AND THE EURO

04:38 WEAKER. LISA: WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT HOW

04:42 THE U.S. HAS LED THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK

04:45 AND AT WHAT POINT IS GOOD NEWS GOOD NEWS?

04:48 CAN THE FED CUT RATES TRULY IS MUCH AS PEOPLE PREVIOUSLY

04:51 EXPECTED? MAYBE THE ECB TRULY WILL CUT

04:54 FIRST. JONATHAN: COMING UP, NO CONVERSATIONS

04:57 ABOUT THE G10.

05:08 RBC CAPITAL MARKET --

05:14 A BLOT JOBS REPORT.

05:23 LORI CALVO SENA SAYING -- LORI CALVASINA SAYING THIS, I

05:25 SIGHTLY BETTER INFLATION OUTLOOK HAS CAUSED OUR

05:28 VALUATION MODEL TO GET A LITTLE BIT MORE CONSTRUCTIVE.

05:30 IT IMPLIES THAT THE S&P 500 COULD MOVE TO 5500 AT YEAR-END

05:31 2024. COULD WE START ON FRIDAY AND

05:39 ASK YOU, DOES THAT JOBS REPORT DERAIL THIS SOFT LANDING STORY?

05:41 LORI: THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. I DON'T GET THE RAILS ANYTHING

05:44 AT ALL. GIVE OUR RATES TEAM A LOT OF

05:48 CREDIT. THEY'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR THE

05:51 FED TO START CUTTING IN JUNE BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY DIDN'T

05:54 THINK THAT THE DATA WAS GOING TO COOPERATE BEFORE THEN.

05:58 WE DIDN'T THAT WE WERE GOING TO SEE ANY KIND OF BIG EROSION AND

06:01 THE UNDERLYING U.S. ECONOMY AND THEY'VE ALWAYS

06:02 THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE ABOUT ADJUSTMENT CUTS.

06:06 FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE, THINGS ARE PLAYING OUT AS THE RATES

06:08 TEAM HAD ANTICIPATED. LISA:

06:15 MEANWHILE, OVER THE WEEKEND, EVERCORE SSI CAME OUT AND SAID

06:23 STICKY INFLATION, EXTENDED VALUATIONS FROM THESE LEVELS

06:24 POINT TO WEAK FORWARD RETURNS. WHY DO YOU DISAGREE? LORI:

06:30 WE LOOK AT VALUATION VERY DIFFERENTLY.

06:31 BUT A LOT OF MY PEERS DO IS THEY SAY HERE IS WHAT THE

06:36 MULTIPLE IS, THE LONG-TERM AVERAGES.

06:40 AND THEY MAKE SOME ASSUMPTION ABOUT WHERE IT SHOULD BE AND IF

06:43 IT IS TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW. WE BUILT A DIFFERENT MODEL OVER

06:49 GO BACK TO THE 1960'S AND LOOK AT AVERAGE ADJUSTED DATA AND WE

06:55 ATE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT OF THE -- WITH FED FUNDS AND WITH GDP.

06:58 WHEN YOU TAKE INTO CONSENSUS ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT WHERE ALL OF

07:02 THOSE MACRO VARIABLES ARE HEADED, IT IS BASICALLY TELLING

07:07 US WE CAN SPOT A TRAILING PE AROUND THE END OF THIS YEAR AND

07:09 IF YOU MARRY THAT WITH MY EARNINGS NUMBER, AT POINTS YOU

07:13 TO SOMETHING VERY ROBUST AT THE END OF THE YEAR.

07:16 WE'VE USED THIS MODEL FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF OR LONGER.

07:20 LAST YEAR WAS THE FIRST YEAR WE DID USE IT FOR THE FULL YEAR

07:24 AND IT WAS CONSISTENTLY POINTING US TO A 22 TIMES

07:28 TRAILING PE AT THE END OF THE YEAR AND S&P THAT COULD END THE

07:29 YEAR AT 4800. I DIDN'T LISTEN TO THAT MODEL

07:34 ENOUGH, BUT IT WAS TELLING US TO CHALLENGE THE ASSUMPTIONS OF

07:39 WHERE PEOPLE THINK PE SHOULD BE AND THE HIGHER MULTIPLE AS

07:42 POSSIBLE GIVEN THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE ECONOMY, GIVEN THE BIG

07:47 MODERATION IN INFLATION AND INTEREST RATES AREN'T ABLE TO

07:51 OFFSET THAT BIG MODERATION WE ARE SEEING. LISA:

07:55 HOW DISTORTED ARE THE MODELS BASED ON THE MAGNIFICENT FOUR

07:59 OR JUST META? LORI: THE IMPACT OF THOSE BIG NAMES

08:04 MATTER BUT WHAT I LOVE ABOUT OUR MODEL AS IT CAPTURES THE

08:06 1970'S WHEN IT WENT THROUGH THE NIFTY 50 PERIOD.

08:10 WE ALSO HAVE THE 2000 PERIOD BAKED IN AS WELL.

08:14 WE ARE STRETCHED IN TERMS OF THE CONCENTRATION BUT THAT IS

08:16 WHEN WE THINK -- THAT IS WHAT WE THINK IS ONE OF THE BENEFITS

08:21 OF THE MARKET, -- OF THE MODEL, TAKING IN THESE PRIOR PERIODS

08:23 WHEN YOU HAD LESS CONCENTRATION. WE REALLY NEED TO BE LOOKING AT

08:30 MULTIPLE CYCLES TOAST -- TO FIGURE OUT WHAT RULES OF THUMB

08:31 WE SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR. I STRONGLY BELIEVE WE ARE IN

08:36 THE EARLY POST-COVID ERA OF INVESTING AND WE DON'T KNOW

08:37 WHAT THESE NEW RULES OF THUMB ARE.

08:40 YOU CAN LOOK AT HISTORY AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT CYCLES TO

08:42 UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE RULES MIGHT BE. JONATHAN:

08:45 I'M SO PLEASED THAT LISA BROUGHT UP META.

08:50 THE BIGGEST INCREASE, SINGLE DAY INCREASE IN MARKET CAP EVER

08:53 IN THE HISTORY OF U.S. MARKETS. ALMOST $200 BILLION.

08:58 WHAT IS YOUR TAKE AWAY FROM HEADLINES LIKE THAT? LORI:

09:02 I THINK IT HAS BEEN AN INTERESTING REPORTING SEASON.

09:06 I CAN'T TALK ABOUT ANY NAME IN PARTICULAR BUT ONE OF THE

09:08 THINGS WE HAVE SEEN COMING INTO THIS REPORTING SEASON IS THAT

09:14 IF YOU LOOK AT FORMER -- FORWARD-LOOKING GROWTH

09:15 EXPECTATIONS FOR THE TOP SEVEN NAMES IN THE MARKET, THE

09:19 EARNINGS GROWTH ADVANTAGE OF THOSE TOP SEVEN RELATIVE TO THE

09:21 MUSTACHED THE REST OF THE MARKET IS EXPECTED TO ENDURE

09:23 BUT ALSO EXPECTED TO SHRINK. I'M NOT SURE WHAT INVESTORS ARE

09:28 GOING TO PAY MORE ATTENTION TO, THE DOMINANCE OR THE FACT THE

09:30 DOMINANT ARE BECOMING LESS DOMINANT.

09:33 WE HAVE SEEN THINGS GO BACK AND FORTH IN TERMS OF THE TOP SEVEN

09:36 NAMES OVER THE LAST WEEK. I THINK IT STILL IS TBD.

09:44 A LOT OF WORK SUGGESTING THIS MARKET IS READY TO ROTATE AND

09:45 WANTS TO ROTATE. WE NEED MORE EXCITEMENT ABOUT

09:50 THE UNDERLYING ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT TO KIND OF BOOST

09:53 THE EARNINGS GROWTH EXPECTATIONS OF THE NAMES

09:54 OUTSIDE THE TOP SEVEN. JONATHAN: FRIDAY SHOULD CONTRIBUTE TO

09:56 THAT. YOU CAN DO SECTORS. WHAT ARE THE SECTOR PREFERENCES

10:00 NOW? LORI: WE ARE LEANING INTO THINGS LIKE

10:03 FINANCIALS. WE LIKE ENERGY, HEALTH CARE,

10:06 UTILITIES. WE HAVE SAID THAT ON THE BIG

10:11 GROWTH SECTORS, WE DON'T WANT TO GO UNDERWEIGHT.

10:15 TECHNOLOGY, CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY AS WELL.

10:16 I WOULD TELL YOU THAT COMMUNICATION SERVICES ARE

10:19 WHERE SOME OF THESE BIG NAMES ARE SITTING, MAKING A MUCH

10:23 STRONGER VALUATION CASE. WE ARE STILL NEUTRAL BUT THE

10:29 VALUATION WORKS, JUST NOT FLAGGING IS POSITIVE. LISA:

10:34 HOW CAN YOU GET BULLISH ON ENERGY AT A TIME WHERE IT SEEMS

10:36 LIKE U.S. SUPPLY IS COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED, POLITICAL RISK AND

10:42 PRICES HAVE DROPPED EVEN WITH THE HANGUP OF WHAT IS GOING ON

10:43 IN THE RED SEA? LORI: I WOULD TELL YOU IT IS A CLOSE

10:47 CALL. OUR ANALYSTS ARE STILL HIGHLY

10:50 BULLISH. WE LIKE THE VALUATION DYNAMICS

10:55 AND I LOOK AT IT AS A BIT OF A HEDGE IN MY PORTFOLIO.

10:59 A LOT OF THE AREAS WE ARE LOOKING AT ARE THINGS LIKE

11:00 FINANCIALS WHICH SHOULD BENEFIT IF WE CONTINUE TO SEE CONSUMER

11:02 CONFIDENCE RECOVER. ENERGY IS AN AREA THAT DOES NOT

11:05 DO WELL WHEN THAT HAPPENS. IT IS ALSO AN AREA THAT DOESN'T

11:09 DO AS WELL WHEN INTEREST RATES ARE RISING OR WOULD INTEREST

11:12 RATES ARE FALLING. WE VIEW IT AS KIND OF A HEDGE

11:16 ON THE IDEA THAT INFLATION IS MODERATING, INTEREST RATES ARE

11:18 GOING TO GIVE US A LITTLE BIT OF RELIEF.

11:22 WE THINK ANY CALL ON THE MARKET THESE DAYS HAS ABOUT A 60%

11:26 CONVICTION LEVEL AND WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THESE AREAS THAT ARE

11:28 COUNTER CONSENSUS ON THE MACRO NARRATIVE IN THE BACK POCKET OF

11:30 OUR PORTFOLIO. JONATHAN: LORI CALVASINA OF RBC.

11:36 LOW CONVICTION CALLS AT THE MOMENT. LET'S SIT ON CRUDE FOR A

11:38 MOMENT. BRENT CRUDE DOWN 0.5%.

11:44 DOWN 0.6% ON WTI. WE HAD STRIKES ON FRIDAY.

11:49 AMH, WE HAD THE RETALIATION WE WERE WAITING FOR AN BRENT CRUDE

11:55 IS DOWN. ANNMARIE: WHEN I SEE THIS GEOPOLITICAL

12:00 ENVIRONMENT AND SEE THAT BRENT AND WTI ARE LOWER, YOU HAVE TO

12:05 THINK, HOW MUCH LOWER WOULD CRUDE ACTUALLY BE IF THERE

12:06 WASN'T GEOPOLITICAL TENSION RIGHT NOW IN THE MIDDLE EAST?

12:10 HOW LOW COULD THESE PRICES HAVE BEEN?

12:11 SOME OF THAT RISK IS PRICED IN. JONATHAN:

12:14 WHAT IS YOUR READ ON THIS? IS THIS MARKET JUST DRAWING A

12:18 CONCLUSION THAT THE WHITE HOUSE DOESN'T WANT BROADER CONFLICT?

12:20 ANNMARIE: I THINK THERE ARE TWO THINGS.

12:25 UNITED STATES DOES NOT WANT TO NEXT LOOK -- AN ESCALATION OF

12:26 BROADER CONFLICT. THEY ARE TRYING TO DEGRADE THE

12:32 IRANIAN PROXIES' ABILITIES. 14 POINT 2 MILLION BARRELS A

12:38 DAY THE UNITED STATES HAS. THIS IS A RECORD ANY COUNTRY

12:40 HAS EVER SET. CHINA IS STILL GETTING OIL AND

12:43 GAS FROM RUSSIA. RUSSIA IS STILL ON THE MARKET.

12:47 IRAN IS STILL EXPORTING. VENEZUELA HAS SOME CRUDE ON THE

12:50 MARKET. THERE ARE ADVERSARIES AGAINST

12:55 THE UNITED STATES WHO HAVE CRUDE ON THE MARKET ON TOP OF

12:57 THE FACT THAT THE U.S. IS THE WHALE IN THE U.S.

12:59 CRUDE MARKET. THE WHITE HOUSE JUST DOESN'T

13:02 WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. LISA: I WONDER IF PEOPLE JUST AREN'T

13:06 PAYING ATTENTION BECAUSE IT IS THE WOULD'VE MAKER TRADE.

13:09 ANY TIME SOMEONE TRIES TO BET ON OIL, IT HAS FAILED.

13:15 AT A CERTAIN POINT THERE ARE A COUPLE MODELS THAT IF THIS DID

13:20 ERUPT AND IRANIAN OIL WAS TAKEN OFF THE MARKET, PRICES WILL GO

13:21 TO $90 A BARREL. JONATHAN: I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:26 71.81 ON WTI.

13:31 >> FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP SAYS HE MIGHT IMPOSE A

13:35 FLAT TARIFF ON CHINESE GOODS OF MORE THAN 60% IF ELECTED.

13:41 AN INCREASINGLY HAWKISH TONE AGAINST THE TOP SUPPLIER OF

13:43 GOODS TO THE U.S.. FROM PROJECTED CRITICISM THAT

13:47 ACTIONS WOULD START A TRADE WAR. THE U.S.

13:50 HAS BEEN CHINA'S BIGGEST EXPORT MARKET FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS

13:55 INCLUDING OVER $500 BILLION IN EXPORTS IN 2022.

14:01 BOEING IS LOWER IN PREMARKET TRADING AFTER THE AIRCRAFT

14:04 MAKER FOUND THEY -- FOUND MORE

14:10 PROBLEMS. THEY WILL REQUIRE REPAIRS AND ABOUT 50

14:13 UNDELIVERED JETS, AND MAY DELAY PLANE DELIVERIES IN THE NEAR

14:14 TERM. THE DEFECT FOLLOWS A STRING OF

14:17 MANUFACTURING LAPSES, PROMPTING THE FAA TO STEP UP SCRUTINY OF

14:22 THE COMPANY. CANADA EXTENDED THEIR BAN ON

14:26 FOREIGN HOMEBUYERS FOR ANOTHER TWO YEARS WITH A MEASURE NOW

14:28 SET TO EXPIRE IN 2027. THE REAL ESTATE MARKET HAS

14:33 STARTED HEATING UP RECENTLY AS IT BECOMES CLEAR THE BANK OF

14:37 CANADA MAY BE IN A POSITION TO CUT INTEREST RATES LATER THIS

14:40 YEAR. THE NATIONAL HOME PRICE AVERAGE

14:42 IN CANADA HAS JUMPED 36% IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS.

14:45 THAT IS YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF. JONATHAN: YOU KNOW THIS.

14:49 THE HOUSING MARKET IN CANADA IS LIKE A MICROWAVE.

14:52 THE HEAT TURNS UP SO QUICKLY. JUST THE TALK OF REDUCING

14:55 INTEREST RATES. LISA: THIS COMES AT A TIME WHEN THAT

15:01 IS A MUCH MORE INTEREST-RATE VULNERABLE SECTOR THAN IN THE

15:03 UNITED STATES. WE HAVE NOT RESOLVED THE SMALL

15:07 BANKING OR COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE.

15:13 WE HAVE NOT RESOLVED IF THIS IS A HOUSING MARKET ON TENDER

15:15 HOOKS AND IF MORE VOLUME COULD CAUSE PRICES TO GO DOWN.

15:18 JONATHAN: UP NEXT ON THIS PROGRAM, THE

15:20 WHITE HOUSE PROMISING MORE STRIKES IN THE MIDDLE EAST. >>

15:24 THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR FROM THE BEGINNING, THAT

15:28 WHEN AMERICAN FORCES ARE ATTACKED, WE WILL RESPOND.

15:34 IT BEGAN WITH STRIKES ON FRIDAY NIGHT. JONATHAN: GOOD MORNING.

15:41 ♪

15:57 JONATHAN: LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY.

16:02 KIND OF WEIRD, THE YIELDS ARE UP ON CHAIRMAN POWELL, UP SIX

16:08 BASIS POINTS ON A 10 YEAR, UP MORE ON THE TWO YEAR.

16:14 AS WE SET THE TOP OF THE PROGRAM, MAYBE THE JOBS NUMBER

16:15 FRIDAY TURNS THE VOLUME UP A LITTLE BIT MORE. LISA:

16:19 THERE WAS A SCHOOL OF THOUGHT THAT HE MADE A MISTAKE IN THE

16:23 PRESS CONFERENCE AND JUST SAID IT IS NOT LIKELY.

16:28 THE FACT THAT HE THOUGHT IT THROUGH AND REALLY PUT OUT

16:32 THERE WHY MARCH IS NOT LIKELY, IT SORT OF CODIFIED AND MADE IT

16:34 SEEM LIKE IT WAS NOT AN ACCIDENT AND VERY DELIBERATE

16:35 THAT HE SAID THAT. JONATHAN: JOBS ON FRIDAY SCREAMED MARCH

16:39 IS NOT LIKELY. LISA: THE DATA DEFINITELY SEEMS TO

16:44 CONFIRM BUT WE HAVE A SLEW OF FED SPEAK THIS WEEK. JONATHAN:

16:47 WE WILL GO THROUGH THE SPEAKERS LATER.

16:50 THE WHITE HOUSE PROMISING MORE STRIKES IN THE MIDDLE EAST. >>

16:56 THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR FROM THE BEGINNING, WHICH

16:59 IS WHEN AMERICAN FORCES ARE ATTACKED, WE WILL RESPOND ALL

17:03 STOP IT BEGAN WITH THE STRIKES ON FRIDAY NIGHT BUT THAT IS NOT

17:04 THE END OF IT.

17:06 THE PRESIDENT IS DETERMINED TO RESPOND FORCEFULLY TO ATTACKS

17:10 ON OUR PEOPLE. THE PRESIDENT ALSO IS NOT

17:12 LOOKING FOR A WIDER WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST. JONATHAN:

17:16 THE WHITE HOUSE PROMISING THEY WILL TAKE JUST ENOUGH ACTION

17:19 AGAINST IRAN TO SEND A FORCEFUL MESSAGE WHILE AVOIDING A WIDER

17:22 WAR. OFFICIALS FRAMING THE STRIKES

17:24 AS A NECESSARY AND INEVITABLE RESPONSE TO THE KILLING OF

17:26 THREE U.S. SOLDIERS IN A DRONE STRIKE AND

17:28 JORDAN A WEEK AGO. JOINING US NOW IS NORMAN ROULE,

17:34 ADVISOR FOR THE TRANSIT NATIONAL THREAT -- GREAT TO

17:39 CATCH UP WITH YOU. LET'S START WITH THE STRIKES

17:41 THAT STARTED ON FRIDAY EVENING. BUT AT THE LATEST STRIKES WERE

17:46 SHE -- WHAT HAVE THE LATEST STRIKES ACHIEVED THE PREVIOUS

17:50 STRIKES DID NOT? NORMAN: THESE STRIKES DESTROYED A

17:54 SERIES OF COMMAND AND CONTROL INTELLIGENT CENTERS THAT WERE

17:55 IMPORTANT TO THE MILITANTS TARGETING U.S. FORCES.

17:58 THEY DESTROYED A LARGE AMOUNT OF STOCKPILES OF MISSILES,

18:03 ROCKETS AND KILLED A SMALL NUMBER OF MID-LEVEL AND LOW

18:06 LEVEL MILITANT OFFICIALS. THEY DEMONSTRATED THE ACCURACY

18:11 AND SOPHISTICATION AND SKILL OF U.S.

18:13 LONG-RANGE AIR ASSETS WHICH IN ITSELF IS A MESSAGE TO IRAN.

18:17 ANNMARIE: WEEKEND WE ALSO HEARD FROM --

18:20 ANNMARIE: OVER THE WEEKEND WE ALSO HEARD

18:23 FROM JAKE SULLIVAN ALMOST TALKING ABOUT DIFFERENT

18:26 STRATEGIES. HE SAID THIS WILL NOT BE THE

18:29 END OF OUR RESPONSE AND THERE WILL BE MORE STEPS IN A

18:31 SUSTAINED WAY BUT IN THE SAME BREATH HE SAID I WOULD NOT

18:34 DESCRIBE IT AS AN OPEN ENDED MILITARY CAMPAIGN.

18:36 WHAT IS THE STRATEGY? NORMAN: THE STRATEGY APPEARS TO BE WE

18:46 RESPOND TO THE ACTIONS AND CAPACITY OF OUR ADVERSARIES.

18:48 YOU WILL SEE A HEAVY INTELLIGENCE DRIVEN PROGRAM.

18:51 IN YEMEN WE ARE NOW STRIKING MISSILES ON THE GROUND AND

18:54 DRONES ON THE GROUND AS THEY PREPARE TO TAKE OFF.

18:58 I WOULD EXPECT TO SEE SOMETHING SIMILAR IN SYRIA AND WESTERN

18:59 IRAQ. PROXIES WILL HOLD BACK IN THE

19:04 NEAR TERM BECAUSE THEY DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE U.S.

19:08 IS GOING TO DO BUT AS THEY RAMP UP THEIR ATTACKS AND AS

19:10 EVIDENCE APPEARS, YOU WILL SEE THE U.S.

19:12 RESPOND TO PROTECT ITS FORCES. . ANNMARIE:

19:19 IS THIS DEGRADING, DETERRING OR DEFENSE WHEN IT COMES TO THE

19:20 U.S. RESPONSE ON IRANIAN PROXIES?

19:24 NORMAN: PRIMARILY IT IS DEFENSE, AIMED

19:26 AT DEGRADING BUT WE SHOULD BE CLEAR, WE ARE NOT TOUCHING

19:30 EQUITIES, ASSETS OR PERSONNEL THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT TO THE

19:34 SENIORMOST LEADERSHIP IN IRAN OR THE PROXY WORLD.

19:36 THERE ARE REPORTS THAT A NUMBER OF AFGHAN MILITANTS WERE KILLED

19:38 IN SYRIA. BUT THE LOSS OF THESE

19:44 INDIVIDUALS IS NOT GOING TO SHAPE IRAN OR PROXY REGIONAL

19:46 STRATEGIES. THEY WILL WAIT AND SEE WHERE WE

19:51 GO AND WE WILL WAIT AND SEE WHERE THEY GO. LISA:

19:56 HOW VULNERABLE ARE U.S. TROOPS RIGHT NOW STATIONED IN

19:59 IRAQ AND SYRIA AND FRANKLY, THE MIDDLE EAST? NORMAN:

20:04 WE'VE DEMONSTRATED OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS THAT THE

20:06 U.S. HAS AN EXTRAORDINARY SOPHISTICATED CAPACITY TO

20:10 DEFEND ITS PERSONNEL FROM MISSILE, DRONE AND ROCKET

20:13 ATTACKS WE ARE SEEING FROM YEMEN AND IRAN AND ELSEWHERE.

20:15 BUT MISTAKES HAPPEN. A MISSILE WILL GET THROUGH.

20:20 THIS IS A VERY HIGH THREAT ENVIRONMENT.

20:23 WE SHOULD NOT DOWNPLAY THAT, BUT WE DO HAVE CONSIDERABLE

20:26 DEFENSIVE CAPACITY AND WE HAVE SEEN THIS DISPLAYED OVER AND

20:28 OVER AGAIN. THE PROBLEM IS DEFENSE IS NOT

20:34 DETERRENCE, IT JUST TELLS YOUR ADVERSARY TO KEEP TRYING UNTIL

20:35 THEY GET ONE THROUGH. LISA: WHAT IS THE EFFECTIVE POLICY TO

20:39 TRY AND END THE ATTACKS, TRY TO END SOME OF THE 160 PLUS

20:44 ATTACKS ON THE AMERICAN BASES IN THE REGION? NORMAN:

20:50 FOR THE HOUTHI'S, WE HAVE TO DESTROY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE,

20:51 THERE MISSILE AND DRONE CAPACITY ON THE GROUND.

20:55 THAT WOULD PREVENT ATTACKS TO SHIPPING.

20:57 WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THEY NEVER BUILD THE CAPACITY TO

21:00 TOUCH THE UNDERGROUND SEE CABLES -- SEA CABLES THAT

21:04 HANDLE MOST OF THE TRAFFIC ON THE INTERNET BETWEEN EUROPE AND

21:06 ASIA. IN THE NORTH, OUR AIR FORCE

21:14 WILL BE WORKING TO IDENTIFY AND DEGRADE CAPACITY AS IT APPEARS

21:15 TO BE A THREAT. I DON'T SEE THIS MOVING TO A

21:21 U.S.-IRAN CONFRONTATION BUT AS IRANIAN ACTORS RETURN TO THE

21:23 AREA, IT IS NOT INCONCEIVABLE THAT IRANIANS WILL BE KILLED IN

21:26 THE U.S. -- IN THE U.S. RESPONSES. JONATHAN:

21:32 WALL STREET SURPRISED BY HOW CALM THINGS HAVE BEEN IN THE

21:39 COMMODITY MARKETS.

21:40 WHERE DOES SAUDI ARABIA FIT INTO THE CURRENT TENSION?

21:42 NORMAN:

21:49 WE HAVE A VAST AMOUNT OF ENERGY IN THE MARKET BEING REROUTED.

21:54 SAUDI ARABIA ALSO HAS ITS EAST-WEST PIPELINE TO DELIVER A

21:55 FAIR AMOUNT OF OIL. YOU HAVE A RATHER ROBUST

22:01 TRUCKING INDUSTRY THAT IS ABLE TO TAKE COMMODITIES THAT ARE

22:04 DROPPED OFF IN THE EMIRATES AND SHIP THEM NORTHWEST UP THROUGH

22:08 JORDAN AND THE MEDITERRANEAN. YOU'RE WATCHING THE IMPORTANCE

22:14 OF GEOGRAPHY AND YOU ARE ALSO WATCHING WHY EVENTUALLY,

22:15 RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL ARE GOING TO BE SO IMPORTANT FOR THE

22:19 KINGDOM BECAUSE THAT GEOGRAPHY PROVIDES YOU WITH AN

22:23 ALTERNATIVE LAND GROUP TO GET AROUND RED SEA INTRODUCTIONS.

22:28 IF I HAD A BIG WORRY IN THE WORLD, IT IS THE INTERNET BEING

22:31 CUT IN THE RED SEA BUT STEPS ARE BEING DONE TO PROTECT THAT

22:35 BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE ARE GOING TO SEE CONTINUED

22:38 DISRUPTION AND SLOWNESS WITH SOME OF THE COMMODITY AND

22:40 ENERGY SHIPMENTS THROUGH THE AREA. ANNMARIE:

22:46 WHAT KIND OF CAMPAIGN RESPONSE COULD WE SEE SPECIFICALLY WITH

22:48 SECRETARY BLINKEN IN THE REGION? NORMAN:

22:53 THE SECRETARY IS GOING TO AIM FOR SEVERAL THINGS, FIRST FOR

22:56 CONTINUED HUMANITARIAN CHIP THAT'S AN EXPANDING THOSE INTO

22:57 GAZA. HE'S GOING TO LOOK FOR ANYTHING

23:01 THAT COULD BE DONE TO INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF HOSTAGE

23:03 RELEASES IN A CEASE FIRE. THAT WOULD SATISFY OUR

23:09 REQUIREMENTS, ARAB DEMANDS AND GIVE ISRAEL ITS PEOPLE WHO ARE

23:12 BEING TAKEN HOSTAGE. AT THE SAME TIME WE DON'T HAVE

23:19 A LOT OF PROGRESS IN TERMS OF WHAT DO YOU DO WITH HAMAS?

23:22 THEY REFUSE TO LEAVE AND THEY WANT TO STAY IN CHARGE.

23:27 IMAGINE A TWO STATE SOLUTION WHERE HAMAS RUNS THE

23:28 PALESTINIAN STATE. IMAGINE WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN

23:31 FOR SECURITY. YOU WOULD HAVE A FAILED STATE

23:35 IN THAT AREA. THIS IS ALL BEING WORKED

23:37 THROUGH, IT IS A VERY COMPLICATED SERIES OF

23:40 CONVERSATIONS AND THIS IS GOING TO TAKE A LOT LONGER THAN MANY

23:42 PEOPLE BELIEVE. JONATHAN: I'VE GOT SO MANY QUESTIONS

23:45 AFTER THIS CONVERSATION. NORMAN ROULE, FORMER SENIOR U.S.

23:49 INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL. LISA, I KNOW WHERE YOU WANT TO

23:52 GO. LISA: WHERE DID THIS COME FROM?

23:59 WE HAVEN'T BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS BUT THE INTERNET LINES

24:02 MIGHT BE CUT BETWEEN ASIA AND EUROPE?

24:03 IT JUST SHOWS ALL THE THINGS THAT WE HAVEN'T EVEN THOUGHT

24:06 ABOUT IN THIS CONFLICT AND HOW CRUCIAL THIS ONE AREA IS TO

24:09 TRADE AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS.

24:15 JONATHAN: HOW MANY MONTHS IS IT NOW?

24:16 THREE? LISA: MAYBE THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE ARE

24:20 FACTORING IN. JONATHAN: CRUDE LOWER THIS MORNING.

24:28 COMING UP THIS MORNING, THE CHIEF ECONOMIST OF OECD.

24:30 THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

24:45 JONATHAN: LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY, EQUITY

24:48 FEATURES NEGATIVE ON THE S&P 500, ON THE NASDAQ TOO.

24:55 ON THE NASDAQ WE ARE DOWN BY 0.1%, COMING OFF THE BACK OF

24:56 FOUR WEEKS OF GAINS. ALL-TIME HIGH AT THE CLOSE ON

24:59 FRIDAY. IN THE BOND MARKET, YIELDS

25:02 HIGHER. THE TWO YEAR UP BY TWO BASIS

25:06 POINTS. REALLY WEIRD WEEK LAST WEEK IN

25:11 THE BOND MARKET. THE REASON I SAY THAT IS IF YOU

25:16 GO TO WEDNESDAY'S PRICE ACTION, YOU'LL NOTICE THE YIELDS MOVE

25:18 LOWER EVEN THOUGH CHAIRMAN POWELL PUSHED BACK AND IT WAS

25:22 NOT JUST ABOUT THE FED AND DATA LAST WEEK, IT WAS ABOUT VANKE

25:23 TENSION. LISA: PEOPLE -- ABOUT BANK TENSION.

25:31 LISA: PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WOULD COST

25:32 SOME SORT OF SHIFT. JAY POWELL PUSHED BACK AGAINST

25:37 THAT. THIS IS ONE OF THE LESS TALKED

25:41 ABOUT ASPECTS OF HIS SPEECH OR HIS DISCUSSION ON 60 MINUTES.

25:45 HE BASICALLY SAID IS NOT AS A SYSTEMIC ISSUE -- SAID IT IS

25:47 NOT A SYSTEMIC ISSUE. JONATHAN: WE CAN MOVE ONTO THE NEXT ASSET

25:51 CLASS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE. HIGHLY INTUITIVE STUFF, YIELDS

25:55 ARE UP.

26:01 RIGHT NOW, EURO-DOLLAR, 107.56. -- 1.0756.

26:14 AN INTERVIEW ON 60 MINUTES WITH CBS, POWELL REITERATED HIS --

26:19 REITERATED THAT MARCH IS UNLIKELY, SAYING THE DANGER IS

26:22 MOVING TOO SOON AND THE REALLY GOOD READINGS WE HAVE HAD FOR

26:24 THE LAST SIX MONTHS SOMEHOW TURN OUT NOT TO BE A TRUE

26:27 INDICATOR OF WHERE INFLATION IS HEADING.

26:30 WE TALKED ABOUT THIS WEDNESDAY, THE DISCOMFORT AROUND THIS

26:32 STORY. LISA: ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT THEY GOT

26:37 IT WRONG WHEN IT CAME TO THE SURGE IN INFLATION.

26:41 THE DATA HAS BEEN ALMOST TOO GOOD.

26:43 WE HEARD THIS OVER THE WEEKEND. PETER SCHEER AT ACADEMY

26:46 SECURITIES PUT IT THIS WAY. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN

26:50 MONTHS I FELT THE NEED TO STEP BACK AND SEE IF I AM NOT GIVING

26:52 THE ECONOMY ENOUGH CREDIT. HE IS NOT ALONE.

26:57 HOW DO YOU FACTOR IN THE FACT

27:04 THAT THE CITI U U.S. ECONOMIC SURPRISE INDEX IS THE

27:05 HIGHEST IT'S EVER BEEN? JONATHAN:

27:13 A SIMPLY STUNNING JOBS REPORT, THE BANK OF AMERICA BLOWOUT

27:15 REPORT, SO MUCH FOR THE SOFT LANDING.

27:19 I THOUGHT OF HSBC AND I WENT BACK TO THIS NOTE IN EARLY

27:22 JANUARY, THE BIGGEST RISK IS NOT FROM A'S SUDDEN

27:24 DETERIORATION BUT ANOTHER REPRICING IN RATES -- IS NOT

27:30 FROM A SUDDEN DETERIORATION BUT ANOTHER REPRICING IN RATES.

27:33 LISA: WE HAVE TO WONDER IF IT CAN BE

27:34 EVERYTHING OTHER THAN META. JONATHAN:

27:38 LOOK TOWARDS SMALL CAPS. IS GOOD NEWS TRULY GOING TO BE

27:42 GOOD NEWS IF IT LEADS TO THAT REPRICING WE SAW? LISA:

27:44 THE ANSWER WAS NO. YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT WITH

27:51 73% OF THE RUSSELL 2000, 73% OF THOSE NAMES WERE LOWER.

27:53 JONATHAN: LET'S HEAD TO WASHINGTON.

27:57 SENATORS RELEASING A BIPARTISAN DEAL TO IMPOSE NEW IMMIGRATION

28:00 RESTRICTIONS AND UNLOCKED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN UKRAINE

28:02 AID. WITH THE BILL SET FOR A VOTE ON

28:06 WEDNESDAY, IT IS EXPECTED TO FACE BIGGER HURDLES IN THE

28:09 HOUSE WHERE MANY REPUBLICANS OPPOSE IT.

28:11 IS IT TRULY DEAD ON ARRIVAL? ANNMARIE:

28:15 IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN BECAUSE THERE ARE GOING TO BE

28:17 REPUBLICANS WHO LOOK AT THIS AND SAY WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING

28:19 IMMIGRATION POLICY AND PROVISIONS FOR DECADES AND

28:21 FINALLY THERE IS AN ENCOMPASSING BILL?

28:25 THIS BILL HAS SOMETHING IN IT FOR EVERYONE.

28:28 $60 BILLION FOR UKRAINE, $20 BILLION FOR THE BORDER.

28:32 THAT IS $6 BILLION MORE THAN BIDEN ASKED FOR AND THEN $10

28:34 BILLION FOR ISRAEL. THE ISSUE IS IT IS AN ELECTION

28:37 YEAR. NOT JUST THAT YOU HAVE POLICY

28:40 ISSUES SOME REPUBLICANS DON'T WANT TO VOTE ON.

28:43 THEY DON'T THINK IT GOES HARD ENOUGH ON THE BORDER.

28:45 YOU HAVE THE FORMER PRESIDENT BREATHING DOWN THEIR NECK, NOT

28:48 TO GIVE JOE BIDEN A WIN. JONATHAN:

28:50 THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE HATE ABOUT POLITICS.

28:55 IS THIS THAT ON ARRIVAL BECAUSE OF SUBSTANCE POLICY TO YOUR

28:56 POINT OR DEAD ON ARRIVAL BECAUSE THEY WANT TO PRESERVE

28:58 THE ISSUE FOR THE FORMER PRESIDENT TO RUN ON? LISA:

29:03 HOW DO YOU PARSE THE TWO? YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE

29:08 DISAGREEING, YOU'VE GOT CIVIL WAR WITHIN THE GOP AND THE

29:10 DEMOCRATS WHO THINK IT IS TOO HARD.

29:14 YOU LOOK AT THIS AND THINK WHAT IS THE PATH TO GETTING IT DONE?

29:16 MIKE JOHNSON WHO PEOPLE ARE QUESTIONING WHETHER HE CAN

29:19 REMAIN IN THAT POSITION AS HOUSE SPEAKER AT A TIME WHEN HE

29:20 IS TRYING TO WRANGLE CATS. ANNMARIE:

29:24 HE IS WRINKLING CATS WHEN IT COMES TO THE HOUSE GOP CAUCUS.

29:27 WE ALSO HAVE TO REMEMBER THEY ARE PUTTING THEIR OWN BILL IN

29:29 THE FLOOR THIS WEEK FOR A CLEAN ISRAEL DEAL.

29:34 THERE IS GOING TO BE A LOT OF TWISTING AND TANGLING GOING ON

29:36 IN CONGRESS. JONATHAN: LET'S GET TO CATERPILLAR

29:39 EARNINGS. JUST NOW. WE WILL RUN IT THROUGH THE

29:43 TOPLINE AND BOTTOM-LINE.

29:49 THERE IS AN UPSIDE TO PRICE FOR YOU. REVENUE COMING IN BASICALLY

29:52 IN-LINE. LISA: THIS GOES TO THE QUESTION OF

29:58 WHAT IS GOING TO GO TO WHAT? THE SERVICE SECTOR, AS A GOING

30:01 TO COME DOWN TO MANUFACTURING OR WHEN YOU FACTORING GOING UP

30:02 TO SERVICES? CATERPILLAR, THE BELLWETHER ON

30:11 FARM EQUIPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION, REALLY HIGHLIGHTS

30:13 JUST HOW MUCH WE ARE SEEING A RESURGENCE IN SOME OF THESE

30:15 INDUSTRIES. JONATHAN: WE WILL TRY AND COME BACK TO

30:18 THE AND THE NEXT HOUR OR SO. LET'S GET STRAIGHT TO IT.

30:24 IN NEW JERSEY,, WINNING THE RIGHTS TO HOST THE FIFA WORLD

30:30 CUP FINAL IN 2026, BEATING BIDS FROM DALLAS AND LOS ANGELES.

30:35 140 MATCHES IN THE METLIFE STADIUM FINAL WITH THE

30:38 TOURNAMENT, THE FIRST TO FEATURE 48 TEAMS. DALLAS AND

30:42 LOS ANGELES WILL HOST SEMIFINALS.

30:44 WE ARE ALL EXCITED FOR THIS AROUND THE TABLE.

30:47 THERE WAS SOME CONTROVERSY ABOUT IT BEING REFERRED TO AS

30:51 NEW YORK. LISA: IT IS THE GREATER NEW YORK AREA.

30:56 IF YOU'RE TRYING TO ATTRACT AN INTERNATIONAL AUDIENCE, NO

30:57 OFFENSE TO ANYONE FROM NEW JERSEY. ANNMARIE: BUT. JONATHAN:

30:59 HERE WE GO. ANNMARIE: DO YOU WANT TO GO VISIT NEW

31:04 JERSEY FOR THE FIFA WORLD CUP FINAL OR NEW YORK CITY?

31:06 THEY WILL SAY NEW YORK CITY. I AM REQUESTING JULY 20 OFF.

31:12 LISA: HOW MUCH ARE THESE TICKETS GOING TO BE? JONATHAN:

31:16 HOW ANY PEOPLE WATCHED THE SUPER BOWL ON TV?

31:19 MORE THAN 110 MILLION? 1.5 BILLION FOR THE WORLD CUP

31:24 FINAL RETURN 22. -- FOR 2022. NEW YORK IS EXPENSIVE TO WATCH

31:29 A SPORT. I CANNOT IMAGINE HOW MUCH IT

31:32 WILL COST TO WATCH THE WORLD CUP FINAL. LISA:

31:37 A MEMBER OF A HOUSEHOLD ASKED

31:43 FOR IT AS A GRADUATION PRESENT AND I SHUT THAT DOWN. ANNMARIE:

31:46 IT IS THE GREATER NEW YORK AREA. JONATHAN:

31:48 I KIND COUNTS AS NEW YORK. I THINK FIFA CAN'T REFER TO IT

31:51 AS THE METLIFE STADIUM. IT HAS TO BE THE NEW YORK-NEW

31:54 JERSEY STADIUM. GOVERNOR MURPHY WILL BE HAPPY

31:58 BECAUSE HE WAS THE AMBASSADOR TO GERMANY ALL OF THOSE YEARS

31:59 AGO. I THINK THEY ARE A GENUINE FOOTBALL FAN.

32:05 LISA: I LOVE HOW YOU KNOW ALL

32:11 POLITICIANS' SPORTS TEAMS. JONATHAN:

32:12 IF THAT IS NOT RIGHT GOVERNOR, PLEASE CORRECT ME AND WE WILL

32:15 CORRECT IT ON AIR.

32:21 THE OECD PROJECTING GROWTH DOWN FROM 3.1% LAST YEAR, WRITING

32:27 RECENT INDICATORS POINT TO SOME MODERATION OF GROWTH WITH THE

32:29 EFFECTS OF TIGHTER FINANCIAL CONDITIONS CONTINUING TO APPEAR

32:31 IN CREDIT AND HOUSING MARKETS AND GLOBAL TRADE REMAINING

32:32 SUBDUED. ALONGSIDE US IS CLARE LOMBARDELLI, CHIEF ECONOMIST AT

32:36 THE OECD. THANKS FOR BEING WITH US.

32:41 WHAT IS HOLDING US BACK? WHAT REGION IS IT?

32:44 IS IT ASIA OR EUROPE? WHAT IS IT RIGHT NOW? CLARE:

32:51 WE ARE SEEING A MIXED PICTURE AROUND THE WORLD.

32:55 THE EUROPEAN ECONOMY IS UP -- IS A BIT WEAKER BECAUSE OF THE

32:58 TIGHTENING MONETARY CONDITIONS WE ARE SEEING, IN PARTICULAR

33:01 WEIGHING ON ACTIVITY. ALSO AS YOU SAY, CHINA, WE

33:07 PROTECT GROWTH OF JUST UNDER 5%. THAT IS RELATIVELY HIGH

33:13 COMPARED TO SOME ADVANCED COUNTRIES BUT IT IS LESS THAN

33:14 SOME PEOPLE HOPED FOR. IT IS LESS THAN WE ARE SEEING

33:20 FROM CHINA IN THE PAST. IN CONTRAST WE HAVE GOT A STRONGER

33:23 PICTURE IN THE U.S., U.S. DATA HAS BEEN LOOKING BETTER.

33:29 SHOWING SOME STRONG GROWTH. LISA:

33:37 HOW MUCH ARE THE RED SEA ISSUES -- WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT

33:39 ALL MORNING -- HOW MUCH OF IT IS WEIGHING ON THE GLOBAL

33:40 OUTLOOK? DO YOU THINK MARKETS ARE

33:43 UNDERPRICING HOW SIGNIFICANT THAT COULD BE? CLARE:

33:48 WE ARE NOT SEEING AND HAVE A BIG IMPACT IN THE GLOBAL

33:49 OUTLOOK AT THE MOMENT. WE HAVE SEEN A RISE IN SHIPPING

33:58 COSTS BUT WE ARE NOT SEEING IT FEEDING ENERGY PRICES AND THE

34:02 LESS SHIPPING CAUSES ARE MAINTAINED AT HIGH LEVELS, WE

34:05 DON'T EXPECT IT TO HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON INFLATION.

34:10 FOR OUR CENTRAL SCENARIOS, WE DON'T ANTICIPATE A LARGER

34:11 IMPACT BUT IT IS CERTAINLY A RISK I WANT TO KEEP ANE Y -- AN

34:15 EYE ON. ANNMARIE: HOW MUCH ARE YOU SEEING THIS

34:22 DIVERGENCE BETWEEN EUROPE STAGFLATION AND U.S.

34:28 EXCEPTIONALISM? CLARE:

34:30 WE ARE SEEING A DIFFERENCE IN OUTLOOK AS YOU SAY, SO THE

34:32 GROWTH POSITION IN EUROPE IS WEAKER.

34:34 WE HAVE SEEN STRONGER GROWTH IN THE U.S..

34:39 A MUCH BIGGER HIT ON INFLATION BECAUSE OF THEIR EXPOSURE

34:44 THROUGH THE ENERGY PRICE.

34:47 THE GROWTH OUTLOOK IS A BIT WEAKER.

34:51 INCLUDING BECAUSE OF AN AGING WORKFORCE IN THE AREA AS WELL,

34:54 COMPARED TO THE U.S.. JONATHAN: YOU MIGHT EXPECT SOME

35:00 CONVERSATION ON THE SIDE OF THE WORLD ABOUT THE ELECTION TAKING

35:01 PLACE AT THE END OF THE YEAR. SOME CONVERSATION ABOUT FORMER

35:05 PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S PLANS IF HE SECURES THE WHITE HOUSE.

35:10 THERE WAS DISCUSSION OF A BLANKET 60% TARIFF ON CHINESE

35:15 IMPORTS. HAVE YOU WONDERED WHAT THAT

35:18 WOULD DO TO INFLATION IN AMERICA ?

35:20 WHAT IS THE EXPERIENCE OF 2018 WHEN WE START IT RAMP UP

35:24 TARIFFS -- STARTED TO RAMP UP TARIFFS? CLARE:

35:30 WE HAVE NOT MODELED ANY PARTICULAR AREA IN THE SPACE

35:32 BUT WE DO LOOK AT DETAILED DATA ON TRADE AND WHAT WE HAVE SEEN,

35:35 IT IS A CONCERNING TREND FOR THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, A REDUCTION

35:38 IN THE TRADE INTEGRATION.

35:44 FOR A LONG PERIOD WE SAW TRADE INCREASING, WE SAW INTEGRATION

35:47 OF GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS, NOT DELIVERING WIDER CHOICES TO

35:49 CONSUMERS. WE HAVE SEEN THAT TREND

35:54 REVERSED FOR A WHOLE RANGE OF REASONS.

35:58 THAT COMES AT A COST IN TERMS OF PRODUCTIVITY AND PRICING FOR

35:59 PEOPLE.

36:05 WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE TRADE CONTINUING, INCREASED TRADE ON

36:10 A WORLD'S BASED FIRST SYSTEM. ANNMARIE: -- LISA:

36:17 HOW DO YOU MODEL OUT FORECASTS DEPENDING ON WHO IS IN POWER?

36:18 HOW MUCH ARE YOU TRYING TO GET YOUR HEAD AROUND WHAT THE

36:25 POTENTIAL DOWNSIDE WOULD BE TO GLOBAL TRADE, GIVEN ONE

36:27 SCENARIO VERSUS ANOTHER? ARE YOU MAKING THOSE MODELS?

36:32 CLARE: WHAT WE DO IS WE TAKE CURRENT

36:39 PLANS AND CURRENT ADMINISTRATION PLANS FOR WHEN

36:42 WE ARE CONSTRUCTING OUR FORECASTS AROUND THE WORLD AND

36:43 WE BASE THEM ON THOSE EXPECTATIONS. JONATHAN:

36:45 WE APPRECIATE THE CLARITY. IT IS GOOD TO HEAR FROM YOU.

36:49 CLARE LOMBARDELLI OF THE OECD. ANNMARIE, I DON'T SEE HOW YOU

36:54 COULD HAVE AN OUTLOOK FOR 2025 RIGHT NOW ON INFLATION, ON

37:01 GROWTH, WITHOUT THE CLARITY OF WHAT POLICY IS GOING TO LOOK

37:02 LIKE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. IF WE ARE SERIOUSLY HAVING A

37:06 CONVERSATION BETWEEN MAINTAINING THE CURRENT STANCE

37:09 ON CHINA, WHICH IS TARIFFS BUT NOT INCREASING, THAT IS OPTION

37:10 ONE. OPTION TWO, GOING FORWARD WITH

37:16 A BLANKET 60% PLUS TARIFF ON CHINESE IMPORTS.

37:17 YOU WILL HAVE A RADICALLY DIFFERENT OUTLOOK ON BOTH

37:19 GROWTH AND INFLATION. ANNMARIE: AND NOT JUST 60% BLANKET

37:22 TARIFFS ON CHINA. ALSO A POTENTIAL 10% TARIFF

37:28 WALL, INVISIBLE WALL AS THEY DESCRIBE IT, OF ALL IMPORTS

37:32 INTO THE UNITED STATES. THAT IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN

37:37 WHAT WE WOULD SEE WITH ANOTHER BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. JONATHAN:

37:41 EVERY OUTLOOK NEEDS THAT ASTERISK. IT NEEDS THAT CAVEAT.

37:46 THESE ARE OUR BASIC ASSUMPTIONS, CONTINUATION OF

37:48 WHAT WE HAVE SEEN COMING OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE BECAUSE WHEN

37:51 YOU START PULLING -- PUTTING IN DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES, YOU GET

37:52 A VERY DIFFERENT OUTLOOK. LISA: WHAT DID LORI SAY EARLIER?

38:01 EVERY OUTLOOK NEEDS TO HAVE A 16% CONVICTION RATE?

38:06 MODELS SHOWING THE DIFFERENTIAL, ARE PEOPLE

38:08 STARTING TO DRAW THOSE UP?

38:15 HOW MUCH ARE THE TARIFFS -- ARE THEY JUST BEING USED NOW AS

38:16 LEVERAGE? WHEN HE GOES TO THE TABLE AS HE

38:20 LIKES TO SAY, HE LIKES TO HAVE LEVERAGE AND WE HAVE SEEN HIM

38:22 USE TARIFFS AS LEVERAGE IN THE PAST. JONATHAN:

38:26 SOME OF THE MOVES WE HAVE SEEN IN CHINA, PLENTY OF REASONS FOR

38:30 THOSE MOVES BUT SOME OF THOSE MOVES HAVE BEEN PRETTY WILD.

38:32 LISA: A LOT OF THIS HAS TO DO WITH

38:34 U.S. BUSINESSES WITHDRAWING A LOT OF

38:37 ACTIVITY, TRYING TO MOVE WHERE THE MANUFACTURING HAPPENS.

38:39 THIS WILL ONLY ACCELERATE IT. IF YOU ARE A BUSINESS TRY TO

38:42 COME UP WITH THE PLAN, REGARDLESS OF WHAT ACTUALLY

38:47 ENDS UP GETTING PAST, HOW DO YOU HAVE ANY CONVICTION TO GO

38:49 INVEST IN CHINA, GIVEN THIS UNCERTAINTY WITH THE POLITICAL

38:51 SPHERE? JONATHAN: IN SOME CASES YOU JUST HAVE TO

38:54 WAIT. THAT IS THE LATEST. MORE IN A

38:57 MOMENT. LET'S GET YOU AN UPDATE. HERE IS YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF

39:02 WITH YAHAIRA JACQUEZ. YAHAIRA: VLADIMIR PUTIN IS EXPECTED TO

39:06 VISIT TURKEY NEXT WEEK. HIS FIRST TRIP TO A NATO MEMBER

39:10 COUNTRY SINCE HE ORDERED THE INVASION OF UKRAINE TWO YEARS

39:11 AGO. MEETINGS WITH TURKISH PRESIDENT

39:13 ERDOGAN ARE EXPECTED TO FOCUS ON ENERGY COOPERATION AND

39:17 SECURITY IN SYRIA. THE WAR IN UKRAINE WILL LIKELY

39:20 ALSO BE ON THE AGENDA.

39:29 PUTIN'S TRIPS ABROAD HAVE BEEN LIMITED, DUE TO THE RISK OF

39:31 ARREST FOR INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES.

39:39 KKR'S CO-CEO AND -- WERE ELECTED SUNDAY AS THE

39:41 UNIVERSITY CONTINUES TO FACE INTENSE CRITICISM FROM ALUMNI,

39:44 LAWMAKERS AND FACULTY. HARVARD'S INTERIM PRESIDENT

39:51 SAID QUOTE, THEY SHARE A COMMITMENT TO ACADEMIC FREEDOM,

39:53 INCLUSION AND THE STUDENT -- AND THE PURSUIT OF EXCELLENCE

39:56 IN HARVARD'S MISSION OF TEACHING AND RESEARCH.

40:00 TAYLOR SWIFT BROKE ANOTHER RECORD, WINNING ALBUM OF THE

40:01 YEAR FOR THE FOURTH TIME AT THE GRAMMYS.

40:07 SWIFT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN TIED WITH FRANK SINATRA, PAUL SIMON

40:08 AND STEVIE WONDER FOR THE MOST WINS IN THE CATEGORY.

40:12 THE GRAMMYS ALSO WERE A BIG NIGHT FOR FEMALE ACTS, WHO

40:15 SWEPT ALL FOUR OF THE TOP PRIZES.

40:16 THAT IS YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF. JONATHAN: YAHAIRA, THANK YOU.

40:23 UP NEXT, THE SENATE BIPARTISAN BILL UNVEILED.

40:26 >> I AM REALLY PROUD AND PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE THAT

40:29 DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE HAVE COME TO AN

40:33 AGREEMENT ON A BIPARTISAN SUPPLEMENTAL BILL. JONATHAN:

40:36 IS THAT AGREEMENT DEAD ON ARRIVAL?

40:38 THAT QUESTION GETS ANSWERED UP NEXT. ♪

40:57 JONATHAN: EQUITIES THIS MORNING, SLIGHTLY

41:00 SOFTER. BOND YIELDS HIGHER ON THE 10

41:03 YEAR, UP SIX BASIS POINTS. ALMOST 4.4% ON THE TWO YEAR.

41:10 UNDER SURVEILLANCE THIS MORNING, THE SENATE BIPARTISAN

41:11 BILL UNVEILED.

41:15 >> I AM REALLY PROUD AND PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE THE

41:19 DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE HAVE COME TO AN

41:22 AGREEMENT ON A BIPARTISAN SUPPLEMENTAL BILL TONIGHT.

41:24 UKRAINE WOULD BE RUN OVER BY PUTIN IF WE DON'T GET AID IN

41:28 THIS BILL. ISRAEL NEEDS TO DEFEND ITSELF

41:30 AGAINST HAMAS WITH THE AID IN THIS BILL.

41:33 WE FIX THE BORDER PROBLEM IN THIS BILL. JONATHAN: DO WE?

41:36 THAT IS THE QUESTION. AFTER MONTHS OF CLOSED-DOOR

41:41 NEGOTIATIONS, THE SENATE UNVEILING A $118 BILLION

41:46 BIPARTISAN DEAL TO SECURE THE U.S.-MEXICO BORDER.

41:49 THE BUILT OUT A BY PRESIDENT BIDEN AND SENATORS ON BOTH

41:52 SIDES OF THE AISLE, FACING MAJOR OPPOSITION FROM

41:54 REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE, WHERE IT IS HEADED THIS WEEK.

41:56 ANNMARIE: HOW SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON SAYS

41:57 IT IS DEAD ON ARRIVAL. HE TOOK A TWITTER LAST AND SAID

42:03 THIS IS -- THIS BILL IS ASKED -- THIS BILL IS WORSE THAN WE

42:05 EXPECTED AND WILL NOT COME CLOSE TO ENDING THE ORDER

42:07 CRISIS. IF THIS BILL REACHES THE HOUSE,

42:13 IT'LL BE DEAD ON ARRIVAL. JONATHAN:

42:16 THE FOUNDER OF PANGAEA POLICY JOINS US WITH MORE.

42:20 IS IT TRULY DEAD ON ARRIVAL?

42:22 >> NOT AT ALL. NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT.

42:25 NOT EVEN MOSTLY DEAD. MY FAVORITE MOVIE, THE PRINCES

42:28 BY WOULD SAY. -- THE PRINCESS BRIDE WOULD SAY.

42:33 THEY ARE SAYING IT IS THAT ON ARRIVAL BECAUSE THEY PREFER

42:35 THEIR OWN BILL.

42:44 WHAT WILL END UP HAPPENING IS IF THE SENATE CAN PASS ITS OWN

42:50 BILL AND I DON'T WANT TO GO AGAINST LORI OR LISA, BUT I

42:54 WOULD SAY 60% THEY DO THAT. AND THEN THEY END UP IN

42:58 CONFERENCE AIMED A HOUSE COULD MAKE ITS CASE THAT WHAT IT

43:02 WANTS IS BETTER THAN WHAT THE SENATE ALREADY HAS.

43:09 THE MOMENTUM HERE IS MUCH TOWARDS A STRONG BILL,

43:13 CERTAINLY BIDEN WANTS THAT AND REPUBLICANS WANT IT.

43:17 AS ANNMARIE POINTED OUT, THIS IS THEIR BIG CHANCE.

43:20 IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THIS ENDS UP HAPPENING.

43:24 ANNMARIE: DO YOU THINK HOUSE REPUBLICANS

43:26 WILL CAPITULATE TO THE FORMER PRESIDENT WHO DOESN'T WANT TO

43:28 SEE A DEAL IN THIS ELECTION YEAR? TERRY:

43:33 I THINK TRUMP IS FAR LESS IMPORTANT IN THIS SENSE THAN

43:36 PEOPLE GIVE CREDIT FOR. I WAS LOOK AT MOTIVATIONS.

43:44 I THINK THE MOTIVATIONS HERE ARE FOR BIDEN AND REPUBLICANS

43:46 ALIKE, VERY STRONG. THE FUNDAMENTAL MOTIVATION OF A

43:51 REPUBLICAN MEMBER OF CONGRESS OR ANY MEMBER OF CONGRESS IS TO

43:52 GET REELECTED. SECONDLY, THEY ARE MOST

43:57 INTERESTED IN MAINTAINING OR FLIPPING TO A MAJORITY.

43:59 AFTER THAT, WE WILL START TALKING ABOUT THE PRESIDENT.

44:05 IF THEY CAN END UP WITH A BILL THAT FROM A HOUSE PERSPECTIVE,

44:07 THAT IS A LITTLE BIT STRONGER THAN THE SENATE BILL, THEY CAN

44:10 TAKE CREDIT FOR MAKING IT SO. THEY WILL DO THAT IN A

44:12 HEARTBEAT. ANNMARIE: PROBABLY SAVOR FOR THEM TO GET

44:17 IT DONE SOONER RATHER THAN LATER GIVEN THE FACT OF THE

44:18 ELECTION IS IN NOVEMBER. WHAT IS THE TIMELINE YOU SEE

44:20 FOR THE SUPPLEMENTAL? TERRY: WORK EXPANDS TO FILL THE TIME.

44:27 THESE FOLKS HAVE ALREADY SHOWN A GREAT DEAL OF FLEXIBILITY IN

44:29 THAT. LOOK AT HOW LONG IT HAS TAKEN

44:34 THEM TO NOT COME UP WITH A FINAL SPENDING BILL, AT LEAST

44:37 FOUR OR FIVE MONTHS NOW. I THINK THIS PROBABLY GOES

44:44 UNTIL MID-MARCH, AND THEN THEY PROBABLY WRAP UP A LOT OF THE

44:46 STUFF THAT SEEMS TO BE THE WINDOW THEY THINK IS THE ONE

44:49 THEY WANT. I WILL TAKE THEM AT THEIR WORD.

44:55 LISA: IF TRUMP FOR HIM AT LEE OPPOSES

44:58 THIS AND HE IS LEADING IN THE POLLS, HOW MUCH DOES THAT

45:01 CURTAIL ITS POSSIBILITY OF GETTING PAST? TERRY:

45:05 I DON'T THINK A LOT, FRANKLY BECAUSE WHAT WILL END UP

45:13 HAPPENING IS THE TRUMP RHETORIC AND THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN AND

45:18 CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN REALITY OF WANTING A BILL THAT IS

45:24 STRONGER THAN WHAT THE SENATE'S ALREADY PROPOSED AND MAKING

45:28 BITE INSIDE THAT -- BIDEN SIGN THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT MATTER

45:31 FOR THEM AND SOMETHING THEY WANT.

45:34 THAT IS SOMETHING TRUMP FRANKLY WILL BE INTERESTED IN TAKING

45:35 CREDIT FOR. IN THE END, THOSE INTERESTS

45:38 DOVETAIL.

45:44 I WOULD LOOK FOR BIDEN AND CENTRIST DEMOCRATS TO TRY AND

45:47 SHUT DOWN THE LEFT ON THIS, WHICH THEY HAVE NOT DONE YET.

45:51 LISA: WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MIKE

45:57 JOHNSON'S POSSIBILITY AS STAYING SPEAKER THROUGH THIS

45:58 ELECTION CYCLE? TERRY: I THINK JOHNSON PROBABLY DOES

46:01 NOT END UP STAYING.

46:07 THE REASON FOR THAT IS FIRSTLY, REPUBLICANS CAN ILL AFFORD

46:10 ANOTHER CIRCUS, EVEN AFTER ALL THIS.

46:13 THEY HOLD MORE CONFIDENCE WITH THE PUBLIC THAN BIDEN ON ISSUES

46:17 LIKE THE ECONOMY, IMMIGRATION. I THINK THEY WANT TO DO THAT.

46:23 SECONDLY, I'VE ALWAYS LOOKED AT

46:29 THE CAT HERDING AS GETTING SOMETHING ON THE BOARD OF HIS

46:32 STRONG INDEFENSIBLE IN WHICH JOHNSON CAN THEN USE TO SAY OK,

46:38 LET'S -- WE'VE GOTTEN OUR BIG WIN, LET'S WRAP UP SPENDING

46:40 WITH SOME MODEST HAIRCUTS. CALL IT A DAY ON THAT.

46:46 THEY WILL GRUMBLE BUT THEY WILL GO FORWARD. LISA:

46:51 YUSOR THE CONVERSATION BY SAYING SPEAKER JOHNSON IS

46:55 CALLING THIS DEAD ON ARRIVAL

46:57 BECAUSE IT IS NOT THE HR2 THAT HOUSE REMOTE -- HOUSE

47:00 REPUBLICANS WANT. WHAT ARE THEY WANT TO SEE TWO

47:03 PEOPLE TO SIGN THEIR NAME ON THIS BILL? TERRY:

47:08 IDEALLY, ONE OBVIOUS THING, THEY WANT HR2.

47:16 IT IS THE HOUSE'S JOB TO GET OUT AND GO TOO FAR WITH THE

47:17 IDEA. THE SENATE RAINS THINGS BACK

47:22 IN, AND CONFERENCE. OUTSIDE OF THAT, THE THING I

47:28 WOULD LOOK AT THE MOST IS THE IDEA THAT THE BORDER IS STILL

47:34 SOMEHOW POROUS IN SOME WAY.

47:40 THE IDEA THAT THE BORDER CAN BE SHUT DOWN FOR A PERIOD OF TIME

47:45 WHILE THINGS GET TOGETHER I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THEM.

47:52 THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I HEARD SENATOR SINEMA TALK ABOUT

47:53 YESTERDAY. THEY WILL CERTAINLY WANT TO

47:56 SURE THAT UP BEFORE THEY FINALIZE ANYTHING. JONATHAN:

47:59 45 SECONDS LEFT. THE SUPER BOWL. MASSIVE TELEVISION AUDIENCE.

48:07 WHY WOULD THE PRESIDENT TURNED DOWN A PRE-SUPER BOWL INTERVIEW?

48:10 TERRY: THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. NOT ONE THAT I CAN ANSWER.

48:18 IT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BECOME A STANDARD APPEARANCE AND ONE

48:27 IN WHICH THE ABSENCE, FRANKLY IS IN EXPENDABLE AND AN X

48:33 BOOKABLE -- FRANKLY IS INEXPLICABLE. JONATHAN:

48:39 COMING OUT THE BACK OF A JOBS REPORT WHICH SAW MORE THAN

48:42 300,000 JOBS, TWO YEARS OF UNAPPOINTED BELOW 4%.

48:46 MR. PRESIDENT, HOW ARE YOU PREPARING FOR THE GAME?

48:52 YOU CAN LITERALLY SAY ANYTHING YOU WANT AND SQUEEZING WHATEVER

48:54 YOU WANT TO SAY ABOUT THE LABOR MARKET. ANNMARIE:

49:01 115 MILLION VIEWERS WERE WATCHING THE SUPER BOWL LAST

49:02 YEAR AND THAT'S WITHOUT TAYLOR SWIFT.

49:06 WHEN I ASKED THE CAMPAIGN OVER THE WE CAN, THEY SAID IT IS

49:09 EARLY IN THE CYCLE, IT IS POLITICAL EXHAUSTION.

49:10 THEY HAVE UNTIL NEXT WEEK. JONATHAN:

49:13 THEY DON'T KNOW HOW MANY EYES

49:19 ARE ON THE SCREEN, MAKING CHILI AND PUTTING BEER IN THE COOLER.

49:26 COMING UP NEXT, SALLIE

49:42 >> THE NEXT SEVEN HAS BEEN THE JOB.

49:46 >> LOOKING AT THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, THEY ARE IN A DIFFERENT

49:53 STRATOSPHERE.

49:54 >> AND WE LOOK AT THE MAGNIFICENT OVEN -- >> THAT

49:59 WILL BE LOSERS AND WINNERS, SO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW WHAT

50:00 YOU ARE BUYING.

50:05 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE. JONATHAN:

50:11 KICKING OFF THE TRADING WEEK WITH ALL-TIME HIGHS.

50:15 LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY, GOOD MORNING.

50:18 ALONGSIDE LISA ABRAMOWICZ ALONG WITH ANNE-MARIE.

50:25 PULLING BACK ON THE S&P 500.

50:31 IN -- WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE FEDERAL RESERVE.

50:36 I THINK WE HAVE TO BEGIN WITH META-.

50:40 ALMOST 200 BILLION DOLLARS, JUST AMAZING.

50:47 LISA: IT RAISES THE QUESTION, IS THIS

50:51 STRENGTH OR FRAGILITY FREE MARKET THAT HAS HINGED ON A

50:54 SMALL CODGER?

51:09 IT IS IN ITS OWN STRATOSPHERE BUT THERE IS A QUESTION OF IS

51:12 THERE A LOT OF RATES 70?

51:21 THEY ARE REALLY NOT HANGING IN THERE AND REALLY SHOWING LOSSES.

51:31 JONATHAN: HOW CLOSE ARE WE TO THINGS

51:38 CHANGING?

51:39 THAT WAS NOT A ONE OFF IN TERMS OF AN UPSIDE SURPRISE.

51:46 >> I SAW A NOTE SAYING THAT THIS GAVE PEOPLE MORE

51:49 CONVICTION OF THE LANDING. AND THEN YOU HAD OTHER PEOPLE

51:55 SAYING IT MADE LOOK AT -- AND MAKE THINGS LOOK WORSE.

52:01 STEARIC KAISER SAYING, POP QUIZ, WHAT DO YOU THINK IT WILL

52:02 BE? YOU GET ALL SORTS OF VIEWS.

52:16 JONATHAN: HOW MUCH CONVICTION DO YOU HAVE?

52:22 ANNMARIE: THIS BILL THAT WE HAVE BEEN

52:26 HEARING ABOUT FOR MONTHS, 118 BILLION ON THE TOP LINE.

52:32 20 BILLION FOR THE BORDER.

52:39 TERRY HAYNES SAYS IT IS DEAD ON ARRIVAL BUT IF THEY ARE GOING

52:41 TO GO TO CONFERENCE AND HAMMER IT OUT, POTENTIALLY THERE IS

52:47 SOMETHING THAT CAN GET HAMMERED OUT. JONATHAN:

52:52 IS IT DEAD ON ARRIVAL BECAUSE IT DOES NOT GO FAR ENOUGH

52:55 BECAUSE THE FORMER WANTS TO RUN ON THE ISSUE? ANNMARIE:

53:02 THE CLOSER TO NOVEMBER, TRUMP WILL BE BREATHING DOWN.

53:09 HANDLING IMMIGRATION AT THE BORDER GREATER THAN 30 POINTS.

53:12 THIS IS A HUGE ELECTION ISSUE. JONATHAN:

53:18 LOOK OUT FOR THAT CONVERSATION LATER.

53:25 EQUITY FUTURES PULLING BACK A LITTLE BIT.

53:28 TREASURY YIELDS LOWER AND TRADE ARE UP.

53:35 CLEARLY I WITH YIELDS HIGHER BY SEVEN BASIS POINTS.

53:42 LISA: IT SHOWED THAT THEY HAD A LATE

53:44 THE APPROACH. IF HE WAS NOT TALKING ABOUT A

53:51 CUT BEFORE THAT, THEN YOU HAVE A QUESTION OF WHAT WOULD HIS

53:56 RESPONSE TO CONCERNS THAT THEY ARE A LITTLE BIT WRONG?

54:02 JONATHAN: THE EURO NEGATIVE 0.3%.

54:10 COMING UP THIS HOUR, IF YOU HAVE NOT DONE ANY RESEARCH, THE

54:14 FED PATH FORWARD.

54:20 ALEXANDER ON ANOTHER FEAR OF A BANKING CRISIS.

54:23 HERE WE GO AGAIN, MAYBE. SENDING EQUITIES TO FRESH

54:29 RECORD HIGHS. THINKING THAT STOCKS HAVE MORE

54:34 ROOM TO RUN. THE S&P 500 PRICE TARGET OF

54:40 5400 BY YEAR-END.

54:47 JUST EIGHT STOCKS ACCOUNT FOR ONE FOURTH OF THE S&P 500'S

54:48 CAPITALIZATION. OUR FORECASTS ASSUME THAT IT

54:53 WILL CONTINUE TO LATE THE PROFIT MARGIN AND VALUATION.

55:01 ED, LET'S GET STRAIGHT TO IT. GREAT CATCH UP.

55:08 WHAT HAS THE CONTRIBUTION BEEN TO EARNINGS LAST QUARTER OVER

55:11 THE LAST YEAR?

55:18 ED: IT ACCOUNTED FOR SOMETHING LIKE

55:21 27%.

55:29 18% OF THE FORWARD REVENUES EARNINGS.

55:32 SOMETHING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF 10% OF REVENUES, SO THEY ARE

55:36 BIG. JONATHAN:

55:42 IS THERE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THIS BROADENS OUT SOON?

55:48 ED: THERE ARE A LOT OF REASONS TO

55:52 BELIEVE.

56:04 THE S&P 400 AND 600 ARSON MAKE 14 50.

56:08 THE S&P 500 IN THE MAKING CAP EIGHT ARE CLOSE TO 30. LISA:

56:16 INCREASING THE FORECAST ON THE S&P 500.

56:21 YOU HAVE MORE CONVICTION YOUR CALLS IF YOU HAVE A HIGHER

56:30 TARGET?

56:31 >> WE MAY GET THERE SOONER. I WAS THINKING 4600 BY THE

56:37 YEARS AND WE GOT THERE BY JULY OF LAST YEAR.

56:41 IT IS EXTREMELY POWERFUL TO THE UPSIDE. LISA:

56:45 HAVE YOU ANY YOUR FORECASTS?

56:50 >> I DO NOT THINK I HAVE TO. I THINK I AM NO AN OUTLIER.

56:58 BUT IT CERTAINLY SIGNALS THAT I REMAIN BULLISH THROUGH NEXT

57:00 YEAR. JONATHAN:

57:08 SOME PEOPLE JUST NATURALLY GRAVITATE TOWARD -- TOWARDS

57:10 PESSIMISM, BUT PEOPLE ARE ASKING THIS QUESTION.

57:15 WHY DON'T YOU BELIEVE THAT NUMBERS LIKE FRIDAY DERAILED

57:16 THE HOPES OF A SOFT LANDING?

57:23 ED: THE PRODUCTIVITY DURING THE LAST THREE QUARTERS OF LAST

57:26 YEAR WERE EXTRAORDINARILY STRONG.

57:31 I THINK WE ARE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF A PRODUCTIVITY BOOM.

57:38 THAT WAS A STRONG EMPLOYMENT NUMBER, THAT PEOPLE IGNORED THE

57:40 FACT THAT THE WEEKLY AVERAGE WAS DOWN 0.6%.

57:53 WHEN YOU ADD IN THAT WAGES WERE 0.6, WAGES AND SALARIES BE ON

57:58 COURSE DURING LAST MONTH. THE NUMBER WAS NOT AS STRONG AS

58:02 PEOPLE THOUGHT.

58:09 LISA CLEANLY QUESTIONING HOW THEY WOULD UP SOME OF THAT

58:12 STRENGTH. I'M CURIOUS ABOUT INTEREST

58:16 RATES 70. SOME PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT HOW

58:22 THAT WOULD REDUCE POOLS IF THEY STAYED HIGH.

58:26 IN SOME CASES, THEY ARE ACCELERATING.

58:30 AT WHAT POINT DOES THAT CHALLENGE VALUATION? ED:

58:36 I HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT THE HISTORY AND VALUATION MULTIPLE.

58:39 THEY SHOULD BE INVERSELY RELATED TO INTEREST RATE AND

58:41 RATION.

58:50 I THINK BUT IT TURNS OUT TO BE IS THAT WHEN INTEREST RATES GO

58:54 UP, IT INCREASES THE CHANCE OF RECESSION.

58:58 THAT IS VALUATION MULTIPLES GET CRUSHED.

59:03 IT IS RISING INTEREST RATES CAUSING RECESSION.

59:06 THAT IS NOT HAPPEN -- HAPPENING THIS TIME.

59:12 CLEARLY, THE FED HAS TIGHT MONETARY POLICY.

59:17 BUT THEY HAVE ALSO NORMALIZED.

59:26 THE ECONOMY CAN HANDLE IT AND THAT IS GREAT FOR EARNINGS.

59:30 IT IS EARLY CYCLE, BUT IT IS MOVING PRETTY QUICK.

59:42 IN THE -- JONATHAN: YOU DATA AGREES WITH YOU.

59:50 I SEE WE GROWTH AND HOURS WERE -- IN HOURS WORKED.

59:55 UNIT LABOR COSTS ARE UNDER CONTROL.

59:58 I YOU MAKING A PRODUCTIVITY CALL? ED:

01:00:04 THAT HAS BEEN MY CALLS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE DECADE.

01:00:08 I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE ROARING 20'S AS A POSSIBLE SCENARIO.

01:00:17 EVEN A REPEAT OF THE 1990'S, BUT I GIVE A PROBABILITY TO

01:00:20 THIS BEING ROARING 20'S WITH A BIG COMEBACK.

01:00:25 IT INCREASED 2.7% YEAR OVER YEAR LAST YEAR.

01:00:33 THE INCREASE IN PRODUCTIVITY IS TO PERCENT. -- 2%.

01:00:42 IT IS HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH THE CPI.

01:00:45 THINGS ARE GOING REALLY WELL FOR THE ECONOMY. JONATHAN:

01:00:49 GOING VERY WELL FOR YOU. WE APPRECIATE THE UPDATE.

01:00:56 6000 YEAR END. LISA:

01:01:02 HE IS ALSO TALKING ABOUT MEGA CAP EIGHT.

01:01:09 IF IT COMES TO PASS, IT WILL ACCOUNT FOR THE OVERALL LEADING

01:01:12 OF THE INDEX.

01:01:19 THAT I THINK IS A CONTROVERSIAL THESIS BUT SOMETHING THAT

01:01:20 PEOPLE ARE CONSIDERING. JONATHAN: IT HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY

01:01:24 PHENOMENAL. LET'S GET YOU AN UPDATE ON

01:01:29 STORIES ELSEWHERE.

01:01:33 >> FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP SAYS HE IS LOOKING AT

01:01:40 IMPOSING A FLAT TARIFF ON CHINESE GOODS, IF ELECTED.

01:01:45 AN INCREASINGLY HAWKISH TONE.

01:01:51 THE U.S. HAS BEEN CHINA'S BIGGEST EXPORT

01:01:54 MARKET FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS.

01:02:02 FIRST QUARTER SALES MISSED EXPECTATIONS AS GROWTH

01:02:03 ACCELERATED.

01:02:09 SAME-STORE SALES ROSE DURING THAT PERIOD, THE LOWEST RATE

01:02:11 SINCE 2020. MCDONALD'S BECAME A TARGET FOR

01:02:20 BOYCOTT AFTER THE WAR BROKE OUT OVER ITS PERCEIVED STANCE ON

01:02:23 THE CONFLICT AND ITS STATUS AS ONE OF THE MOST RECOGNIZED

01:02:24 AMERICAN BRAND.

01:02:30 FANS IN HONG KONG EXPRESS DISAPPOINTMENT AFTER LIONEL

01:02:32 MESSI WAS LEFT ON THE BENCH AFTER A FRIENDLY WIN OVER A, --

01:02:37 OVER A HONG KONG TEAM.

01:02:43 LIONEL MESSI HAS A HAMSTRING STRAIN, SO HE DID NOT PLAY,

01:02:45 LEAVING FANS UPSET. JONATHAN: IF HE IS INJURED, IT IS

01:02:50 UNDERSTANDABLE. BUT CAN YOU IMAGINE PAYING BIG

01:02:54 TIME FOR THOSE TICKET?

01:03:03 DO YOU THINK WE WILL GET THAT FROM THE SUPER BOWL? ANNMARIE:

01:03:08 HONG KONG OFFICIALS.

01:03:14 THE GOVERNMENT ASKED TO SEE HIM. IT WAS NOT JUST THE FANS.

01:03:23 LISA: I THINK IT WILL GENERATE A LOT

01:03:25 OF ECONOMIC.

01:03:34 JONATHAN: POWELL THROWING COLD WATER ON A

01:03:35 MARCH RATE CUT.

01:03:40 >> I THINK IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT THIS COMMITTEE WILL REACH

01:03:42 THAT LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE IN TIME FOR THE MARCH MEETING IN

01:03:44 WEEKS. JONATHAN: THAT IS COMING UP, NEXT.

01:03:50 GOOD MORNING.

01:04:11 JONATHAN: A LITTLE BIT SOFTER ON THE S&P.

01:04:13 YIELDS ARE HIGHER.

01:04:19 THE DOLLAR IS STRONGER. UNDER SURVEILLANCE THIS

01:04:26 MORNING, POWELL THROWING COLD WATER ON A MARCH RATE CUT.

01:04:31 >> I THINK IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT THIS COMMITTEE WILL REACH

01:04:34 THAT LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE IN TIME FOR THE MARCH MEETING IN

01:04:41 SEVEN WEEKS.

01:04:42 THEY BELIEVE IT WILL BE APPROPRIATE FOR US TO CUT THE

01:04:45 FEDERAL FUNDS RATE THIS YEAR. WE WANT TO SEE MORE OF THE DATA

01:04:48 ALONG THOSE LINES. IT JUST NEEDS TO BE GOOD, SO WE

01:04:54 EXPECT TO SEE THAT.

01:05:08 JONATHAN: IS NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU? JOINING US AROUND THE TABLE, A

01:05:16 DIGITAL ADVISOR JOINS US NOW. LET'S GET INTO YOUR PERSONAL

01:05:26 VIEW FIRST.

01:05:32 SALLIE: IT IS INVESTING THROUGH WOMEN.

01:05:41 YES, I AM PERSONALLY BULLISH, BUT I THOUGHT WATCHING JEROME

01:05:45 POWELL ESTIMATE, IT IS HARD NOT

01:05:51 TO WATCH AND SAY I HAVE CONFIDENCE IN HIM.

01:05:57 BUT DO NOT FIGHT THE FED. TOOK ON THE PANDEMIC AND WON.

01:06:05 TIGHTENED LAST YEAR OR TWO YEARS AGO IN THE MARKET WHEN

01:06:07 DOWN. DO NOT FIGHT THE FED.

01:06:17 I AM PERSONALLY FEELING BULLISH. LISA:

01:06:25 IS THERE A SIMILAR BULLISHNESS WITH SOME OF THE ASSET

01:06:26 ALLOCATIONS YOU HAVE CURRENTLY? SALLIE:

01:06:32 WE LOOK AT LONG-TERM RETURNS THAT WE ARE EXPECTING AND THEY

01:06:35 ARE TERRIFIC. THEY TEND TO GO UP ABOUT 10% A

01:06:40 YEAR. IT COMPOUNDS.

01:06:46 IT IS HARD NOT TO BE BULLISH OVER THE LONG TERM.

01:06:51 THEY ARE INVESTING, OFTEN FOR IMPACT.

01:06:57 THE GREAT THING ABOUT THESE WOMEN IS THAT THEY ALSO STAY

01:06:59 THE COURSE.

01:07:01 THEY DO NOT FREAK OUT WHEN MARKETS ARE TOUGH AND THEY

01:07:09 REALLY STAY THE COURSE.

01:07:12 AS A RESULT, WOMEN OUTPERFORMED THEN WHEN THEY INVEST, AND THAT

01:07:14 IS TRUE AT THE PROFESSIONAL LEVEL AND INDIVIDUAL LEVEL.

01:07:20 LISA: BEFORE WE GET TO THE LONG-TERM

01:07:25 VIEW, AS SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN POWERFUL AND A NUMBER OF BANKS,

01:07:28 AND WONDERING HOW CONCERNED YOU ARE ABOUT CREDIT CREATION.

01:07:34 YES, RATES WILL COME DOWN, BUT THERE IS A QUESTION WITH

01:07:37 CERTAIN STRENGTH. HOW MUCH SOME OF THESE FIRMS

01:07:40 CAN KEEP LENDING. DOES THAT KEEP YOU UP AT NIGHT

01:07:43 AT ALL?

01:07:50 SALLIE: WAS IT THE SHOE THAT DROPPED,

01:07:59 THE IMPACT OF RISING INTEREST RATES THAT HAS BEEN FELT?

01:08:05 OR IS THAT THE BEGINNING OF A LONGER-TERM ISSUE?

01:08:08 I FEEL THAT THE JURY IS STILL OUT ON THAT.

01:08:13 BUT EVERY DAY THAT PASSES THAT THIS -- THAT SOMETHING DOES NOT

01:08:16 HAPPEN HAS AN IMPACT. LISA:

01:08:26 WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING WITH RESPECT TO WITHDRAWING SOME OF

01:08:28 THE CAPITAL? SALLIE:

01:08:35 WE INVEST FOR THE LONGER-TERM, SO WE LOOK AT WHAT TO BE VIEW

01:08:42 THE LONGER RETURNS AS BEING AS OPPOSED TO WHAT WILL HAPPEN

01:08:45 THIS DAY, THAT DAY OR NEXT YEAR? ANNMARIE:

01:08:53 WHAT SECTORS ARE YOU MOST EXCITED ABOUT? SALLIE:

01:08:58 ALL OF THEM. WHAT THESE ECONOMIES HAVE SHOWN

01:09:01 IS THAT THEY TEND TOWARDS GROWTH.

01:09:05 WE HAVE A DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO THAT HAS ACCESS TO ALL OF THEM.

01:09:11 WHAT WE ARE SEEING THAT MIGHT BE MORE DIFFERENT IS THAT THEY

01:09:17 TEND TO BE LOOKING FOR IMPACT AND THEY UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE

01:09:23 ALL IMPACT INVESTORS AND EVERY DOLLAR THAT WE INVEST OR SPEND

01:09:28 -- IF WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IF WE ARE GOING INTO A

01:09:32 RECESSION , IT WILL BE THE WOMEN WHO KEEP A CELL, BUT THE

01:09:36 DOLLAR HAS MEANING AND IMPACT. THEY ARE LOOKING TO NOT GIVE UP

01:09:47 A FINANCIAL RETURN AT ALL ANNMARIE:

01:09:51 WHAT DO YOU DEFINE IMPACT AS? SALLIE:

01:09:58 WHETHER IT IS LENDING OR INVESTING -- WHAT IS IT BEING

01:10:02 INVESTED IN? IS IT BEING INVESTIGATED FOR

01:10:04 ENVIRONMENTAL REASONS? WHETHER I WANT TO BE OUT OF

01:10:11 COMPANIES THAT WILL SUFFER FROM GLOBAL WARMING OR I WANT TO BE

01:10:14 IN COMPANIES THAT HAVE A POSITIVE ROLE IN FIGHTING

01:10:15 GLOBAL WARMING. BUT I -- I INVESTING?

01:10:25 LISA: WE ARE HEADED INTO WHAT SOME

01:10:29 PEOPLE WOULD CALL THE POLITICAL SILLY SEASON.

01:10:33 IMPACT INVESTING HAS BEEN HIGHLY POLITICIZED.

01:10:38 HOW IS THAT PLAYING OUT IN TERMS OF WHAT COUNTS AS IMPACT

01:10:41 AND HOW YOU DEFINE SOME OF THESE THINGS.

01:10:47 SALLIE: THERE ARE PEOPLE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE TRYING TO MAKE

01:10:51 CERTAIN INVESTING ILLEGAL. I AM NOT SUPPOSED TO TAKE

01:10:58 GOVERNANCE INTO ACCOUNT WHEN I AM MAKING AN INVESTMENT.

01:11:04 I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO TAKE DIVERSITY OF A LEADERSHIP INTO

01:11:12 ACCOUNT.

01:11:12 THERE ARE VERY FEW THINGS THAT YOU CAN SAY, THIS CORRELATES TO

01:11:17 A GREAT LEADERSHIP TEAM. I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO TAKE THAT

01:11:22 INTO ACCOUNT, SO WE ARE HEADED INTO A FUNKY MOMENT BUT AS

01:11:31 MONEY GOES MORE TOWARDS WOMEN, BECAUSE WOMEN WANT TO INVEST

01:11:35 MORE, IT CAN BE A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT AND CHANGE. LISA:

01:11:42 HAVE YOU HAD A SHIFT IN POLITICAL LINES?

01:11:46 >> WE HEAR IT FROM OTHERS.

01:11:52 BUT FOR US, THE MAJORITY OF OUR CLIENTS ARE WOMEN AND ARE NOT

01:11:55 HEARING BACKLASH. I DO NOT WANT TO GIVE UP THE

01:12:00 FINANCIAL RETURN FOR THE IMPACT. JONATHAN:

01:12:07 STICKING WITH US. IT LOOKS LIKE THIS ON S&P 500.

01:12:14 TREASURY YIELDS ARE HIGHER. 4.08%.

01:12:25 AVP OF THE MESSAGE. TAKING ON EXTRA POWER AFTER THE

01:12:28 PAYROLL STORIES ON FRIDAY. LISA: SOME PEOPLE HAVE USED IT AS A

01:12:35 RESPONSE.

01:12:43 HE WAS -- IT WAS A PRETTY WIDE-RANGING CONVERSATION THAT

01:12:45 HE SAID WAS NOT SUSTAINABLE. HE WAS VERY POLITICAL WITHOUT

01:12:49 BEING POLITICAL. A SENSE OF DISCUSSION.

01:12:55 BUT HE DID NOT DO THAT. JONATHAN: COMING UP A MOMENT.

01:13:04 THE FED'S RATE CUT PATH FROM HERE.

01:13:07 IT FEELS LIKE WE GOT A DOSE OF ICE COLD WATER.

01:13:17 BASED ON WHAT WE HAVE HEARD SO FAR, ALL THREE LOOKING FOR

01:13:20 MARCH RATE CUT PUSHING BACK. LISA QUAN IN 18% OF A MARCH

01:13:29 RATE CUT IN CASE SOMETHING HAPPENS IN TERMS OF NEGATIVE

01:13:30 DATA. IT IS GOING DOWN, AS WE SPEAK.

01:13:39 DONOVAN: ON FRIDAY WE WERE TALKING ABOUT

01:13:42 WHAT IT WOULD TAKE AND I WONDER NOW WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO GET

01:13:45 THE RATE HIKE GOING AGAIN. MORE TO COME FROM NEW YORK CITY

01:13:50 THIS MORNING.

01:14:06 JONATHAN: THE EQUITY MARKET PLAYING BACK

01:14:09 A LITTLE BIT ON THE S&P 500, DOWN A TOUCH AFTER FOUR WEEKS

01:14:13 OF GAINS ON S&P. LISA:

01:14:21 NARROW LEADERSHIP WITH ONE NAME, META-.

01:14:26 AT A CERTAIN POINT, WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE BROADENING OUT, OR

01:14:30 CAN IT BE SUSTAINABLE FOR THE LONGER-TERM?

01:14:39 >> NOT SO GOOD.

01:14:49 LISA: WHEN DOES IT CHANGE? I DO NOT KNOW.

01:14:53 THEY SHOULD CHECK WITH LORI.

01:14:59 JONATHAN: SHE IS ONE OF THE BEST. YIELDS

01:15:03 UP BY SEVEN BASIS POINTS. 10 YEAR NORTH OF 4%.

01:15:13 4.08% ON A 10 YEAR. IF YOU PUSH IT THROUGH A

01:15:18 FOREIGN EXCHANGE, THE DOLLAR IS STRONGER . THE EURO IS 157.87.

01:15:24 LISA: WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IS

01:15:32 ONGOING DIVERGENCE BUT NOW THERE IS A REAL QUESTION OF

01:15:35 CUTTING MEAT. WE WERE DISCOUNTING THAT BEFORE.

01:15:41 JONATHAN: IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE JOBS DATA.

01:15:54 THE STRIKES TARGETING 13 LOCATIONS.

01:16:00 IT WAS THE BIGGEST GARAGE. WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THESE

01:16:05 ATTACKS? ANNMARIE:

01:16:12 THERE ARE MORE OF THEM AND THEY ARE TRYING TO DEGRADE.

01:16:17 IN ONE WAY, HE SAID THERE WILL BE A SUSTAINED RESPONSE, BUT AT

01:16:21 THE SAME TIME, IT WILL NOT BE IN OPEN ENDED CAMPAIGN.

01:16:26 THE WHITE HOUSE IS TRYING TO WALK THE LINE BUT THEY WANT TO

01:16:32 RESPOND BUT DO NOT WANT THE CONFLICT TO SPREAD.

01:16:42 JONATHAN CLIMBED WTI AND RECRUIT THIS MORNING. ANNMARIE:

01:16:48 I WONDER WHERE OIL PRICES WOULD BE. YOU KNOW SOME INVESTORS ARE

01:16:58 PRICING AND RISK, GIVEN HOW IMPORTANT THAT AREA IS.

01:17:03 JONATHAN CLIMBED THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR MORE THAN THREE

01:17:10 MONTHS. LISA:

01:17:11 NOT TO QUOTE YOU, BUT TO QUOTE YOU -- HOW MANY STORIES THAT WE

01:17:16 BEEN READING ABOUT ABOUT HOW OPEC-PLUS IS SUPPLYING MORE OIL

01:17:17 THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT?

01:17:26 IT IS A SUPPLY DRIVEN STORY. I WONDER HOW MUCH IT IS PEOPLE

01:17:29 NOT BETTING ON SOMETHING THAT HAS PLAYED OUT. ANNMARIE:

01:17:35 SAUDI ARABIA IS AT NINE. THE MARKET KNOWS.

01:17:41 THEY ARE NOT LIKE SOME COUNTRIES WHERE IT TAKES A

01:17:42 WHILE TO RAMP UP. THEY CAN DO IT PRETTY QUICKLY.

01:17:53 JONATHAN: UNVEILING AND AID PACKAGE

01:17:55 WITHOUT ANY SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE. THEY NEED TO GET AID TO ISRAEL

01:18:00 QUICKLY.

01:18:07 THE SENATE HOWEVER REACHING A 180 BILLION DOLLARS A PERSON ON

01:18:09 UKRAINE.

01:18:15 ARE THEY EXPECTING TO VOTE ON THEIR BILL NEXT WEEK?

01:18:21 ANNMARIE: I THINK A LOT OF THIS IS NOT GO

01:18:22 THROUGH AS IS. THE FREEDOM CAUCUS COMES OUT

01:18:27 AND SAYS IT IS NOT PAID FOR. MORE ENCOMPASSING, LOOK AT WHAT

01:18:33 THE SENATE IS DOING. A 60% CHANCE FOR THIS BROUGHT

01:18:38 ALSO -- BROADER SUPPLEMENTAL GOING THROUGH.

01:18:44 HE SAYS THAT CURRENT BILL IS DEAD ON ARRIVAL BECAUSE THEY

01:18:45 WANT TO FLEX. BUT AT SOME POINT THIS WILL GO

01:18:52 DOWN TO A CONFERENCE AND THERE IS POTENTIAL.

01:18:56 THE POLITICS MAKE IT MORE COMPLICATED.

01:19:03 JONATHAN: THE COMPANY ANNOUNCING IT FOUND

01:19:07 NORMA'S WEEKS.

01:19:13 THE LATEST IN A STRING OF LAPSES INCLUDING A PANEL

01:19:16 BLOWOUT ON AN ALASKA AIRLINES.

01:19:25 FAA ADMINISTRATOR MICHAEL WHITAKER IS SCHEDULED TO

01:19:26 TESTIFY TOMORROW.

01:19:32 THE MORE INFORMATION YOU GET, THE MORE DISTURBING IT BECOMES.

01:19:37 LISA QUAN WE DO NOT WANT TO HEAR ABOUT HOLES BEING DRILLED.

01:19:42 YOU GET ON THE PLANE AND YOU GO. SHARES ARE DOWN 20%.

01:19:51 IT IS BRUTAL AND IT HAS NOT BEEN GOOD PREVIOUS YEARS.

01:19:55 JONATHAN: PRICING IN FIVE RATE CUT.

01:20:00 THE CAUTIOUS OUTLOOK.

01:20:06 STILL A FIRST RATE CUT. 150 BASIS POINTS OF CUTS FOR

01:20:09 THE YEAR. WE QUESTION THE MAGNITUDE OF

01:20:14 CUTS PRICED IN. GOOD MORNING.

01:20:20 BUT A BLOWOUT REPORT ON FRIDAY. WHAT DID THAT CHANGE FOR YOU,

01:20:22 IF ANYTHING AT ALL?

01:20:27 >> NOT A WHOLE LOT. WHAT I AM LOOKING AT IS THE

01:20:32 INITIAL JOBLESS CLAIMS RISING EVER SO SLIGHTLY.

01:20:36 THE FAR RIGHT ARE A LOT MORE IMPORTANT THAN WHAT HAPPENED

01:20:37 LAST YEAR.

01:20:44 250 JOBS ON AVERAGE LAST YEAR BUT THE QUESTION IS ABOUT WHAT

01:20:47 COMES IN THE DATA THAT IS COMING FORTH.

01:20:54 JONATHAN: HOW CONTROVERSIAL IS THAT THE

01:20:57 CLIENT AT THE MOMENT?

01:21:03 >> YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE DATA IN AGGREGATE THE CLAIMS DATA

01:21:05 TENDS TO BE A LEADING INDICATOR. THE FOCUS WOULD SHIFT FROM

01:21:11 EMPLOYMENT FIGURES TO THE CLAIMS FIGURES, GOING FORWARD.

01:21:19 LISA QUAN HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY ATTENTION TO POWELL LAST NIGHT?

01:21:24 >> HE DID NOT SAY ANYTHING NEW THAT WE DID NOT ALREADY KNOW.

01:21:28 IT LOOKS LIKE HE IS LEANING TOWARDS A JUNE RATE CUT.

01:21:35 BUT THE ECONOMY HAS BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY STRONG.

01:21:40 THERE IS REALLY NO RUSH FOR THE FED TO COME IN AND CUT RATE

01:21:45 SOON BUT THE RISKS, ESPECIALLY LATE IN THE CYCLE ARE ALWAYS

01:21:50 BIASED TOWARDS CUTTING RATES SOONER RATHER THAN LATER.

01:21:59 THE FOCUS WILL BE ON WHAT IS NEXT SHOE THAT WILL DROP?

01:22:05 THEY ARE LOCKED AND LOADED TO CUT RATES, IF NEEDED.

01:22:11 LISA: YOU HAVE ONE PERSON SAYING THAT

01:22:15 YOU ARE EARLY CYCLE AND THE OTHER THING THAT YOU ARE LATE

01:22:21 CYCLE. WHICH IS IT?

01:22:23 >> THERE ARE NO CLEAR SIGNS

01:22:30 THAT A RECESSION IS. WE ARE NOT SEEING THE KINDS OF

01:22:33 CIRCUMSTANCES THAT YOU GENERALLY SEE FOR A RATE CUT,

01:22:37 BUT THINGS COULD CHANGE VERY SOON.

01:22:43 WE COULD POTENTIALLY SEE THE FED COMING IN AND CUTTING

01:22:46 RATES, EVEN TO ORCHESTRATE A SOFT LANDING.

01:22:53 IT IS NOT AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY WILL NOT CUT RATES, IT IS

01:22:55 A QUESTION OF 92. MAYBE THEY DO NOT DELIVER 150

01:23:00 BASIS POINTS OF CUT.

01:23:06 AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY CUT A FEW TIMES BUT NOT REALLY A

01:23:11 FULL-FLEDGED RATE CUT CYCLE IS AN UNDERPRICED RISK.

01:23:15 LISA QUAN THERE IS A QUESTION ABOUT THE LONGER-TERM OUTLOOK.

01:23:20 HOW MUCH I YOU STARTING TO BAKE THAT INTO YOUR EXPECTATIONS FOR

01:23:26 THE LONG-TERM?

01:23:27 >> YIELDS FOR LONGER-TERM ARE

01:23:33 NOT SO MUCH LED BY OUR VIEWS ON INFLATION BUT MOSTLY BY THE

01:23:34 SUPPLY AND DEMAND OUTLOOK. THAT IS WHERE I THINK IT GETS

01:23:40 INTERESTING BECAUSE ONCE WE GET PAST THE MIDDLE OF THE YEAR, IF

01:23:48 THE FED DOES CUT RATES, I THINK THERE IS A POTENTIAL FOR THE

01:23:52 YIELD CURVE TO STEEPEN AND TO START EXPERIENCING A LITTLE BIT

01:23:54 OF PRESSURE.

01:24:00 THERE IS MORE ISSUANCE TO COME DOWN.

01:24:02 THERE IS NOT MUCH WILLINGNESS ON EITHER PARTY TO REDUCE THE

01:24:08 AMOUNT OF DEFICIT REDUCTION OR SPENDING

01:24:11 CUTS, SO IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE, I SEE THAT THE SUPPLY WILL

01:24:15 CONTINUE TO WEIGH ON THE TREASURY YIELD. LISA:

01:24:22 I'M CURIOUS AS TO HOW YOU ARE FACTORING THAT INTO SOME OF

01:24:24 YOUR CALLS. HOW DOES THAT CHANGE THE

01:24:26 BALANCE?

01:24:32 SALLIE: WE BELIEVE IN DIVERSIFICATION,

01:24:37 REGARDLESS OF IF THERE IS INFLATION.

01:24:40 THE EQUITIES DO WELL WHEN YOU HAVE INFLATION.

01:24:45 WE ARE LOOKING OUT TO INVESTING FOR OUR CLIENTS 20 TO 30 YEARS,

01:24:51 GETTING THEN TO WHERE THEY NEED TO BE ON RETIREMENT SO THAT WE

01:24:53 FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT.

01:25:01 LISA QUAN IS IT GOING TO BE INFLATION OR RISK PREMIUM WITH

01:25:04 THE DEFICIT?

01:25:11 SALLIE: INFLATION IS NOT DOWN TO 2%

01:25:15 YET, BUT IT IS ON ITS WAY AND THAT CAN BE A CALL WHERE WE CAN

01:25:20 LOOK AT THIS FROM NEXT YEAR AND SAY THAT IT WAS TRANSITORY,

01:25:22 WASN'T IT? I DO NOT KNOW HOW YOU FEEL, BUT

01:25:27 I FEEL LIKE THE FED HAS BEEN DOING A TERRIFIC JOB NAVIGATING

01:25:29 THROUGH THIS.

01:25:37 >> NOW IT IS TIMES A PULLBACK ON ACCOMMODATION.

01:25:43 JONATHAN QUAN SHOULD THAT BE ON OUR RADAR OR CAN WE DID COUNT

01:25:44 THAT?

01:25:51 >> I THINK WE SHOULD NOT PAY NEARLY AS MUCH ATTENTION, BUT

01:25:54 I'M ALWAYS LOOKING THE NEXT SHOE TO DROP THIS LATE IN THE

01:25:56 CYCLE. IT IS ONE OF THE METRICS THAT

01:26:00 WE LOOK AT.

01:26:07 THE SOONER THE FED MOVES RATES LOWER, THE BETTER FOR BANK

01:26:11 PORTFOLIOS BECAUSE OF UNREALIZED LOSSES.

01:26:17 SALLIE: THEY DID DROP THE BALL FOR A

01:26:20 PERIOD OF TIME.

01:26:26 IT NOW FEELS LIKE IT IS IN THE BACKGROUND, AND THAT WAS SCARY

01:26:29 FOR A SECOND, BUT THEY ADMITTED TO DROPPING THE BALL.

01:26:34 WE CAN TAKE SOME COMFORT THAT THEY ARE ALL OVER THE BANKS BUT

01:26:39 THE THINGS THAT YOU DO NOT LOVE ARE THE WORDS BANK AND THEIR

01:26:40 MARKET.

01:26:47 IT IS NOT WHEN RATES ARE HIGH GETTING FROM THE WEIGHTS TO

01:26:50 HIGHLY THAT HAVE KILLED THEM.

01:27:00 JONATHAN: BRILLIANT. ANNMARIE:

01:27:09 EVERYONE WHO DOES THIS IS A BRILLIANT GUEST. JONATHAN QUAN

01:27:16 THE BRILLIANT -- JONATHAN: THE BRILLIANT SALLIE AND

01:27:21 BRILLIANT SUBADRA.

01:27:25 >> THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED PLANS TO LAY OFF MUCH OF THEIR

01:27:26 WORKFORCE.

01:27:32 SALES AND PROFITS HAVE DECLINED. SOFTENING DEMAND OUT OF ASIA.

01:27:40 THEY CUT IT APPROACH FOR THE YEAR AHEAD.

01:27:43 SHARES FOR CATERPILLAR ON THE

01:27:49 RISE AFTER REPORTING THAT HELPED THE COMPANY POST PROFIT

01:27:51 AND SOME OF THE ESTIMATE.

01:28:01 CHIPOTLE IS GETTING READY FOR ITS SO-CALLED BURRITO SEASON.

01:28:10 THEY WILL HIRE 19,000 NEW WORKERS IN ANTICIPATION OF A

01:28:15 RISE IN BURRITO SALES. JONATHAN: UP NEXT ON THE PROGRAM,

01:28:22 REGIONAL BANKS IN THE SPOTLIGHT. >> I THINK THERE ARE SMALLER

01:28:30 REGIONAL BANKS THAT ARE UNDER RESERVED, SO THIS IS NOT THE

01:28:33 FIRST PIECE OF BAD NEWS THAT WE COULD GET ON THE REGIONAL

01:28:34 BANKING SECTOR. JONATHAN QUAN YOU ARE WATCHING

01:28:38 BLOOMBERG TV.

01:29:01 JONATHAN: EQUITIES ARE NEGATIVE. YIELDS HIGHER BY EIGHT BASIS

01:29:04 POINTS.

01:29:05 UNDER SURVEILLANCE THIS MORNING, REGIONAL BANKS ARE

01:29:12 BACK IN THE SPOTLIGHT.

01:29:16 WEBSITE THINK THAT THERE ARE SMALLER REGIONAL BANKS THAT ARE

01:29:18 UNDER RESERVED. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST PIECE OF

01:29:22 BAD NEWS. I THINK YOU HAVE TO BE COGNIZANT OF THOSE RISKS.

01:29:35 IT IS JUST A QUESTION OF THE BROADER SPILLOVERS IN THE

01:29:37 ECONOMY THAT WE THINK WILL BE MANAGEABLE.

01:29:43 JONATHAN: REPORTING A LOSS.

01:29:49 ALEXANDER YOCUM WRITING THIS. IT WAS RELATIVELY UNIQUE, BUT

01:29:56 WE EXPECT A REGIONAL GROUP TO FEEL THE FALLOUT OF THE TOUGH

01:30:00 QUARTER.

01:30:06 ALEXANDER JOINS US FOR MORE. LET'S BUILD FROM THERE.

01:30:16 WHAT KIND OF ISSUES HAS THIS BANK FACED?

01:30:22 >> I WANT TO SET THE STAGE FIRST. IT WAS DEFINITELY THE

01:30:26 DEPOSIT STORY. ARE THEY LEAVING THE BANK?

01:30:34 WE THINK THAT THIS YEAR WILL BE THE YEAR OF CREDIT QUALITY.

01:30:48 THE TOP 10 IT IS MUCH LESS THAN THAT.

01:30:54 THEY ARE ALSO FAR LESS RESERVED. BY LESS THAN THE TYPICAL BANK.

01:31:03 I'M SURE THEY WOULD HAVE ARGUED THAT THIS WAS BECAUSE THE

01:31:06 CREDIT QUALITY WAS BETTER BUT THAT WE SAW THE CREDIT QUALITY

01:31:08 GETTING WORSE.

01:31:15 IN TERMS OF CAPITAL LEVELS, THEY AT LEAST FOR THE LOWEST

01:31:18 CAPITAL IN THE PORTFOLIO.

01:31:24 THE CREDIT QUALITY GOT WORSE. JONATHAN:

01:31:32 WE SPOKE TO A COUPLE CEOS, OUR BOOK IS OK BUT DO NOT KNOW

01:31:34 ABOUT ANYBODY ELSE.

01:31:41 ARE SOME REGIONS THAN OTHERS?

01:31:49 >> THEY ONLY HAD TWO LOANS GO BAD.

01:31:53 ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU CAN START FREAKING OUT THAT MAYBE IT WAS

01:31:55 JUST A ONE-OFF, BUT IT WAS NOT.

01:32:01 THERE WILL PROBABLY BE PRESSURE TO RAISE RESERVES, JUST IN CASE

01:32:02 SOMETHING HAPPENS.

01:32:08 WE BASICALLY HAD NO CHARGE-OFFS. THAT IS THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC.

01:32:12 EVERYTHING WAS FINE AND THEN ONE QUARTER WAS BAD.

01:32:21 EVEN BANKS THAT ARE IN BETTER MARKETS, EVEN THOSE THAT WE

01:32:24 FEEL MIGHT PAY SOME PRESSURE.

01:32:31 LISA CLIMBED JAY POWELL CAME OUT AND SAID THERE ARE BANKS

01:32:37 THAT HAVE CONCENTRATED EXPOSURES THAT ARE CHALLENGED.

01:32:41 WE ARE WORKING WITH THEM. WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

01:32:45 EXPECTED LOSSES. HOW DO YOU THINK THEY ARE

01:32:51 WORKING WITH THESE BANKS RIGHT NOW?

01:33:01 EVEN MULTI FAMILY DOUBLED THEIR RESERVES AND A QUARTER.

01:33:06 IF YOU ARE DOUBLING THE RESERVES, YOU ARE EITHER

01:33:07 PRESSURED TO DO THAT OR YOU FEEL LIKE THEY COULD BE

01:33:11 POTENTIAL LOSSES DOWN THE ROAD.

01:33:17 LISA: IS THIS REALLY GOING TO BE 50?

01:33:27 >> WE ANALYZE THE TOP 30 BIG.

01:33:37 IT IS GENERALLY BETTER CAPITALIZE AND BETTER RESERVED

01:33:40 AND GENERALLY HAS MORE EXPOSURE. WE EXPECTED TO BE BELOW 100

01:33:45 MILLION IN ASPECTS.

01:33:51 THEY HAD THE BANKS THAT ARE

01:33:59 CLOSEST. HOW WOULD THEY FAIR? THEY HAVE ISSUES.

01:34:03 THEY WERE GOING TO GET ACQUIRED. THEY COULD FACE INCREASED

01:34:10 SCRUTINY.

01:34:18 LISA: THERE IS QUESTIONS ABOUT A SYSTEMIC RISK OR THE LOCAL

01:34:22 ECONOMY. AND THEN THERE IS THE ISSUE OF

01:34:25 VALUATION. DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE

01:34:29 ACCOUNTED FOR THE WEAKNESS THAT YOU SEE?

01:34:37 >> GENERALLY SPEAKING, THEY ARE DEPRESSED.

01:34:45 THEY WILL PROBABLY BE A GOOD BUY.

01:34:51 THE BANKS THAT SEE UNEXPECTED LOSSES, THERE WILL BE ISSUES

01:34:52 THERE. BUT OTHERS HAVE HIGH CAPITAL

01:34:56 LEVELS. THERE IS A DICHOTOMY THERE.

01:35:08 -- JONATHAN: DOES THIS HINDER THEIR ABILITY?

01:35:11 IS THAT HAPPENING?

01:35:16 >> UNFORTUNATELY, IT IS. THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT CUTTING

01:35:20 LOAN EXPOSURE. THAT INCLUDES MY CV.

01:35:29 WE WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF THEY WENT NEGATIVE IN TERMS OF

01:35:30 GROWTH RATE. IT DOES HINDER THAT.

01:35:38 IF YOU ARE ASKED TO INCREASE CAPITAL, IT IS A DIFFICULT TIME

01:35:39 TO BE INCREASING. JONATHAN: CAN THEY BE SELF-FULFILLING?

01:35:47 THE ECONOMY STARTS TO ROLL OVER AND HURT VALUATIONS.

01:35:54 PEOPLE ACQUIRE NEW PROPERTY AND THEN YOU START TO GET PRICES

01:35:55 HIT AGAIN.

01:36:03 >> IT CAN BE WITH A DIFFERENT TYPE OF COMPANY.

01:36:05 IF THE PRICE FALLS, THAT IS USUALLY A GOOD BUYING

01:36:07 OPPORTUNITY. WITH THE BANKS, IT IS ALL ABOUT

01:36:11 THE TRUSTS.

01:36:18 I WOULD AGREE. JONATHAN: THANK YOU.

01:36:26 LISA, GO.

01:36:35 LISA: IT IS SHOCKING THAT PEOPLE ARE

01:36:37 NOT WORKING ON IT. I THINK THAT IS AN OPEN

01:36:42 QUESTION. IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE FINANCING, MAYBE IT EXPLAINS.

01:36:52 ANNMARIE: 1.2 TRILLION IS TIED UP.

01:36:55 JONATHAN: AND IF THEY SAY IT IS NOT OUR

01:37:01 PROBLEM, IT IS THERE'S -- YOU HEAR THAT ON REPEAT. LISA:

01:37:06 JAY POWELL REALLY ADDRESS THIS. THEY ARE WORKING WITH THEM.

01:37:12 HOW ARE THEY WORKING WITH THEM? ARE THEY OVERSEEING?

01:37:18 HOW DO YOU ADJUST? JONATHAN:

01:37:24 MANY WOULD SAY IT WAS NOT OVERSIGHT.

01:37:31 ANNMARIE: THEY ARE COMING IN AND SAYING,

01:37:33 BE ASKED THEM TO GET WATER DOWN. JONATHAN:

01:37:35 THE REGIONAL BANKS PULLING BACK ON LENDING AND TIGHTENING

01:37:39 STANDARDS. THE FED HAS TO STAY ON HOLD FOR

01:37:43 LONGER. ASKING A QUESTION AFTER THE

01:37:48 REPORT CAME OUT. THE MORE IT BECOMES DELAYED,

01:37:54 THE HARDER IT BECOMES TO LAND SAFELY.

01:37:58 NO RECESSION IN THE NEXT YEAR. LISA:

01:38:03 THAT IS STILL THE UNDERLYING QUESTION.

01:38:11 SHADOW BANKERS CAN COME TO THE EQUATION AND THINK ABOUT SOME

01:38:13 OF THE AUTO LOANS AND OTHERS. IT WILL NOT BE A COMPLETE

01:38:20 REMOVAL OF CREDIT ALTOGETHER.

01:38:28 JONATHAN: ALL OF THAT IN A WHOLE LOT MORE

01:38:31 INCOME AND THE EQUITY MARKET PULLING BACK JUST A TOUCH.

01:38:37 YIELDS ARE A LOT HIGHER ON THE 10 YEAR. FROM NEW YORK CITY THIS

01:38:41 MORNING, GOOD MORNING.

01:39:02 >> THIS IS A VERY STRONG REPORT, STRONG LABOR MARKET.

01:39:07 THE FED DOESN'T HAVE TO NORMALIZE POLICY AS QUICK.

01:39:11 >> THERE IS NO DATA THERE THAT SAYS WE ARE HEADING TO A CLIFF,

01:39:14 WE WILL HAVE A SUDDEN SHIFT IN GROWTH.

01:39:18 >> VERY GRADUAL SIGNS OF SOFTENING.

01:39:21 >> THIS MEANS MARCHES OFF THE TABLE.

01:39:24 THIS ALSO MEANS WE ARE MORE LIKELY TO GET THE THREE CUTS

01:39:26 THAT THE FED HAS SIGNALED.

01:39:31 >> WHETHER IT IS MARCH OR MAY OR JUNE IT IS IN THAT TIMEFRAME

01:39:33 THAT WE EXPECT THAT FIRST CUT.

01:39:41 >> THIS IS "BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE"

01:39:43 WITH JONATHAN FERRO, LISA, AND ANNMARIE HORDERN. JONATHAN:

01:39:50 YOUR EQUITY MARKET ON THE S&P, NEGATIVE BY 0.1%.

01:39:53 90 MINUTES AWAY FROM THE OPENING BELL.

01:39:57 THE QUIET PERIOD IS OVER FOR THE FEDERAL RESERVE, FED SPEAK

01:39:59 IS ALREADY STARTED. NEEL KASHKARI IN AN ONLINE

01:40:04 ESSAY, POLICY IS NOT TOO TIGHT. BASED ON PAYROLLS ON FRIDAY,

01:40:08 POLICY IS NOT TOO TIGHT. LISA: BASICALLY SAYING THE NEUTRAL

01:40:14 RATE MAY HAVE INCREASED, ONE OF THE KEY QUESTIONS OF WHETHER WE

01:40:16 ARE RUNNING AT A NEW NORMAL THAT IS HOTTER, ONE WHERE WE

01:40:22 HAVE ENOUGH MOMENTUM TO KEEP GROWING AT THIS PACE EVEN WITH

01:40:23 5% RATES.

01:40:29 IT'S POSSIBLE THE POLICY STANCE SIGNALS THAT THE RATE HAS

01:40:32 INCREASED. IT WILL STILL BE A MATTER OF

01:40:35 INCREASING THE DATA TO GET THE RIGHT MIX OF ONE TO CUT RATES.

01:40:37 JONATHAN: AT THE MOMENT, THE FEDERAL

01:40:41 RESERVE HAS THIS RISK FRIENDLY START.

01:40:43 IF THE ECONOMY IS DOING WELL, WE DON'T HAVE TO HIKE MORE.

01:40:47 IF IT STARTS TO UNDERPERFORM, WE CAN CUT.

01:40:52 JUST HOW FAR BACK TO BE PUSHBACK THAT FIRST CUT? LISA:

01:40:55 I WOULD GUESS PRETTY FAR. IF YOU TAKE JAY POWELL AT HIS

01:41:00 WORD, HE IS CONCERNED ABOUT INFLATION RUNNING HOTTER THAN

01:41:03 THEY PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT. A LOT OF PEOPLE LOOKING AT THE

01:41:07 FORWARD-LOOKING CLAIMS, THINGS OF THAT NATURE, WHICH SHOW A

01:41:10 DIFFERENT PICTURE. JONATHAN: THEN YOU GET CLOSER TO THE

01:41:13 ELECTION. TALKING ABOUT 50 BASIS POINTS

01:41:17 OF CUTS FROM THE FED. NOT AT THE NEXT MEETING, THE

01:41:21 ONE AFTER THAT, BUT THE WHOLE YEAR.

01:41:23 HE TALKED ABOUT THE ELECTION BEING A KEY DATE ON THIS

01:41:28 CALENDAR. IF YOU GET A CHANGE FROM

01:41:31 PRESIDENT BIDEN TO PRESIDENT TRUMP, AND PRESIDENT TRUMP GOES

01:41:37 IN TALKING ABOUT 60% TARIFFS ON CHINA, WHETHER YOU HAVE TO

01:41:39 RECALIBRATE YOUR OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION. ANNMARIE:

01:41:44 YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO RECALIBRATE NOT ONLY THE 60%

01:41:47 BLANKET TARIFF ON CHINA GOODS IT ALSO THIS TARIFF WALL THAT

01:41:50 THIS ADMINISTRATION IS POTENTIALLY TALKING ABOUT OF

01:41:53 ALL IMPORTED GOODS. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR

01:41:56 CONSUMER PRICES? THEY WILL SKYROCKET. JONATHAN:

01:41:58 YOU CANNOT SEPARATE THIS CONVERSATION FROM THE CHINESE

01:42:02 MARKET. YOU ARE SEEING WILD SWINGS IN

01:42:05 CHINESE EQUITIES. NO DOUBT THAT IS A BIG ISSUE

01:42:09 FOR ANYONE INVESTING THEIR. LISA:

01:42:12 IT IS NOT BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE GAMING OUT WHAT 6% TARIFFS

01:42:14 WOULD DO. HOW DO YOU HAVE ANY CONVICTION

01:42:19 OF BUSINESS PLANS IN CHINA? HOW DO YOU HAVE ANY KIND OF

01:42:23 INVESTMENT PLAN IN CHINESE EQUITIES?

01:42:29 WE HEAR AGAIN AND AGAIN, GUEST AFTER GUEST, IS THIS WHAT GETS

01:42:32 PUT IN PLACE OR JUST THE SUGGESTION OF VOLATILITY AND

01:42:37 POLICY? ANNMARIE:

01:42:38 LEVERAGE OF BECOMING A PRESIDENT POTENTIALLY.

01:42:42 BUT GOLDMAN SACHS IS SAYING THAT WHAT TRUMP IS TALKING

01:42:44 ABOUT IS STARTING TO ON THEIR CLIENTS.

01:42:47 THEY ARE PUTTING OUT NOTES SAYING THEY ARE NERVOUS ABOUT

01:42:52 WHAT THIS MEANS. JONATHAN:

01:42:54 CHINESE EQUITIES, MULTIYEAR LOWS, HE WAS, ALL-TIME HIGHS.

01:42:59 DOWN 0.1% ON THE S&P. YIELDS HIGHER BY NINE BASIS

01:43:02 POINTS. 41136 ON THE 10-YEAR.

01:43:10 LISA: JAY POWELL TAKING MARCH KIND OF

01:43:11 OFF THE TABLE. EVEN BEFORE GETTING THE DATA ON

01:43:13 FRIDAY. THAT IS TELLING ON WHERE THE

01:43:16 BIAS IS. JONATHAN: COMING UP THIS HOUR, HERE IS

01:43:21 THE LINEUP. SAVITA SUBRAMANIAN BANK OF

01:43:25 AMERICA WEIGHING IN. HENRIETTA TREYZ ON VEDA

01:43:30 PARTNERS ON THE BIDEN-TRUMP REMATCH.

01:43:34 AND FRANCES DONALD ON THE FED'S COLD FEET RATE CUT.

01:43:41 SAVITA SUBRAMANIAN, HEAD OF U.S. EQUITY STRATEGY AT BOFA SAYING

01:43:42 THIS. THE IDIOSYNCRATIC VERSUS MACRO

01:43:46 RISK IS HIGH. THIS REDUCTIVE MONIKER OBSCURES

01:43:51 THE COMPANIES ARE BEHAVING VERY DIFFERENTLY FROM ONE ANOTHER.

01:43:54 EUPHORIA IS EVIDENT FOR THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN BUT NOTHING

01:43:58 ELSE. SAVINO JOINS US AT THE TABLE.

01:44:01 THANKS FOR BEING WITH US. HOW DIFFERENT IS THE

01:44:05 PERFORMANCE NOW IN THE SEVEN STOCKS? SAVITA:

01:44:10 IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH WE THINK ABOUT THE

01:44:14 MARKET BEING ONE DIRECTION, SEVEN COMPANY LEADING THE

01:44:16 CHARGE, THE STOCKS THEMSELVES ARE ASKING DIFFERENTLY.

01:44:21 IF YOU MEASURE IDIOSYNCRATIC RISK AS A NONSPECIFIC RISK, WE

01:44:23 HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN STOCK SPECIFIC RISK.

01:44:27 WHAT THIS MEANS IN ENGLISH IS THAT YOU CAN MAKE MORE MONEY

01:44:29 PICKING STOCKS THAN JUST BUYING THE INDEX OUTRIGHT.

01:44:33 THAT HAS BEEN OUR CALL FOR A WHILE.

01:44:36 WHAT HAS BEEN UNNERVING ABOUT THE LAST FEW MONTHS, WE HAVE

01:44:40 NOT NECESSARILY SEEN A BROADENING PATTERN EMERGE IN

01:44:44 THE MARKET, STILL SEEING LEADERSHIP DECISIVELY IN THIS

01:44:45 COHORT. LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED AFTER

01:44:48 EARNINGS FOR THESE COMPANIES. THESE STOCKS ARE PRICED FOR

01:44:51 PERFECTION. EVERYBODY OWNS THEM, THEY ARE

01:44:55 PRETTY EXPENSIVE. MAYBE NOT AS EXPENSIVE AS PRIOR

01:45:03 TECH BUBBLE LEVELS BUT THEY ARE RELATIVELY HEALTHY IN TERMS OF

01:45:04 THE EVALUATIONS. WHAT HAPPENS FROM HERE IS A

01:45:07 BROADENING TO OTHER AREAS OF THE MARKET THAT ARE NOT AS

01:45:11 NECESSARILY RISKY AS WE THINK. JONATHAN:

01:45:13 WE THINK PRICE TO PERFECTION AND THEN RUNNING ANOTHER 20% IN

01:45:18 A DAY. JUST WONDERING WHAT TO TAKE

01:45:21 AWAY FROM FRIDAYS PRICE ACTION. SAVITA: INITIATING A DIVIDEND.

01:45:28 A BIG GROWTH COMPANY INITIATING A DIVIDEND.

01:45:31 THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT SIGNAL.

01:45:35 OUR CALL IS THAT WE ARE AT A POINT WHERE THE NEXT LEG HIGHER

01:45:39 IN EQUITIES IS LIKELY TO BE RETIREES MAYBE MOVING OUT OF

01:45:42 CASH, BACK INTO RISKIER SOURCE OF YIELD.

01:45:46 OF COURSE, THIS WAS PREDICATED ON THE IDEA THAT THE FED WOULD

01:45:50 START CUTTING INTEREST RATES, WHICH IS A BIGGER QUESTION

01:45:54 TODAY WHEN THAT HAPPENS. HOW MUCH, HOW SOON.

01:45:59 BUT THE IDEA OF THIS WALL OF CASH SITTING THERE IN MONEY

01:46:03 MARKET, SHORT DURATION BONDS EARNING 5%, IF THAT START TO

01:46:05 COME DOWN OR YOU SEE EQUITY YIELDS COME UP, AS WE ARE IN

01:46:10 CERTAIN PARTS OF THE MARKET, THAT COULD BE THE VALUE

01:46:11 PROPOSITION FOR EQUITIES. IT IS LIKE TINA 2.0.

01:46:17 LISA: THAT HAPPENS WHEN RATES START

01:46:19 GETTING CUT AND THE ECONOMY STARTS CHUGGING ALONG.

01:46:25 HOW MUCH DOES IT SHIFT YOUR THESIS IF THE RATE CUTS DON'T

01:46:28 HAPPEN AS SOON OR AS DEEPLY AS THE MARKETS ARE CURRENTLY

01:46:29 EXPECTING? SAVITA: I THINK THIS IS A SLOW

01:46:32 EVOLUTION. I GUESS YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT

01:46:35 FOR THE FED TO ACTUALLY CUT INTEREST RATES TO THINK ABOUT

01:46:38 EQUITY YIELD. THINK ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING

01:46:41 RIGHT NOW. THE REASON THE FED MIGHT NOT

01:46:45 CUT IS BECAUSE OF AN INFLATION SURPRISE.

01:46:49 HOW DO YOU WANT TO PROTECT AGAINST INFLATION?

01:46:53 EQUITY INCOME IS THE BEST WAY TO PROTECT A RETIREE'S ASSETS

01:46:57 FROM INFLATION AS WELL AS OFFERING INCOME.

01:47:01 THAT BECOMES THE NAME OF THE GAME AGAIN.

01:47:04 IF YOU THINK ABOUT A COUPLE YEARS AGO WHERE WE HAD RAMPANT

01:47:10 INFLATION, THE FED WAS HIKING RATES, EQUITY INCOME DID WELL.

01:47:14 HI DIVIDEND YIELDING STOCKS WAS ONE OF THE BEST PLACES TO BE IN

01:47:16 THE 2023 MARKET. OR THE 2022 BEAR MARKET.

01:47:22 LISA: WHY ISN'T IT WORKING?

01:47:28 I AM LOOKING AT THE MAGNIFICENT 7, 8, AND YOU ARE RIGHT, IT IS

01:47:29 DIVERSIFICATION. BASICALLY JUST META AND NVIDIA

01:47:33 THIS YEAR.

01:47:34 HOW MUCH DO YOU QUESTION THE THESIS IF IT IS NOT BORNE OUT

01:47:41 NOW? SAVITA: TYPICALLY IF YOU THINK ABOUT A

01:47:46 BIG GROWTH COMPANY INITIATING A DIVIDEND, A TECH COMPANY

01:47:49 INITIATING A DIVIDEND, THAT WOULD BE ANATHEMA.

01:47:51 BUT INVESTORS WANT TO SEE THAT. THEY WANT TO SEE COMPANIES WITH

01:47:56 DISCIPLINE, RETURNING CASH. THEY WANT TO SEE THEM GIVE BACK

01:47:59 A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY. JONATHAN: YOU WERE OVERWEIGHT FINANCIALS,

01:48:03 STILL OVERWEIGHT THE BANKS. WHAT DO YOU LIKE ABOUT THAT

01:48:05 SECTOR? SAVITA: THERE IS STILL THIS

01:48:10 UNDERAPPRECIATED ASPECT WITH ART CAP NEXT THAT HAS YET TO BE

01:48:14 RECOGNIZED BY THE MARKET. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE UNDERLYING

01:48:21 EARNINGS TRENDS OF LARGE REGULATED COMPANIES, THEY ARE

01:48:22 ACTUALLY RELATIVELY HEALTHY. THESE ARE WELL-CAPITALIZED

01:48:29 COMPANIES, DIVIDEND PRESERVATION IS NOT AT RISK

01:48:30 LIKE SOME OF THESE REGIONALS. THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT IS

01:48:35 LIKELY TO FLATLINE FROM HERE, NOT GET ANY WORSE, AT LEAST FOR

01:48:37 THE BIG GUYS. THAT'S A POSITIVE. IF YOU THINK ABOUT INFLATION

01:48:45 PROTECTED YIELD, I THINK ABOUT FINANCIALS. JONATHAN:

01:48:48 THE EMPHASIS WAS ON THE BIG GUYS. WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE

01:48:50 SMALLER GUYS? SAVITA:

01:48:56 I THINK IT IS TOO SOON, IF WE ARE NOT IN THE ALL CLEAR, I

01:49:01 THINK YOU WANT TO STICK WITH LARGER, WELL-CAPITALIZED

01:49:03 FINANCIAL COMPANIES. I PERSONALLY WORRY A LITTLE BIT

01:49:05 ABOUT SMALL CAPS. WE ARE BULLISH ON SMALL CAPS

01:49:12 WITH A VERY BIG CAVEAT THAT THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF

01:49:16 SMALLER COMPANIES THAT ARE, LIKE BANKS, REAL ESTATE, A LOT

01:49:20 MORE RISK AROUND THE FACT THAT THE FED MOVED FROM ZERO TO FIVE.

01:49:25 A LOT OF THAT ATTRITION AND PAIN IS SMALLER IN THE SMALLER

01:49:27 BENCHMARK RATHER THAN THE LARGER BENCHMARK. LISA: ENERGY.

01:49:33 IS IT STILL A HEDGE AGAINST INFLATION OR DOES IT HOLD A

01:49:35 HOST OF OTHER RISKS? SAVITA: IT IS AN INTERESTING SECTOR.

01:49:43 FROM NERVOUS PERSPECTIVE, MY SENSE IS A LOT OF THOSE RISKS

01:49:44 ARE PRICED IN AT THIS POINT. THESE COMPANIES ARE NO LONGER

01:49:55 JUST EXTRACTING OIL FROM THE GROUND AT THE LEAST PROVOCATION

01:49:56 OF PRICE HIKES IN CONNECTION. SUPPLY WILL BE CONSTRAINED,

01:50:01 WHICH MEANS EARNINGS WILL BE LESS VOLATILE.

01:50:04 I THINK THIS IS A SECTOR THAT PLAYS A ROLE IN GETTING TO THAT

01:50:06 ZERO IF WE EVER DO. IT IS ALSO A SOURCE I REALLY

01:50:11 HEALTHY YIELD. AND THE COMPANIES HAVE TOLD US

01:50:16 THEY ARE LASER FOCUSED ON PRESERVING CASH RETURN RATHER

01:50:19 THAN PRODUCTION TARGETS. I THINK THAT IS THE BIG

01:50:23 SEACHANGE IN THE ENERGY SECTOR. THESE COMPANIES NOW HAVE

01:50:26 DISCIPLINE. VERY DIFFERENT PRIOR TO 2017.

01:50:31 JONATHAN: 72 ON WTI. SO VITO WILL BE STICKING WITH

01:50:35 US I'M PLEASED TO SAY. LET'S TALK ABOUT U.S.

01:50:39 POLICY IN THE MIX. HE IS YOUR BLOOMBERG GREEN WITH

01:50:42 UEHARA? HAS. YAHAIRA:

01:50:48 CHINA TRYING TO FIGHT A DEEPENING STOP TRADING PLUNGE.

01:50:55 THE COUNTRY IS TRYING TO STABILIZE MARKETS AFTER SHARES

01:50:59 SENT TO A FIVE-YEAR LOW IN TRADING ON FRIDAY, WITH THE CSI

01:51:03 300 DOWN FOR PERCENT SINCE THE START OF LAST WEEK.

01:51:08 BOEING LOWER IN PREMARKET TRADING AFTER THE AIRCRAFT

01:51:10 MAKER SAYS IT FOUND MORE ISSUES WITH HOLES DRILLED IN THE

01:51:13 FUSELAGE OF ITS 737 MAX JETS. THE LATEST PROBLEM ORIGINATED

01:51:16 WITH A SUPPLIER. IT WILL REQUIRE REPAIRS ON

01:51:21 ABOUT 50 JETS AND MAY DELAY PLANE DELIVERIES IN THE

01:51:22 NEAR-TERM. THE DEFECT FOLLOWS A STRING OF

01:51:28 MANUFACTURING PROBLEMS AT BOEING, PROMPTING THE FAA TO

01:51:29 STEP UP SCRUTINY OF THE COMPANY. MCDONALD'S FOURTH-QUARTER SALES

01:51:36 MISSED ESTIMATES AS GROWTH SLOWED, OR IN PART BY THE WAR

01:51:39 IN THE MIDDLE EAST. SAME-STORE SALES ROSE 3% IN THE PERIOD,

01:51:43 MARKING THE SLOWEST RATE SINCE 2020.

01:51:47 MCDONALD BECAME A TARGET FOR BOYCOTTS AFTER THE WAR BETWEEN

01:51:50 ISRAEL AND HAMAS BROKE OUT AFTER HIS PERCEIVED STANCE ON

01:51:53 THE CONFLICT AS WELL AS ITS STATUS AS ONE OF THE MOST

01:51:55 RECOGNIZED AMERICAN BRANDS. JONATHAN: 215 BILLION U.S.

01:52:01 DOLLARS, MARKET CAP AS OF FRIDAY.

01:52:06 THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT, THE MORE NUTS IT IS. LISA:

01:52:12 $50 BILLION SET ASIDE FOR ADDITIONAL DIVIDENDS IN ONE DAY.

01:52:15 JONATHAN: IMPORTANT STUFF. EQUITY FUTURES MORE BROADLY

01:52:20 DOWN 0.1% ON THE S&P. UP NEXT, PRESIDENT BIDEN EATING

01:52:24 THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.

01:52:28 >> THIS IS NOT JUST A CAMPAIGN, THIS IS MORE OF A MISSION.

01:52:32 WE CANNOT, CANNOT LOSE THIS CAMPAIGN FOR THE GOOD OF THE

01:52:33 COUNTRY. I MEAN THAT FROM THE BOTTOM OF

01:52:35 MY HEART. JONATHAN: THAT IS COMING UP NEXT ON THE

01:52:38 PROGRAM. LIVE FROM NEW YORK, THIS IS

01:52:40 BLOOMBERG. ♪.

01:52:58 JONATHAN: A LITTLE MORE THAN ONE HOUR

01:53:00 AWAY FROM THE OPENING BILL, MONDAY MORNING.

01:53:05 EQUITY FUTURES ON THE S&P 500 NEGATIVE BY 0.1%.

01:53:08 DO I SEEM OVER IT ALREADY? IS THAT WHY WE ARE LAUGHING?

01:53:14 LISA: IT IS MONDAY AGAIN. HERE WE ARE. JONATHAN:

01:53:18 PRESIDENT BIDEN HITTING THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. PRES. BIDEN:

01:53:24 THE KIND THAT WE ARE RUNNING AGAINST, HE IS NOT FOR

01:53:25 ANYTHING, HE IS AGAINST EVERYTHING.

01:53:28 IT IS EVEN WORSE IN TERMS OF HIS BEHAVIOR THAN THE LAST TIME

01:53:30 IN 2020. THIS IS NOT JUST A CAMPAIGN,

01:53:34 THIS IS MORE OF A MISSION. WE CANNOT, CANNOT, CANNOT LOSE

01:53:38 THE CAMPAIGN FOR THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY.

01:53:42 AND I MEAN THAT FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART. JONATHAN:

01:53:46 BIDEN FEELS THE SAME WAY, HERE WE GO AGAIN.

01:53:52 A RECENT POLL SHOWING DONALD TRUMP TRAILING.

01:53:55 HENRIETTA TREYZ SAYS THAT PRESIDENT CAN MAKE A COMEBACK.

01:54:02 BIDEN'S LOW STANDING WILL RISE AS DEMOCRATS AND INDEPENDENT

01:54:03 LEANING DEMOCRATS WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HE WILL BE THE

01:54:04 NOMINEE. VOTER SENTIMENT WILL IMPROVE

01:54:08 WHICH WILL PROVIDE A DOUBLE BENEFIT OR BIDEN AS THE

01:54:10 INCUMBENT PRESIDENT. HENRIETTA JOINS US NOW FOR MORE.

01:54:18 FANTASTIC TO CATCH UP WITH YOU AS ALWAYS.

01:54:21 YOU HAVE BIDEN WINNING THE WHITE HOUSE, GOP WINNING THE

01:54:22 SENATE. THE SWING STATE POLLING THAT WE

01:54:29 DID AT BLOOMBERG LAST WEEK, AND THE PRESENCE BEHIND TRUMP IN

01:54:30 ALL SEVEN KEY SWING STATES. CAN YOU GO THROUGH MORE DETAIL

01:54:35 WHAT TURNED THAT AROUND AS BE GO DEEPER INTO 24? HENRIETTA:

01:54:39 THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME. THE FIRST THING I POINT OUT TO

01:54:43 INVESTORS, AS WE TALKED A COUPLE WEEKS BACK, YOU WANT TO

01:54:49 SKATE TO WHERE THE PUCK IS GOING WITH POLLING DATA.

01:54:54 THAT DATA WAS PHENOMENALLY INFORMATIVE AND THAT YOU ARE

01:54:56 SEEING VOTERS, OFF THE BENCH AND PICK A CANDIDATE.

01:54:59 WHAT WE HAVE NOTICED BETWEEN REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS,

01:55:04 THERE ARE FAR MORE UNDECIDED INDEPENDENCE AND DEMOCRATS THAN

01:55:05 REPUBLICANS. AND SOME OF THE POLLS, 8% OF

01:55:10 THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY UNDECIDED. IN DECEMBER, 30% WERE STILL

01:55:15 UNCLEAR ABOUT WHICH CANDIDATE THEY WILL PICK.

01:55:19 IN AMERICA CAN WE DON'T CHANGE OUR OPINION THAT OFTEN, WE JUST

01:55:23 DON'T COME HOME TO OUR PARTY NOMINEE UNTIL WE HAVE TO,

01:55:25 PARTICULARLY THIS YEAR. IT IS NOT PREDICTIVE BEFORE

01:55:30 SUPER TUESDAY. ON SUPER TUESDAY, IT STARTS TO

01:55:37 GET ABOUT A THIRD MORE PREDICTIVE, AND THAT INCREASES

01:55:40 BY A THIRD AGAIN IN JUNE, JULY, AND THEN IN OCTOBER.

01:55:44 WHAT YOU SAW FROM THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY OVER THE

01:55:48 WEEKEND WAS A SUBSTANTIAL AD BUY WHICH LENDS CREDENCE TO MY

01:55:50 THESIS. THEY WILL BE A TREMENDOUS

01:55:55 AMOUNT OF CAMPAIGNING TO GET THOSE FINAL SWING VOTERS IN THE

01:55:59 OCTOBER PERIOD, WHICH IS WHEN THEY BOUGHT I WANT TO SAY ABOUT

01:56:03 $200 MILLION WORTH OF ADS IN THE SWING STATES.

01:56:07 POLLING SUGGESTS THERE IS A

01:56:13 TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF, NOT APPREHENSION, BUT UNWILLINGNESS

01:56:15 TO SAY THAT BIDEN IS OUR CANDIDATE.

01:56:18 WE HAVE THE CONFLICTING DATA SET OF SOUTH CAROLINA YESTERDAY

01:56:22 WHICH WENT 96% FOR BIDEN. THERE IS NO LACK OF CLARITY

01:56:24 THERE.

01:56:25 THAT IS A RESOUNDING VICTORY, AS HIS COMPETITORS POINTED OUT

01:56:32 THEMSELVES. I THINK THE POLLING IS SHOWING

01:56:36 US THERE IS A SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION THAT IS LARGER FOR

01:56:41 DEMOCRATS AND INDEPENDENTS THAT IS UNDECIDED, AND MOST OF THE

01:56:43 ROOM TO GAIN STAND WITH BIDEN. REPUBLICANS ARE CLEAR THAT THEY

01:56:46 ARE VOTING FOR TRUMP. ANNMARIE: A LOT OF THE POLLING SHOWS THAT

01:56:51 THIS IS ALSO A REMATCH THAT AMERICANS DON'T WANT TO SEE.

01:56:55 WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THESE THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATES?

01:57:00 WHERE DOES HE DRAW FROM, TRUMP VOTERS OR BIDEN VOTERS?

01:57:03 HENRIETTA: SOME OF THAT YOU'LL SEE FROM

01:57:08 THE AGE DEMOGRAPHICS, WHITE VERSUS BLACK VERSUS OTHER

01:57:09 MINORITIES MAKE UP. THOSE VOTERS ARE ALSO TRYING TO

01:57:15 SEND A MESSAGE WHICH IS VERY MUCH AKIN TO WHAT WE SAW WITH

01:57:16 BERNIE SANDERS. NOT AT THE TWO OF THEM ARE

01:57:20 SIMILAR CANDIDATES, BUT THERE

01:57:26 IS A WHOLE DUCK BOAT -- VOTE SAYING I WANT TO PUSH THE

01:57:27 DIRECTION.

01:57:34 JOE BIDEN HAS TACKED MORE TOWARD THE MIDDLE RECENTLY.

01:57:37 THERE WAS PROFOUND RESENTMENT WITH THINGS LIKE THE BIPARTISAN

01:57:41 INFRASTRUCTURE ACT.

01:57:43 YOU HAD A STANDOFF BETWEEN PROGRESSIVES AND THE

01:57:48 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

01:57:51 I SEE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF COROLLARY BETWEEN THE 2020

01:57:53 ELECTION AND THIS ONE.

01:58:00 IN FACT, IF YOU LAYER ON TOP OF THAT, ANY AMALGAMATION OF DATA

01:58:03 FROM THE LAST SIX MONTH OF POLLING, YOU WILL SEE THAT SAME

01:58:07 SKEW OF VOTERS WHO WAS HOPING FOR SOMEONE ELSE ARE SAYING

01:58:12 THEY WOULD GO WITH RFK, MARION WILL LISTEN, OTHER CANDIDATES,

01:58:20 AND THEN THEY REALIZE WE ARE A TWO PARTY SYSTEM, AND THERE IS

01:58:23 NO CHANCE THAT A UNICORN COMES INTO THE RACE.

01:58:28 A LOT OF THE POLLING SUGGESTS THAT'S POSSIBLE, THAT'S FINE.

01:58:33 USUALLY THAT STARTS TO DIMINISH ON SUPER TUESDAY, WHICH IS

01:58:34 MARCH 5. ANNMARIE: OUR POLLING SHOWS THAT AS THE

01:58:40 ECONOMY IS GETTING BETTER, IMMIGRATION BECOMES AN ISSUE.

01:58:42 YOU KNOW THAT THE SENATE RELEASED THE TEXT OF THE

01:58:44 SUPPLEMENTAL. DO YOU THINK THERE IS A CHANCE

01:58:47 THAT THIS DEAL WILL BE REACHED? TERRY HAYNES PUTTING IT AT 60%

01:58:51 PROBABILITY. I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW YOUR

01:58:54 PERCENTAGE. HENRIETTA: WITH ALL DO RESPECT, I THINK

01:58:59 60% IS INORDINATELY HIGH. YOU CAN GET PIECEMEAL BUCKETS

01:59:06 ON SPENDING IN UKRAINE AND ISRAEL, AS WE HAVE THE

01:59:07 CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS AND THE RISK FOR GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN

01:59:12 THE NEXT THREE MONTHS, BUT THERE IS A TERM OF THE SUMMIT

01:59:15 OF DISCONNECT ON THE STREET ABOUT THIS BILL AND ALSO THE

01:59:19 TAX BILL. THAT IS A $78 BILLION TAX

01:59:21 PACKAGE THAT I THINK HAS A LOT OF POLITICAL SIMILARITIES TO

01:59:24 THE BORDER IN UKRAINE AID PACKAGE. IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS

01:59:28 ABSOLUTELY A WIN FOR ALL MEMBERS OF CONGRESS.

01:59:38 THE REALITY IS, I DON'T THINK YOU WILL SEE EITHER OF THOSE

01:59:40 BILLS -- DEFINITELY NOT THE TAX BILL.

01:59:42 IT IS JUST A HUGE POLITICAL BOON FOR THE INCUMBENT ON BOTH

01:59:45 OF THESE. THAT IS WHY TRUMP HAS COME OUT

01:59:48 AGAINST IT. REPUBLICAN MEMBERS IN THE HOUSE

01:59:53 ARE LAMBASTING IT EVEN BEFORE THEY SEE THE TEXT.

01:59:56 THERE IS MISINFORMATION OUT THERE.

01:59:58 I DON'T SEE THIS BILL PASSING THE HOUSE. JONATHAN:

02:00:02 WE SPEND SO MUCH TIME TALKING ABOUT THESE THINGS THAT NEVER

02:00:07 GET DONE. EVERY SICKLE TIME.

02:00:08 HENRIETTA TREYZ OF VEDA PARTNERS. LISA:

02:00:11 TO THAT POINT, HOW DO YOU STRIP OUT THE NOISE?

02:00:15 SABINA, I WANT YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT.

02:00:18 WHAT DO YOU PAY ATTENTION TO THAT IS ACTUALLY MARKET MOVING

02:00:20 VERSUS WHAT WE ALWAYS GET? SAVITA:

02:00:26 WHAT IS INTERESTING, IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA, THERE IS ONE

02:00:30 UNEQUIVOCAL STATEMENT I CAN MAKE WITH TOTAL CONFIDENCE.

02:00:34 NOBODY IS BETTING ON A CYCLICAL RECOVERY WHEN IT COMES TO

02:00:38 PROFESSIONAL INVESTORS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE AVERAGE

02:00:41 HEDGE FUND, MUTUAL FUND, EVEN THE AVERAGE INVESTOR, WE DON'T

02:00:45 OWN ENERGY OR FINANCIALS OR HIGH BETA.

02:00:53 THE EXPOSURE IS AT ALMOST THE LOWEST LEVEL SINCE WE HAVE SEEN

02:00:54 SINCE THE FINANCIAL CRISIS. DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE

02:00:59 ECONOMY SEEMS TO BE RUNNING MAYBE TWO HOT, THERE IS NO BID

02:01:02 ON THAT THEORY. JONATHAN:

02:01:08 I REMEMBER ALL OF OUR CONVERSATIONS, YOU SAID THE

02:01:09 BIGGEST RISK WAS UPSIDE RISKS TO EQUITIES.

02:01:12 LET'S PUT PRICE TARGET TO ONE SIDE.

02:01:15 WHAT IS THE BIGGEST RISK FOR 24? SAVITA:

02:01:20 THE BIGGEST RISK TO THE S&P 500 IN THE NEAR TERM IS UPSIDE.

02:01:25 OUR TARGET OF 5000 IS PROBABLY TOO LOW IN THE NEAR TERM.

02:01:30 THE REASON WE ARE NOT AS OPTIMISTIC ON STOCKS TODAY IS

02:01:34 THAT WE HAVE SEEN THIS PERCOLATING POSITIVE SENTIMENT

02:01:39 ESPECIALLY AROUND THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, THE AREA OF

02:01:43 ABJECT EUPHORIA. THAT AREA OF THE MARKET IS AT

02:01:48 RISK BUT I DO SEE THIS LACK OF REAL CONVICTION IN STOCKS

02:01:49 OUTPERFORMING BONDS. I THINK CASH, STOCKS, THEN

02:01:53 BONDS. THAT IS A LOT OF YOU WANT TO

02:01:55 HAVE. JONATHAN: GREAT TO SEE YOU AS ALWAYS.

02:02:01 SAVITA SUBRAMANIAN OF BANK OF AMERICA.

02:02:03 THIS FROM GOLDMAN MOMENTS AGO. WE PUBLISHED OUR FIRST FORECAST

02:02:09 BACK TO MAY AFTER CHAIR POWELL SET A MARCH BASE CUT IS NOT THE

02:02:10 CASE. WE SEE A RISK THAT IT COULD

02:02:15 COME LATER AFTER THE 60 MINUTES INTERVIEW. LISA:

02:02:19 THE FACT THAT JAY POWELL WAS NOT TALKING ABOUT MARCH, SAID

02:02:22 IT WAS NOT LIKELY BEFORE SEEING THE JOBS REPORT.

02:02:26 IT WAS NOT JUST AN ACCIDENTAL SLIP IN RESPONSE TO A REPORTER.

02:02:29 THIS WAS A DELIBERATE POINT OF VIEW. JONATHAN:

02:02:34 COMING UP, THAT DISCUSSION.

02:02:40 FRANCES DONALD FROM MANULIFE ON MY IT MAY BE TOO EARLY FOR

02:02:42 THE FED TO CUT RATES. ABOUT ONE HOUR AWAY FROM THE

02:02:45 OPENING BELL. EQUITIES ON THE S&P 500

02:02:49 SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE.

02:03:06 JONATHAN: 60 MINUTES AWAY FROM THE

02:03:08 OPENING BELL. EQUITIES PULLING BACK ON THE

02:03:11 S&P 500, DOWN A QUARTER PERCENT. AMAZING TO THINK ABOUT THE WEEK

02:03:17 THAT WE DID GET EVEN AFTER THE BIGGEST ONE-DAY DROP GOING BACK

02:03:20 TO SEPTEMBER. EQUITIES ARE DOING OK. LISA:

02:03:26 WE HAVE TO KEEP EMPHASIZING, THE EARNINGS OF META-, AMAZON

02:03:30 REALLY HIGHLIGHTED HOW THE BIG TECH NAMES HAVE DRIVEN THIS

02:03:31 THROUGH THE CASH THEY GENERATE. JONATHAN:

02:03:34 QUITE A SELLOFF IN THE TREASURY MARKET.

02:03:39 10-YEAR YIELD UP BY ALMOST 10 BASIS POINTS. 4.11.

02:03:45 ON THE TWO-YEAR, 4.43. I MENTIONED THAT GOLDMAN SACHS

02:03:48 NOTE. AFTER CHAIRMAN POWELL, THEY

02:03:53 PUSH THAT OUT TO ME. AFTER THE 60 MINUTES INTERVIEW,

02:03:58 THE RISK IS NOW PUSHED OUT EVEN FURTHER.

02:04:03 YOU HAVE BREEDS SOME LIKED INTO THIS CONVERSATION EARLIER.

02:04:06 THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT. WHY WOULD IT SO IMPORTANT TO

02:04:09 YOU AND TO OTHERS? LISA:

02:04:15 THERE WAS SPECULATION HE WAS THROWING OUT MARCH AS AN

02:04:19 OFF-THE-CUFF WAY TO REPORTERS, NOT OUR BASE CASE FOR IT TO BE

02:04:20 MARCH. ALMOST LIKE AND BUBBLED OUT.

02:04:29 THE FACT THAT HE LAID OUT THE CASE, WHY HE IS NOT INTERESTED

02:04:32 IN CUTTING RATES IN MARCH AND THIS 60 MINUTES INTERVIEW THAT

02:04:37 WAS TAPED BEFORE WE GOT THE FRIDAY DATA, TO ME, WAS A GAME

02:04:38 CHANGER. THEIR BIAS IS TOWARD WAITING TO

02:04:42 MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE ACCURATE DATA. ANNMARIE:

02:04:47 HE DOUBLED DOWN ON NOT CUTTING IN MARCH BEFORE THE U.S.

02:04:48 JOBS DATA. WHAT IF HE HAD SAID THAT AND

02:04:52 THIS WAS TAPED SATURDAY MORNING? JONATHAN:

02:04:57 I BELIEVE MIKE MCKEE IS CATCHING UP WITH MR. GOOLSBY

02:05:00 FROM CHICAGO, SO LOOK OUT FOR THAT THIS MORNING.

02:05:04 CHINESE STOCKS SEEING ANOTHER VOLATILE SESSION AS INVESTORS

02:05:10 HOPE FOR A STABILIZATION OF THE EQUITY MARKET.

02:05:12 THE SECURITIES REGULATORS SAID IT WOULD TAKE STEPS TO PREVENT

02:05:17 RISK WITHOUT PROVIDING MANY DETAILS. MARGIN CALLS AND FORCED

02:05:20 LIQUIDATI
