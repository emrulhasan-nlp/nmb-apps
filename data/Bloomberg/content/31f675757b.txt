Mao Zedong was wrong: Political power doesn’t come out of the barrel of a gun. Another late philosopher was closer to the truth: “Nothing is more political than food.”

That was Anthony Bourdain, whose 2017 declaration in a New Yorker podcast is cited in Alex Prud’homme’s Dinner with the Presidents: Food, Politics, and a History of Breaking Bread at the White House. The book explores the use of food in diplomacy, backroom hardball, social climbing and nation building from George Washington to Joe Biden. Another recent book, Witold Szablowski’s What’s Cooking in the Kremlin: From Rasputin to Putin, How Russia Built an Empire with a Knife and Fork, looks at how a succession of rulers from the last tsar to the current overlord marshalled the kitchen for the greater glory of the Motherland. Despite the unwieldy, colon-tethered titles, both books are revelatory examinations of cooking and food in the rough-and-tumble of imperium.
