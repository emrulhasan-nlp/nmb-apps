Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has spent most of his political career on a tightrope and he’s betting the future of Spain on his ability to pull off another outrageous balancing act.

Battling to secure a third term after losing July’s election, Sanchez’s Socialist party on Thursday agreed amnesties for hundreds of Catalan separatists who tried to break up Spain six years ago. In exchange, the 51-year-old Socialist will get the parliamentary support he needs to take office for a third term and Spanish conservatives are outraged.
