Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a summit in Paris on Sunday to negotiate a return of hostages held by Hamas in exchange for a cease-fire in Gaza was “constructive,” but “significant gaps” remain.

Those differences will be discussed at additional meetings this week, according to a statement from Netanyahu’s office.
