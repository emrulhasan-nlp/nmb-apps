Consumer prices in India continued to slide in April, giving the central bank room to keep rates on hold after an aggressive tightening campaign dampened demand and muddled the wider outlook for the economy.

Inflation rose 4.70% last month from a year earlier, the slowest pace since October 2021, according to data released by the Statistics Ministry on Friday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists was for a 4.76% gain. A third straight month of cooling prices brings the marker closer to the mid-point of the Reserve Bank of Indiaâ€™s 2%-6% target.
