A Sudanese gold mining company linked to the Russian mercenary Wagner Group has suspended operations because of conflict in the North African nation.

Al-Sawlaj Gold Mining Co. has been shuttered since mid-April and its Russian staff have been evacuated, Huweyda Mursal, a legal adviser to the company, said by phone. The company owns a gold-tailing processing facility near Atbara, a city 280 kilometers (174 miles) north of the capital, Khartoum.
