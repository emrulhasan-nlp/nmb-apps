US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will no doubt press to establish “guardrails” — safeguards against accidental clashes between the US and Chinese militaries — during his visit to Beijing this weekend. Chinese leaders are equally certain to resist. They’d be making a mistake.

As with many other disagreements between the two rivals, China and the US have diametrically opposed views on the need for military hotlines and formal codes of conduct at sea and in the air. Informed by its experience of détente with the Soviet Union during the Cold War, the US believes that adversaries can only safely jostle with each other in unfriendly military and intelligence activities if they can agree to rules designed to prevent accidental conflicts. Such safeguards, as President Joe Biden told President Xi Jinping at a virtual summit in November 2021, are only “commonsense.”
