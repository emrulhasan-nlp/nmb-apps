00:15 >> TECH CONTINUES TO CRUSH IT AT BASICALLY EVERY ANGLE.

00:19 >> NOTHING WRONG WITH TECH, THESE COMPANIES HAVE A LOT OF

00:23 CASH. IT IS JUST EVERYONE IS IN LOVE

00:27 WITH THEM.

00:28 >> EARNINGS ARE EARNINGS AND CASH IS CASH.

00:29 THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT.

00:33 >> THE FED IS IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR AND WE ARE FOCUSED ON

00:35 OTHER THINGS. WE ARE WILLING TO TRADE RATE

00:37 CUTS FOR EARNINGS GROWTH.

00:42 >> THIS IS "BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE SURVEILLANCE"

00:45 WITH JONATHAN FERRO, LISA ABRAMOWICZ, AND ANNMARIE

00:50 HORDERN. JONATHAN: LISA IS BACK. GOOD MORNING, GOOD MORNING.

00:57 THIS IS "BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE" WRAPPING UP APRIL WITH A MONTH

01:01 OF LOSSES POTENTIALLY ON THE SCREEN.

01:04 DOWN MORE THAN 2% ON THE S&P FOR APRIL.

01:06 THE SMALL CAPS HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY HAMMERED THE END OF

01:10 MARCH, THE ROTATION IS COMING, A BIG DOWNDRAFT FOR THE SMALL

01:14 CAPS SO FAR THIS MONTH, SNAPPING FIVE STRAIGHT MONTHS

01:16 OF GAINS FOR EQUITIES ON THE S&P 500.

01:19 BRAMO, APRIL HAS BEEN A BUMPY RIDE. LISA:

01:23 PARTLY BECAUSE THAT IS THE SOUND OF THE NARRATIVE BREAKING

01:25 -- OR MAYBE THE NARRATIVE SHIFTING.

01:29 HE BASICALLY SAID HIGHER INFLATION IS FINE FOR STOCKS

01:32 AND EARNINGS. IF YIELDS STAY HERE IT WILL BE

01:37 OK, EVERYTHING IS FINE. YIELDS ARE HIGH FOR THE RIGHT

01:38 REASONS. ARE THEY? THAT IS THE ANGST YOU ARE

01:42 FEELING. JONATHAN: THE BOND MARKET, BREAKING UP

01:48 THE 10 YEAR. THE TWO-YEAR, HIGH BY 35 BASIS

01:51 POINTS.

01:58 THE 10 YEAR UP BY MORE THAN 40. I REMEMBER A FEW CONVERSATIONS

02:00 WE HAD THIS MONTH. JUST A FEW. STEVE SAID THAT THIS FEDERAL

02:03 RESERVE WANTS TO COUNT INTEREST RATES.HE SAID THAT THIS DATA IS

02:04 NOT COOPERATING. THE DATA THIS MONTH HAS NOT

02:06 COOPERATED. ANNMARIE:

02:13 WHICH IS WHY ALL OF THE GUESTS TOLD US YESTERDAY THAT THIS

02:15 WEEK'S FED MEETING WILL BE A SNOOZE FEST. HE WILL BASICALLY

02:20 TAKE EARNINGS GROWTH, WHICH WE HAD 80% BEATING ESTIMATES,

02:24 OVERFED CUTS. -- OVER FED CUTS.

02:30 JONATHAN: U.S. EXCEPTIONALISM. THAT SHIFTED INTO THE PROSPECT

02:34 OF PEAK U.S. EXCEPTIONALISM. CHINA BETTER THAN EXPECTED.

02:41 THE TOP FOUR EUROZONE ECONOMIES, ALL BEATING

02:43 EXPECTATIONS FOR FIRST-QUARTER GDP.

02:45 DO YOU SENSE THAT THE TIDE IS STARTING TO TURN A LITTLE BIT?

02:48 LISA: THAT THE SCENARIO OVER THERE IS

02:51 RHYMING WITH SCENARIO OVER HERE. GDP HOTTER THAN EXPECTED AND

02:56 INFLATION INCREMENTALLY IN GERMANY AND FRANCE COMING IN

02:58 HIGHER THAN EXPECTED AS WELL. IT RAISES THE QUESTION, DOES

03:02 THIS GIVE THE ECB ROOM TO CUT RATES AND BE STRONGER?

03:05 I'M SURPRISED WE DIDN'T SEE MORE OF A REACTION IN THE EURO.

03:08 I THOUGHT THIS IS SOMETHING YOU COULD SEE STRENGTH POP IN.

03:12 ANNMARIE: THIS WILL BE A HUGE TAILWIND

03:16 INTO THE ECB CUTTING RATES IN JUNE IF THE ECONOMIES ARE

03:18 ALREADY DOWN. YES, EVERYONE WILL WANT TO TALK

03:21 ABOUT GERMANY BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES THAT WERE COMING OUT

03:25 AT THE MOMENT. IT IS THE PERIPHERAL.

03:29 IT IS SOUTHERN EUROPE WE'VE SEEN THE BANK OUT OF THE

03:32 PANDEMIC HAVING TO DO WITH TOURISM AND THE FACT THAT THEY

03:35 WERE NOT AS RELIANT ON RUSSIAN OIL AND GAS.

03:37 FOR YEARS THEY HAVE BEEN MORE DEPENDENT ON RENEWABLES.

03:40 JONATHAN: CHINA, THE COMMODITY MARKET

03:42 THINGS HAVE STARTED TO WAKE UP TIME.

03:52 IRON ORE TO THE BIGGEST MONTH SINCE 2022.

03:53 IS THIS A TURN ACROSS COMMODITY MARKETS? LISA:

03:57 SO MANY PEOPLE COMING OUT SAYING THAT THAT IS A POSITIVE

03:58 BECAUSE THAT MEANS THEY WILL HIT THEIR 5% GOAL.

04:03 TALK ABOUT OVERCAPACITY AND OVERSUPPLY.

04:05 IT'S COMING FROM THE INDUSTRIAL SIDE.

04:07 A LOT OF ECONOMISTS SAY THEY SHOULD PUT MORE MONEY INTO THIS.

04:09 GUESS WHAT THAT WILL DO. THIS RAISES THE QUESTION OF, IF

04:14 YOU SEE THEIR MARGINS BEING CRUNCHED BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT

04:20 IS FUNDING IT, IT RAISES -- JONATHAN:

04:22 THAT IS INFLATION THAT THE WORLD NEEDS AND EUROPE AND

04:23 AMERICA WANTS? NO? LISA:

04:29 IT IS ON SALE AND WE ARE NOT SAYING THANK YOU THIS TIME.

04:30 THAT IS WHERE WE ARE AT.

04:32 JONATHAN: -0.1% PULLING BACK ON THE S&P

04:36 500 JUST A TOUCH. DOWN MORE ON THE MONTH SO FAR.

04:41 YIELDS OF BY SINGLE BASIS POINT ON THE 10-YEAR.

04:44 COMING UP, WE WILL CHECK IN

04:50 WITH EVERCORE AHEAD OF AMAZON EARNINGS, ISRAEL-THOMAS TALKS,

04:54 AND A FORMER FED ECONOMIST SAYING THAT A STRONGER ECONOMY

04:55 SHOULDN'T DELAY RATE CUTS. WE WILL BEGIN WITH OUR TOP

05:02 STORY OF CORPORATE AMERICA BEATING EXPECTATIONS.

05:05 BLOOMBERG REPORTING THAT 80% OF COMPANIES HAVE OUTPERFORMED SO

05:06 FAR. EVERCORE LOOKING TO EARNINGS IN

05:09 THE FED DECISION TOMORROW SAYING THAT WHILE THE PHASE OUT

05:13 OF THE BASELINE IS BEING MET WITH ROCKET VOLATILITY AND A

05:15 CORRECTION, DOESN'T MEAN THE END OF THE CYCLICAL BULL MARKET.

05:19 GOOD MORNING TO YOU. YOUR NOTE THIS MORNING GOT THE

05:26 ATTENTION OF ME AND LISA AND THE TITLE IN THE QUESTION.

05:32 ALL OF THESE CRITICAL EVENTS, THE EARNINGS, THE DATA, TAKES A

05:36 BACKSEAT TO WIN THE MEDIA POPS THE QUESTION TO JAY POWELL OUT

05:38 THE PRESSER. COULD YOU SEE THE NEXT MOVE

05:40 BEING A RATE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES?

05:45 WHEN THAT QUESTION IS ASKED BY SOMEONE NO DOUBT LIKE MIKE

05:47 MCKEE, HOW DOES HE ANSWER IT? JULIAN:

05:53 WE HAVE HAD AN OVERABUNDANCE OF THINGS.

05:54 AN OVERABUNDANCE OF GROWTH. THE STRENGTH IS PROBABLY BETTER

05:59 THAN ANYONE COULD HAVE EXPECTED GIVEN THAT YOU'VE HAD SOFT

06:01 SPOTS IN THE REST OF THE WORLD. AND AS YOU ADDRESS GETTING

06:07 BETTER, ALSO, INFLATION HAS BEEN HOTTER THAN EXPECTED.

06:11 SO, THE PERVERSE LOGIC OF FINANCIAL MARKETS IS, IT IS

06:15 ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT THE FED CHAIR COULD LEAD US TO A PATH

06:19 WHERE THERE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE TIGHTENING OF FINANCIAL

06:21 CONDITIONS. ANSWERING THAT QUESTION, WHICH

06:26 ULTIMATELY GIVES YOU THE ROOM, SEVERAL MONTHS HENCE, TO MAKE

06:29 THAT RATE CUT. WE THINK THAT THERE COULD BE

06:33 SOME VOLATILITY ON WEDNESDAY. LISA:

06:34 ARE YOU SAYING THIS IS A FED CHAIR THAT WANTS TO REDUCE

06:37 MARKET SELLOFF? JULIAN: I DON'T THINK THAT HE WOULD BE

06:41 INCREDIBLY UNHAPPY ABOUT IT.

06:47 AGAIN, THIS IS THE CONUNDRUM WHERE THEY HAVE GOTTEN

06:51 THEMSELVES STUCK INTO BECAUSE OF THE SUCCESS OF THE DOVISH

06:55 PIVOT IN A LOT OF WAYS WARDING OFF A POTENTIAL DOWNTURN.

07:01 FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW, WE HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT IT HAS BEEN

07:03 AT HEINEMAN'S COURT. THAT LAST MILE IN INFLATION HAS

07:08 TO BE ACCOMPANIED BY SLOWER ECONOMY. LISA:

07:13 HOW MUCH DID THE PIVOT LAST YEAR BECAUSE INFLATION TO BE

07:15 STICKIER AND PUSH THE FED FURTHER FROM THEIR

07:18 GOAL? HOW MUCH OF A SELLOFF DO YOU

07:22 THINK THAT THE FED NEEDS TO GET BACK ON TRACK WITH 3, 2, OR

07:23 EVEN ONE RATE CUT THIS YEAR? JULIAN:

07:27 I DON'T THINK THAT THERE IS A COINCIDENCE THAT WHEN YOU LOOK

07:32 AT APRIL AND EVERYONE HAS TALKED ABOUT THE STATISTICS OF

07:35 THE MONTH OF APRIL, AN ELECTION YEAR BEING A POSITIVE MONTH,

07:39 AND LOW AND BEHOLD WE HAVE GOTTEN WHAT WE GOT LAST YEAR

07:43 ESSENTIALLY WHEN RATES APPROACHED 5%, STOCKS STALL ED.

07:50 YOU CAN FRANKLY GET A SCENARIO WHEN MARKETS CORRECT IN BOTH

07:55 TIME AND PRICE AND WE WIND OUR WAY DOWN.

07:58 THE FACT THAT THE ANIMAL SPIRITS HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT

08:00 CONTAINED IN THE MONTH OF APRIL IS GOING TO END UP ULTIMATELY

08:03 WORKING IN THE FED'S FAVOR. JONATHAN:

08:09 WOULD YOU LIKE A RECIPE FOR BEARISHNESS FROM CHEF MARCO?

08:14 THE GROWTH POLICY TRADE-OFF COULD MOVE AWAY FROM GOLDILOCKS

08:19 WITH A RISK OF CONCENTRATION REVERSAL, TO STEEP FOR EARNINGS

08:21 ACCELERATION. IT IS A LONG LIST. WHAT ARE YOU

08:23 THE MOST CONCERNED ABOUT? JULIAN:

08:28 THE CONCEPT OF BEING INCREDIBLY CONCERNED ABOUT A DRAWDOWN LIKE

08:32 LAST YEAR IS A BIT OF A RED HERRING.

08:40 AN AVERAGE DRAWDOWN IN AN AVERAGE NON-RECESSION YEAR IS

08:42 13%. WE WERE SPOILED BY LAST YEAR.

08:47 WE ONLY WENT DOWN 10%. THE VIX IS 14% VERSUS A AVERAGE

08:52 OF 19.5. WE SHOULD BE USED TO TOMORROW

08:54 VOLATILITY. WHEN WE THINK ABOUT EVERYTHING

08:57 GOING ON IN THE WORLD AND WE THINK ABOUT WHAT WE WILL HAVE

09:03 TO DO ON NOVEMBER 5, IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT WE GET THAT

09:04 VOLATILITY. WE THINK THAT WE GET IT AND WE

09:10 THINK THAT IT IS GOING TO BE OK FOR MARKETS. LISA:

09:13 I HAVE A LOT OF TIME FOR YOUR RECIPES. BEAR RATATOUILLE.

09:19 JONATHAN: CHEF MARCO. LISA: WE HAVE DIFFERENT RECIPES

09:24 COMING TOGETHER AND SOME PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE RECIPE

09:28 THIS WEEK FOR RISK OUTSIDE OF THE FED MEETING.

09:30 WE HAD A LITANY OF PEOPLE OPENING THE SHOW SAYING THAT

09:33 THE FED WAS LESS RELEVANT, EVEN IF SOMEONE POPS THE INCREDIBLE

09:35 QUESTION. IT IS ABOUT EARNINGS AND SOME

09:38 OF THE EMPLOYMENT DATA WE GET. COULD THAT BE MORE OF A RISK IN

09:43 A SIGNIFICANT WAY? OR ULTIMATELY THIS COMES DOWN

09:47 TO RATES AND PEOPLE AREN'T ADMITTING IT? JULIAN:

09:53 IF YOU LOOK AT THE DAY TO DAY, THERE IS NO DOUBT EARNINGS HAVE

09:58 HAD A DAY-TO-DAY AFFECT. UPS AND DOWNS.

10:03 FRANKLY, THE GREATER CORRELATION HAS BEEN WHAT

10:05 POSITIONING LOOKS LIKE. THE STOCKS WITH MASSIVE AMOUNTS

10:09 OF SHORTS HAVE SEEN BETTER REACTIONS.

10:12 WE HAVE SEEN GAPS IN SOME OF THE MAJOR NAMES.

10:18 STOCKS WHERE THERE ARE NOT SHORTS IN PLACES LIKE

10:21 INDUSTRIALS, TRUCKING IN PARTICULAR, WHERE THERE IS THE

10:23 POTENTIAL THAT THEIR MESSAGE IS GOING TO BE THAT THE ECONOMY

10:26 WILL SLOW LATER INTO THE YEAR OR NEXT YEAR, YOU HAVE SEEN

10:30 POOR REACTIONS. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT

10:35 LONG-TERM, AND THIS IS WHY DESPITE OUR VIEW OF A

10:39 CORRECTION PHASE WE ARE OPTIMISTIC.

10:44 EARNINGS DRIVE STOCKS AND EARNINGS BY AND LARGE ARE NOT

10:48 GREAT BUT OK ENOUGH. ANNMARIE: YOU MENTIONED VOLATILITY, YOU

10:53 ARE EMBRACING IT, HOW DO YOU POSITION FOR IT? JULIAN:

10:58 THERE IS A TRIDENT TRUE TRACK RECORD OF SECTOR -- TRIED AND

11:03 TRUE TRACK RECORD OF SECTOR OUTPERFORMANCE BETWEEN THE LAST

11:09 FED HIKE AND FIRST

11:10 CUT.THE FIRST CUT CONTINUES TO GET PUSHED OUT IN TIME.

11:14 COMMUNICATION SERVICES AND THE MORE DEFENSIVE SECTORS LIKE

11:16 HEALTH CARE AND CONSUMER STAPLES, WHICH, IN FACT, IF YOU

11:20 START SEEING HIGHER RATES HAVE THAT DAMPENING EFFECT ON ANIMAL

11:23 SPIRITS, ON SENTIMENT, THOSE WILL START TO PERFORM EVEN

11:27 BETTER. THE OTHER THING THAT WE WANT TO

11:29 DO IS FULLY EMBRACE WHAT WE CALL THE AI REVOLUTION.

11:33 THE PROBLEM WITH THAT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IS THAT THERE HAS

11:36 BEEN AN UNBELIEVABLE AMOUNT OF VOLATILITY IN THESE STOCKS IN

11:39 RECENT WEEKS FOR THE UPSIDE AND THE DOWNSIDE.

11:43 WHAT YOU DO IS YOU BUY STOCKS AND YOU USE OPTIONS HEDGES SO

11:44 YOU CAN SLEEP AT NIGHT. JONATHAN: THAT IS HELPFUL.

11:48 THANK YOU. PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU DROP 10%

11:54 ON ANY GIVEN DAY ON NVIDIA FOR NO GIVEN REASON.

12:01 DOLLAR-YOU AND, LET'S TALK -- DOLLAR- YEN LET'S TALK ABOUT

12:03 THAT. YESTERDAY WE BROKE 160

12:05 BRIEFLY. THE GAP LOWER HAS BEEN A

12:10 MYSTERY. THE WALL STREET JOURNAL INITIALLY REPORTING THERE WAS

12:12 INTERVENTION BASED ON THEIR SOURCES.

12:13 WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THE DATA. LISA:

12:17 THE DATA SAYS THAT ACCORDING TO SOME OF THEIR ACCOUNTS IT SHOWS

12:24 ABOUT ¥5.5 TRILLION WORTH OF INTERVENTION IN THEIR CURRENCY.

12:25 THAT IS ABOUT $35 BILLION. WE ARE LOOKING AT A TRIAL

12:30 BALLOON. HOW MUCH CAN THEY DO FOR THEIR

12:33 MONEY AS THEY TRY TO GET AHEAD OF A FEDERAL RESERVE AND GET

12:37 CONTROL? WHAT IS SUCCESSFUL? THE JURY IS OUT BECAUSE THIS IS

12:42 BASICALLY BUYING TIME BEFORE YOU GET SOMETHING MORE

12:43 DEFINITIVE ON THE U.S. SIDE. JONATHAN:

12:47 YOU MENTIONED THE CLOSE OUT AT DEUTSCHE BANK.

12:51 THE BANK OF JAPAN NEEDS TO ENGINEER AN EXPEDITED HIKING

12:55 CYCLE SIMILAR TO THE POST-COVID EXPERIENCES OF A CENTRAL BANKS

12:58 TO PUT A FLOOR OR CEILING ON TOP OF DOLLAR-YEN. LISA:

13:02 WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE BANK OF JAPAN A LACK OF WILLINGNESS TO

13:04 DO SO. THEY'RE COUNTING ON THE FED IN

13:07 THE MEANTIME COMING OUT A LITTLE MORE DOVISH THEN THE

13:10 MARKET IS EXPECTING, WHICH SOME PEOPLE THINK IS POSSIBLE.

13:13 ARE THEY TRYING TO SEE, HOW MUCH BANG CAN WE GET JONATHAN:

13:14 FOR OUR BUCK? JONATHAN:WHEN MIKE MCKEE POPS THE QUESTION IN

13:19 TOMORROW'S NEWS CONFERENCE THE MAKE OF JAPAN IS HOPING THAT HE

13:20 SAYS NO HIKES. LISA: WILL YOU, FED CHAIR J POWELL,

13:28 POSSIBLY THINK ABOUT MAKING A YEN? JONATHAN: NO.

13:31 THAT IS HOW THAT PROPOSAL IS GOING TO GO. THANK YOU, SIR.

13:37 YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF WITH DANI BURGER. DANI:

13:44 THE HSBC CHIEF EXECUTIVE IS STEPPING DOWN.

13:47 HE WAS AT THE JOB FOR NEARLY FIVE YEARS.

13:48 THE BOARD HAS STARTED THE FORMAL PROCESS TO FIND A

13:49 SUCCESSOR. QUINN SAID WE HAVE TO GIVE 100%

13:55 IF NOT 120 PERCENT. AND THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY

13:57 ACHIEVE A BALANCE IN LIFE THAT I WANTED.

14:02 HE IS LEAVING AT A HIGH. REPORTING A BEAT ON PROFITS AT

14:06 83 BILLION-DOLLAR BUYBACK. IT IS ALSO BEEN A BUSY WEEK FOR

14:13 PARAMOUNT GLOBAL WITH THE COMPANY'S CEO STEPPING DOWN

14:15 REPLACED BY THREE SENIOR EXECUTIVES.

14:19 ALSO PARAMOUNT REPORTING FIRST-QUARTER EARNINGS THAT

14:22 BEAT ESTIMATES HELPED BY THE CBS BROADCAST OF THE SUPER BOWL

14:26 IN FEBRUARY AND, DARE I SAY, TAYLOR SWIFT'S APPEARANCE.

14:30 SKY DANCE MEDIA IS NEGOTIATING A DEAL FOR THE COMPANY OF THIS

14:35 SEEMS MORE LIKELY WITH BOB OUT. BOEING RAISED $10 BILLION

14:39 YESTERDAY IN A BOND SALE TO EASE FINANCIAL STRAINS.

14:42 IT ATTRACTED $77 BILLION IN ORDERS AND THE DEMAND WAS

14:47 HELPED BY BOEING DANGLING A STRONG YIELD PREMIUM, BUT IT IS

14:49 A SIGN THAT THE U.S. CREDIT MARKET IS WIDE OPEN

14:54 DESPITE A SHIFT THAT MORE INSATIABLE DEMAND FOR ISSUANCE

14:55 THAN PROSPECTS FOR BOEING'S CREDIT.

14:57 THAT IS YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF. JONATHAN:

15:03 WE WILL CATCH UP WITH DANI IN 30 MINUTES.

15:05 THAT PROPOSAL FELT LIKE AN AWKWARD FAN CAM AT BASKETBALL.

15:08 HAVE YOU SEEN THOSE VIDEOS WHERE YOU ARE ON ONE KNEE AND

15:10 THE GIRL RUNS OFF? IT IS VERY UPSETTING.

15:16 LISA: THAT POPULATES THE AUTOMATIC

15:17 ALGORITHM IN YOUR TWITTER FEED? JONATHAN:

15:20 I GET WOMEN RUNNING AWAY. NEXT, THE CEASE-FIRE ON THE

15:25 TABLE.

15:29 >> IN THIS MOMENT, THE ONLY THING THAT IS STANDING BETWEEN

15:32 THE PEOPLE OF THOUSAND AND THE CEASE FIRE IS HAMAS -- THE

15:40 PEOPLE OF GAZA AND THE CEASE-FIRE IS HAMAS.

15:47 THEY HAVE TO DECIDE.

16:26 JONATHAN: LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY, GOOD

16:27 MORNING. EQUITY FUTURES ON THE S&P 500

16:34 ARE DOWN BY .1%, DOWN ON THE MONTH BY 2.6% SO FAR ON THE S&P.

16:38 THE FACT THAT THAT IS THE BIGGEST MONTHLY LOSS IN

16:40 SEPTEMBER SHOWS HOW GOOD THINGS HAVE BEEN FOR THE EQUITY MARKET

16:42 OVER THE PREVIOUS FIVE MONTHS. YIELDS HIGHER UP TO 4.63.

16:50 CRUDE IS WELL BEHAVED, TO END IN THE LOW 80'S.

16:55 80 2.82 POSITIVE BY 0.2%. A CEASE-FIRE ON THE TABLE.

16:59 >> THE QUICKEST WAY TO BRING THIS TO AN END IS TO GET TO A

17:05 CEASE-FIRE AND THE RELEASE OF HOSTAGES.

17:11 HAMAS HAS PUT FORWARD A PROPOSAL THAT IS

17:15 EXTRAORDINARILY GENEROUS ON THE PART OF ISRAEL.

17:18 AT THIS MOMENT, THE ONLY THING STANDING BETWEEN THE PEOPLE OF

17:21 GAZA AND A CEASE-FIRE IS HAMAS. THEY HAVE TO DECIDE AND THEY

17:26 HAVE TO DECIDE QUICKLY. JONATHAN:

17:28 URGING HAMAS LEADERS TO RESPOND TO A PROPOSED TEMPORARY CEASE

17:35 FILE SEEING THE RELEASE OF ISRAELI HOSTAGES AND A DELAY OF

17:37 THE INVASION OF OFFER.

17:43 -- OF RAFA. GETTING YOUR PERSPECTIVE AS

17:46 ALWAYS. WE HAVE HEARD THIS STORY A FEW

17:50 TIMES AND IT HAS BEEN FALSE STORMS. DO YOU GET THE

17:52 IMPRESSION THAT THIS TIME IS DIFFERENT?

17:55 >> IT IS DIFFERENT. WE ARE APPROACHING AN

17:57 INFLECTION POINT. ISRAEL COMPLETED ITS FINAL

18:02 PREPARATIONS FOR AN OPERATION. THE ADMINISTRATION STATES THAT

18:08 ITS CONCERNS REGARDING HUMANITARIAN IMPACT OF THE

18:12 OPERATION HAVE NOT BEEN SQUASHED, BUT ISRAEL IS

18:15 REACHING A POINT WHERE IT DECIDE WHETHER TO GO OR NOT.

18:19 A DEAL IS MADE THAT INVOLVES A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT

18:23 CONCESSIONS. ISRAEL HAS LOWERED THE NUMBER

18:26 OF HOSTAGES IT IS SEEKING, INCREASED THE NUMBER OF

18:29 PALESTINIANS IT WILL RELEASE, AND A CEASE-FIRE THAT PROVIDES

18:33 HAMAS WITH A VICTORY OF SURVIVAL.THE NEXT FEW DAYS WILL

18:35 BE QUITE IMPORTANT. ANNMARIE: WHY WOULD HAMAS SAY NO TO THE

18:38 DEAL ON THE TABLE? NORMAN: THE DEAL IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE

18:43 IT ALLOWS SURVIVAL, BUT AT THE SAME TIME HAMAS HAS TO DECIDE

18:55 IN THE -- IN ITSELF, AS IT LOST THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE PRESSURE?

18:59 IF IT DECIDES IT FACES A LIFE-AND-DEATH MOMENT WITH AN

19:02 ISRAELI ATTACK IT WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO ACCEPT THE DEAL.

19:06 IF HAMAS BELIEVES FURTHER CONCESSIONS ARE LIKELY IT WILL

19:07 NOT APPROVE THIS OFFER. ANNMARIE:

19:11 IS A CEASE-FIRE A CEASE-FIRE? OR DOES IT JUST ME THAT IT IS

19:17 ON PAUSE IN TERMS OF THE RAW FOR -- IN TERMS OF THE ROTH

19:23 INVASION? NORMAN:

19:24 I THINK THAT THERE ARE THREE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES.

19:26 THE ENTIRE ISRAELI CABINET BELIEVES THAT IT IS IMPORTANT

19:31 TO ERADICATE THE HAMAS LEADERSHIP AND ABILITY TO BE

19:33 MILITARY FORCE.

19:40 EVEN FOR THOSE WHO SUPPORT THE CEASE-FIRE IN ISRAEL'S CAPITAL

19:43 ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING. THE UNITED STATES IS LOOKING

19:48 FOR A TEMPORARY DEAL TO EXTEND INTO A PERMANENT CEASE-FIRE.

19:53 HAMAS IS LOOKING FOR THE WITHDRAWAL OF ALL ISRAELI

19:55 FORCES FROM GAZA AND ITS RETURN TO POWER IN A PERMANENT

19:59 CEASE-FIRE ENVIRONMENT.THAT IS THE DANCE TAKING PLACE AT

20:01 PRESENT. LISA: YOU'RE AT THE WORLD ECONOMIC

20:03 FORUM SPECIAL MEETING IN RIYADH. THAT IS THE PLACE TO ANSWER THE

20:08 QUESTION I HAD WHILE I WAS READING REPORTS ABOUT WHO WILL

20:12 FILL THE VOID WHEN ISRAEL PULLS OUT IN THE CEASE-FIRE?

20:18 WILL IT BE QATAR, SAUDI ARABIA, THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES?

20:21 NORMAN: NONE OF THESE PARTNERS ARE

20:24 WILLING TO TAKE THE LEAD IN SUCH AN EFFORT.

20:29 IT IS NOT A GOOD THING TO HAVE PALESTINIANS SHOOTING AT

20:36 AEROBIC FORCES OR INTERNATIONAL FORCES.

20:37 THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOME SORT OF U.S.-LED PROCESS BY WHICH

20:39 THEY CAN PARTICIPATE IN SOME WAY TO ALLOW THE PALESTINIAN

20:42 AUTHORITY TO REASSERT ITSELF IN GAZA AND THE WEST

20:48 BANK.IT IS NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR THAT THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY

20:49 AUTHORITIES ARE PREPARED FOR THAT.

20:53 THE PALESTINIAN PRESIDENT SPOKE AT THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM.

20:56 HIS COMMENTS WERE -- LET'S SAY THAT THERE WAS NOT A LOT OF NEW

21:01 THERE AND NOT A LOT OF INDICATION THAT HE HAS THE

21:02 CAPACITY. A CONVERSATION AMONG DIPLOMATS

21:07 IN RIYADH HAVE BEEN INTENSIVE AND EXTENSIVE ON THE ISSUE.

21:10 LISA: YOU'RE SAYING IF THE CEASE-FIRE, TEMPORARY PAUSE,

21:14 WHATEVER YOU CALL IT IS EFFECTUATED THAT U.S.

21:16 TROOPS COULD BE ON THE GROUND KEEPING THE PEACE IN GAZA?

21:20 NORMAN: VERY UNLIKELY. U.S. FORCES ARE VERY UNLIKELY TO BE

21:25 INVOLVED IN ANY ON THE GROUND EFFORT.

21:28 THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN CONSISTENT IN THAT REGARD.

21:31 THE PROBLEM IS, NO OTHER ENTITY IS WILLING TO STEP IN.

21:35 THERE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSIONS OF AN INTERNATIONAL FORCE, BUT

21:39 THOSE DISCUSSIONS HAVEN'T GONE ANYWHERE.

21:41 THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND A CRITICAL ISSUE TO BE DECIDED.

21:45 ANNMARIE: ANYTIME YOU HAVE ANTONY BLINKEN

21:46 IN SAUDI ARABIA, EVERYONE STARTS WHISPERING ABOUT THE

21:49 IDEA OF NORMALIZATION. ARE WE ANY CLOSER TO THAT

21:52 BETWEEN RIYADH AND JERUSALEM? NORMAN:

21:57 NO, BUT WE ARE NO FURTHER AWAY EITHER.

22:00 THE SAUDIS HAVE MADE THEIR POSITION CLEAR LOOKING FOR A

22:06 FINITE, CLEAR, CONCRETE PATH TO PALESTINIAN STATEHOOD AND THAT

22:07 MUST BE WORKED OUT BY THE VARIOUS DIPLOMATS INVOLVED.

22:12 UNTIL THAT HAPPENS AND THEY SEE THAT THAT IS GOING TO OCCUR IN

22:15 A MANAGEABLE MANNER THEY ARE UNLIKELY TO AGREE TO

22:19 RESTORATION OR NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL. JONATHAN:

22:24 THANK YOU FOR MAKING TIME WITH US. I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE A BUSY

22:27 EVENING AHEAD OF YOU ARE THE FORMER SENIOR INTELLIGENCE

22:28 OFFICIAL. IN THE COMMODITY MARKET CRUDE

22:29 ON THE MONTH IS HIGHER BY 1.2%, WHICH IS MARGINAL RELATED TO

22:34 WHAT IS TAKING PLACE SO FAR THIS MONTH.

22:37 PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT THIS IS A NEW MIDDLE EAST. 'S HAVE BEEN

22:41 DRAWN AROUND THE CONFRONTATION AROUND ISRAEL AND IRAN.

22:46 HERE WE ARE WITH CRUDE HIGHER BY 1.2%.

22:54 LISA: THERE WAS THE SPECTER OF DIRECT

22:55 CONFRONTATION BETWEEN IRAN AND ISRAEL THAT WAS TAKEN OFF OF

22:57 THE TABLE AND MAYBE THE DE-ESCALATION GAY PEOPLE

23:00 CONFIDENCE WE WEREN'T GOING TO SEE TRUE OIL DISRUPTIONS.

23:03 WE ARE HIGHER ON THE FACT THAT INVENTORIES HAVE BEEN TAKEN

23:04 DOWN. THERE ARE FUNDAMENTAL REASONS

23:07 TO HAVE FEELING THAT WE COULD SEE HIGHER PRICES UNRELATED TO

23:09 WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE MIDDLE EAST. ANNMARIE:

23:12 PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO ERODE THE POLITICAL RISK THEY PUT

23:17 INTO THE PRICE AND GLOBAL SURPRISE HAVE NOT BEEN

23:19 HIT.THERE HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MISSILES

23:21 FLOWN BACK AND FORTH, BUT ACTUAL SUPPLIES HAVE NOT BEEN

23:25 HIT. UNTIL THAT HAPPENS WE WON'T SEE

23:27 THIS MARKET TAKEOFF. JONATHAN: YOU CAN SEE THE RELUCTANCE OF

23:30 THIS ADMINISTRATION TO DO ANYTHING THAT DISRUPTS GLOBAL

23:33 SUPPLY. EQUITIES IF YOU ARE TUNING IN,

23:36 WELCOME, EQUITY FUTURES DOWN BY JUST 1/10 OF 1%.

23:41 PLENTY TO TARGET ABOUT -- PLENTY TO TALK ABOUT IN THE FX

23:43 MARKET. THE BOJ ACCOUNTS POINT TO WHAT

23:51 THEY CALL THE YENTERVENTION.

23:57 LISA: DO YOU THINK THAT YOU COULD USE

23:58 IT FOR OTHER THINGS TOO? JONATHAN: WHAT LIKE?

24:04 LISA: YOU'RE GOING TO BRING THAT INTO

24:09 THE CONVERSATION, DOING ANOTHER YENTERVENTION? JONATHAN:

24:12 I GUESS IT DOESN'T WORK, DOES IT. MOST SIGNS POINT TO YEN

24:16 INTERVENTION. LISA: I KILLED IT FOR YOU? JONATHAN:

24:21 I THINK IT DIED. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. ♪

24:43 JONATHAN: THE MONTH OF MAY IS AROUND THE

24:49 CORNER, CLOSING OUT APRIL WITH -2% ON THE S&P ENDED SIMILAR

24:55 MOVE DOWN ON THE S&P. AMAZON LATER THIS AFTERNOON,

25:01 APPLE ON THURSDAY, YOU'LL GET 10% OF THE INDEX REPORTING

25:03 EARNINGS ACROSS TWO NAMES. THE EQUITY MARKET.

25:05 THE BOND MARKET LOOKS LIKE THIS. THE FIRST DAY OF THE FED'S

25:10 TWO-DAY POLICY MEETING COMMENCES, CONCLUDES TOMORROW

25:13 AFTERNOON. THE YIELDS ARE HIGHER BY ALMOST

25:15 A BASIS POINT. 4.9830. LISA:

25:21 IT IS A LONG-TERM TRAJECTORY THAT I FIND THE MOST

25:24 INTERESTING ABOUT THE NARRATIVE SHIFT IN APRIL.

25:25 PEOPLE ARE TALKING BOUT THAT MAY BE RATES AREN'T RESTRICTIVE

25:28 AND COULD STAY AROUND FOR LONGER TIME.

25:32 IF THE FEDERAL RESERVE INDICATES THAT ANYWAY, IF THERE

25:36 POPPED THE QUESTION AND INDICATE THE WRONG ANSWER, HOW

25:38 BIG OF A SELLOFF COULD WE GET IT PEOPLE HAVE TRULY COME

25:41 AROUND TO THE IDEA THE EARNINGS ARE RESILIENT ENOUGH TO KEEP

25:43 THIS GOING WITH RATES WHERE THEY ARE? JONATHAN:

25:46 GIVEN THAT CHAIR POWELL KNOWS WHAT QUESTION IS COMING, DOES

25:49 HE FUMBLE IT OR NOT? LISA: IN THE PAST I WOULD HAVE SAID

25:54 NO WAY, BUT IN THE PAST HE HAS FUMBLED IT. I WILL NOT WEIGH IN.

25:59 ANNMARIE: HE NEEDS TO PRACTICE. JONATHAN:

26:03 LET'S TALK ABOUT THE EURO.

26:09 POSITED BY 0.1%. UNDER SURVEILLANCE THIS

26:15 MORNING, THE EURO ZONE EXITS RECESSION WITH BETTER THAN

26:16 EXPECTED GDP DATA TO START THE YEAR END CONSUMER PRICES RISING

26:18 2.4% YEAR-OVER-YEAR. AND IMPROVING GERMANY AS IT

26:23 FACES A TROUBLED INDUSTRIAL SECTOR.

26:26 THE TROUBLES PERSIST, BUT RELATIVE TO EXPECTATIONS

26:28 SURPRISES IN GERMANY, FRANCE, ITALY, AND SPAIN, THE RIGHT

26:31 KIND OF SURPRISES THIS TIME AROUND. LISA:

26:34 YOU PUT IT WELL WHEN YOU SAID, IS THIS THE U.S.

26:39 BECOMING LESS EXCEPTIONAL? IS THIS A BROADENING OUT WHERE

26:43 GROWTH IS COMING IN BETTER THAN EXPECTED BUT INFLATION IS

26:44 STICKIER THAN EXPECTED. THE EURO DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO

26:47 MAKE OF IT AND NEITHER DO WE. IT IS A QUESTION OF, IS THIS

26:51 NOT JUST A U.S. STORY? JONATHAN: THE EURO HAS BEEN DAZED FOR

26:55 MONTHS NOW.

27:01 THE WORLD COMING DOWN TO THE U.S. OR THE U.S.

27:05 COMING DOWN TO THE WORLD. ANNMARIE:

27:10 BETTER WHEN YOU LOOK AT CHINA AND EUROPE.

27:13 CHINA, YOU DO SEE EMPHASIS ON EXPORTS, WHICH MAKES YOU THINK,

27:17 WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THE DOMESTIC FRONT?

27:19 WHERE IS THE DOMESTIC DEMAND? AN IMF OFFICIAL SAID IT IS NOT

27:23 OVERCAPACITY. THEY DO NEED TO DO MORE WHEN IT

27:28 COMES TO THEIR DOMESTIC DEMAND. JONATHAN:

27:33 THE AMERICANS HAVE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON THAT ISSUE.

27:35 THE EURO, CARMAKERS, NOTHING GOOD ABOUT IT AT ALL.

27:37 HEADWINDS FOR EV'S. ALL REPORTING DISAPPOINTING

27:41 SALES. ELON MUSK IS PLANNING HUNDREDS

27:47 MORE JOB CUTS WITH TWO MORE SENIOR EXECUTIVES SET TO LEAVE

27:49 TESLA. THAT STOCK IS DOWN BY 2%. THE MERCEDES FIRST-QUARTER

27:55 EARNINGS DOWN BY ONE THIRD. VOLKSWAGEN DOWN BY 20%. LISA:

27:58 ELECTRIC VEHICLE DEMAND IS DOWN ACROSS THE BOARD, EVEN IN

28:00 EUROPE. THE IDEA WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

28:07 CHINA, OVERCAPACITY, THE IMF SAYING NO, THIS BE THE FIRST

28:09 TIME PRESIDENT XI WILL BE COMING TO EUROPE.

28:12 WHERE IS HE GOING MAY 5? FRANCE, SERBIA, HUNGARY.

28:19 BUY OUR CARS. THIS HAS BEEN AN AREA LESS

28:22 IMMUNE TO THE EXPORTS FROM CHINA AT CHEAPER PRICE POINTS.

28:27 WILL THEY GET SOME DIVISION BETWEEN THE U.S. AND EUROPE?

28:32 OR WILL THIS BE FOCUSED ON THE EU.

28:35 ANNMARIE: CHINA, EUROPE, THE U.S.

28:36 ARE WHERE SALES ARE WHEN IT COMES TO EV'S SO CHINA AND

28:40 EUROPE NEED TO START BUYING MORE FOR THE CAR COMPANIES BE

28:44 DOING BETTER AND YOU CAN SEE THAT ACROSS THE BOARD IN THE

28:48 OIL SECTOR. JONATHAN: AN ATTEMPT TO OPEN MORE

28:50 FACTORIES AND GET THE BRAND -- ARE PEOPLE GOING TO BUY THE

28:52 BRAND IN PLACES LIKE AMERICA? BYD, IS THAT GOING TO TAKE OFF?

28:59 EVEN IF THEY ARE REALLY CHEAP, IS THAT GOING TO TAKE OFF?

29:03 LISA: NOT IN THE U.S., BUT MAY BE

29:06 FRANCE, SERBIA, AND HUNGRY AND THAT IS WHY XI JINPING IS OVER

29:07 THERE. ANNMARIE:

29:13 IN ITALY THEY ARE POTENTIALLY LOOKING UP OPENING A PLANT BUT

29:16 THEY DITCHED BELT AND ROAD. THE IPHONES, THE LUXURY APPEAL

29:21 OF BRAND, SIMILAR WITH BYD. IT IS NOT THE SAME IN WESTERN

29:24 MINDS AS A TESLA. JONATHAN: MAY 5, THE CHINESE LEADER

29:28 HEADING TO EUROPE. SECRETARY OF STATE ANTONY

29:33 BLINKEN CONTINUING HIS TRIP IN THE MIDDLE EAST MAKING STOPS IN

29:36 JORDAN AND ISRAEL URGING LEADERS OF HAMAS TO ACCEPT THE

29:40 DEAL TO RELEASE ISRAELI HOSTAGES AND DELAY AN INVASION

29:43 OF RAFAH. THIS IS HIS SEVENTH TRIP TO THE

29:50 REGION SINCE LAST OCTOBER. THERE IS A SENSE THAT THIS TIME

29:51 I BE CLOSER TO A DEAL? ANNMARIE: SECRETARY BLINKEN SAID THAT

29:56 THIS IS THE MOST GENEROUS DEAL THAT ISRAEL IS PUTTING ON THE

29:59 TABLE.I WAS TALKING TO A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS FROM THE REGION AND

30:04 YOU HAVE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE UNITED STATES, CUTTER, AND

30:06 ISRAEL IN CAIRO TODAY. YESTERDAY THE PRESIDENT GOT ON

30:11 THE PHONE. A LOT OF PRESSURE FROM THE

30:16 UNITED STATES ALL OF THESE COUNTRIES TO ACCEPT THIS DEAL.

30:20 JONATHAN: LET'S TURN BACK TO FOREIGN

30:23 EXCHANGE AND THE YEN FALLING AGAINST THE DOLLAR FOLLOWING

30:26 NEW ACCOUNTS FROM THE BOJ INDICATING THAT IT LIKELY

30:28 INTERVENED ON THE CURRENCY YESTERDAY.

30:33 JOINING US, IS IT EFFICIENT EVEN IF THEY DID INTERVENE IN

30:35 THIS AFFECTS MARKET?

30:41 >> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. I ALWAYS ENJOY COMING ON YOUR

30:43 SHOW. MY SHORT ANSWER WOULD BE, NO.

30:48 I CAN'T GO BACK TO MONETARY POLICY DIVERGENT SINCE AND THAT

30:52 HAS BEEN DRIVING DOLLAR-YEN HIGHER ESPECIALLY WITH THE

30:58 LATEST ROUND OF FED HAWKISHNESS COUPLED WITH THE BANK OF JAPAN.

31:02 THE MARKET DID NOT DISAPPOINT. I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT THE BANK

31:08 OF JAPAN DID NOT THINK THIS OUT OR DOESN'T APPEAR TO HAVE

31:15 THOUGHT THIS OUT CLEARLY.

31:17 HOW THE WEAK YEN WASN'T IMPACTING INFLATION

31:19 YET. UNTIL SOMETHING HAPPENS ON THE

31:21 FED SIDE, IT GETS MORE DOVISH AND CUTS RATES, OR ON THE JAPAN

31:26 SIDE, THERE STUCK AND MORE HAWKISH HIKE RATES, I CAN ONLY

31:28 SEE DOLLAR-YEN GOING HIGHER. JONATHAN:

31:33 CRISIS, CURRENCY CRISIS, WHAT WOULD A CRISIS LOOK LIKE AND

31:36 YOU THINK WE HAVE THE INGREDIENTS FOR ONE? WIN:

31:39 SHORT ANSWER, NO.

31:45 I THINK -- MARKETS ARE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR THE NEXT SHOE TO

31:46 DROP.

31:48 STRONG DOLLAR IS A PROBLEM FOR MANY COUNTRIES BUT ISN'T A

31:54 CRISIS. IF WE START TO GET DISLOCATIONS

31:58 IN OTHER MARKETS, THE U.S. TREASURY MARKETS, SOMETHING

32:04 WIDER THAN THE EXCHANGE RATE WE COULD START TALKING ABOUT

32:06 CRISIS, BUT I DON'T SEE THE SEEDS.

32:10 IT IS A STRONG DOLLAR ISSUE. IT ISN'T JUST JAPAN.

32:13 KOREA IS COMPLAINING.

32:22 I DON'T SEE ANYTHING LIKE A TYPO RECORD EMERGING SOON.

32:29 THE MOVEMENTS HAVEN'T BEEN THAT LARGE OR DISRUPTIVE YET.

32:35 BUT IT IS WORTH KEEPING AN EYE ON.

32:36 LISA: THE IDEA $40 BILLION, $45 BILLION OF YEN INTERVENTION IS

32:38 IT SIGNIFICANT IN THE SCHEME OF THINGS BUT THE IDEA OF HIKING

32:40 RATES IS MORE SIGNIFICANT. DOES THIS PUT THIS BACK ON THE

32:42 TABLE FOR THE BANK OF JAPAN IN A MORE MATERIAL WAY? WIN:

32:48 THEY DID SUCH A DOVISH FOLD LAST WEEK THAT I WAS SHOCKED.

32:50 THE CURRENCY MARKETS WERE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE

32:51 HAWKISH. FIRST, THE NEXT STEP WOULD BE

32:57 MORE HAWKISH FORWARD GUIDANCE. THE MARKETS ONLY PRICED IN 50

33:00 OR 60 BASIS POINTS OF TIGHTENING OVER TWO YEARS WHICH

33:02 IS VERY SHALLOW. THE BANK OF JAPAN'S GUIDANCE

33:07 HASN'T HELPED.

33:14 OVERNIGHT, WE HAD SOFT DATA FOR MARCH THAT UNDERSCORES THE BANK

33:16 OF JAPAN IS BEING CAUTIOUS. YOU CAN'T HAVE YOUR CAKE AND

33:19 EAT IT TOO. IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOVISH

33:21 SHE WILL HAVE A WEAK CURRENCY. IF YOU WANT TO REALLY PUT A

33:25 FLOOR UNDER YOUR CURRENCY YOU WILL HAVE TO HIKE RATES.

33:29 AT THIS POINT, I THINK THAT THE BANK OF JAPAN IS GUN SHY.

33:34 LAST TIME THAT THEY TRY TO HIKE RATES JAPAN FELL BACK INTO A

33:37 RECESSION, SO I UNDERSTAND WHY THEY HAVE BEEN SO CAUTIOUS.

33:39 THERE ARE SO MANY MOVING PARTS I DON'T KNOW IF THIS POLICY

33:42 PATH HAS BEEN WELL THOUGHT OUT. LISA:

33:46 A REAL QUESTION WE HAVE BEEN ASKING ALL MORNING IS THE IDEA

33:52 OF, IS THIS BASICALLY THE U.S. EXCEPTIONALISM RUNNING OUT OF

33:54 BEING EXCEPTIONAL AND THE REST OF THE WORLD COMING TO THE SAME

33:57 PLACE WHERE GROWTH IS STRONGER AND INFLATION IS STICKIER?

34:01 THAT MEANS HIGHER RATES GLOBALLY WHERE CENTRAL BANKS

34:03 CANNOT LOWER RATES NEARLY AS MUCH AS MANY PEOPLE

34:07 EXPECTED? IS THAT BASICALLY WHAT YOU ARE

34:10 LOOKING AT IN THIS MISHMASH OF FOREIGN CURRENCY MOVES THAT

34:11 HAVE LEFT US SCRATCHING OUR HEADS? WIN: THE PROBLEM WITH

34:15 FOREIGN-EXCHANGE IS IT IS NOT AN ABSOLUTE STORY IT IS A

34:18 RELATIVE STORY. U.S.

34:24 EXCEPTIONALISM IS ABSOLUTE IN THE SENSE THAT GROWTH IS

34:25 MULTIPLES OF WHAT WE ARE SEEING IN EUROPE OR ELSEWHERE.

34:31 I WOULD SAY THAT ONE THING I DID GET WRONG IN THE LAST CYCLE

34:33 IS I THINK THAT THE U.K. AND EUROPE, I THOUGHT THAT THEY

34:37 WOULD BE IN A MUCH DEEPER RECESSION.

34:40 WE ARE SEEING THE EUROPEAN DATA THAT WAS QUITE SHALLOW.

34:44 WHEN I STEPPED BACK IT IS HARD FOR ME TO GET EXCITED ABOUT

34:45 EUROPE. A LOT OF HEADWINDS.

34:54 EUROPE IS MORE DEPENDENT ON CHINA. WE ARE NEGATIVE ON CHINA

34:55 DESPITE SOME SIGNS OF LIFE IN THE ECONOMY.

34:59 WE ARE NOT QUITE AS EXCEPTIONAL AS WE WERE IN THE U.S.

35:03 BUT REMAIN LIKING THE DOLLAR HIGHER.

35:07 I THINK THE FED WILL DELIVER A HAWKISH MESSAGE TOMORROW.

35:11 YOU WERE JOKING EARLIER ABOUT IF MR. POWELL CAN STICK TO

35:16 SCRIPT. I THINK YOU WILL HAVE WRITTEN

35:18 ON HIS HAND, "DON'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT CUTS." [LAUGHTER]

35:22 BUT ALWAYS LOOKING FOR SOME KIND OF DOVISH SLIP.

35:29 I THINK IF HE WANTS TO DO AN INSURANCE CUT OR TWO THIS YEAR

35:31 THE DATA WON'T ALLOW HIM. IT IS A WAITING GAME TO SEE HOW

35:34 THE ECONOMY EVOLVES. JONATHAN: YOU SAID HE WILL BE HAWKISH

35:38 TOMORROW. WHAT YOU THINK YOU WILL SAY?

35:41 WIN: I DON'T THINK THAT HE IS GOING

35:44 TO SAY THE H-WORD. HIKE ISN'T AND HIS VOCABULARY

35:48 AT THIS POINT. HE WAS A RATE CUTS WILL

35:51 CONTINUE TO BE PUSHED OUT. EARLIER HE SAID WE WILL CUT

35:56 SOMETIME THIS YEAR, SOMETIME THIS YEAR, COMING SOON.

35:58 BUT HE CAN'T SAY THAT. HE WILL SAY THE DATA ARE NOT

36:04 ALLOWING FOR A CUT RIGHT NOW. WE DON'T HAVE CONFIDENCE

36:07 INFLATION IS GOING TO THE 2% TARGET RELATIVELY SOON.

36:11 THESE ARE THINGS THAT FED OFFICIALS TALKED ABOUT BEFORE

36:13 THE BLACKOUT PERIOD. I SEE A CONTINUATION OF THAT.

36:17 NOTHING IS HAPPENED SINCE THE BLACKOUT PERIOD BEGAN THAT

36:21 MAKES HIM HAVE TO CHANGE THE SCRIPT.

36:26 250 THOUSAND PLUS JOBS THIS FRIDAY, INFLATION REMAINS

36:28 STICKY AND HIGHER. IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR

36:33 THE FED TO DELIVER ANYTHING SHORT OF A HAWKISH MESSAGE

36:36 TOMORROW. JONATHAN: YOU'RE BASICALLY DESCRIBING A

36:41 GUY WHO WILL SIT THERE WITH ONE HAND, DON'T CUT, DON'T SAY IT.

36:47 ON THE OTHER HAND, DON'T SAY HIKE EITHER. THIS WILL BE FUN.

36:50 LOOKING AHEAD TO THE FED TOMORROW AFTERNOON. LISA:

36:53 THIS FEELS LIKE KINDERGARTEN.

37:02 THE H-WORD, THE T-WORD, JUST SIT THERE LIKE A DEER IN

37:06 HEADLIGHTS AND SAY, HI, WE ARE THE FED. JONATHAN:

37:14 LISA IT WILL -- IT WILL BE ONE OF THOSE NEWS CONFERENCES WHERE

37:15 YOU REACH FOR THE NOTES. LISA: DOESN'T HE WANT THE SELLOFF, TO

37:21 PROLONG THE SELLOFF TO GET INFLATION TO A PLACE WHERE THEY

37:23 CAN DO THE CUTS THEY ARE LOOKING FOR?

37:26 IF HE IS WILLING TO DO THAT, WHY NOT SAY THE H-WORD.

37:31 JONATHAN: IF YOU SAID THAT IT AUGUST OF

37:34 2022I WOULD SAY THAT IS WHAT HE WANTS. ASKING WHERE FINANCIAL

37:38 CONDITIONS ARE IF THEY ARE LOOSE OR TIGHT.

37:40 I AM TELLING YOU HE THINKS THAT THEY ARE EFFICIENTLY

37:44 RESTRICTIVE. LISA: JOHN WILLIAMS WENT THERE AND

37:46 JOHN WILLIAMS IS DOVISH. HE SAID THE H WORD.

37:51 I WONDER IF THAT PAVES THE WAY FOR THAT TO BE WASHED OFF OF

37:56 HIS LEFT PALM? JONATHAN:

37:58 BENJAMIN NETANYAHU SAYING THAT WE WILL NOT STOP THE WAR BEFORE

38:03 ACHIEVING ALL OF ITS GOALS AMONG THE BACKDROP OF

38:07 ISRAEL-HAMAS AND EXPERT SUGGESTING WE COULD BE CLOSE TO

38:09 SOME KIND OF CEASE FIRE. GOING ON TO SAY, WE WILL

38:17 ELIMINATE HAM -- HAMAS BATTALIONS. ANNMARIE:

38:22 EVEN IF THEY GET A DEAL ON THE TABLE BENJAMIN NETANYAHU IS

38:25 DETERMINED TO MAKE SURE EVERY LAST BASTIAN OF THE HAMAS HOLD

38:27 IS ERADICATED. THESE KINDS OF COMMENTS AS THEY

38:32 ARE SITTING DOWN IN CAIRO, REPRESENTATIVES, IT COULD MEAN

38:36 THAT THE DEAL WOULD BE OFF. IF CEASE FIRE IS A CEASE-FIRE,

38:40 BUT UNTIL WHAT POINT? DOES THIS MEAN SIX MONTHS AND

38:44 POTENTIAL ISRAEL RECALIBRATE SANTA GOES IN?

38:45 WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE. JONATHAN:

38:49 THE OBJECTIVES HAVEN'T CHANGED ACCORDING TO THE PRIME

38:50 MINISTER'S OFFICE. LET'S GET YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF.

38:55 DANI: ELON MUSK'S WEALTH IS ONCE AGAIN CLIMBING THE RICH LIST.

39:00 MUSKA GAINED MORE THAN 37 BILLION DOLLARS IN NET WORTH

39:03 OVER THE NEXT FIVE DAYS ACCORDING TO THE BLOOMBERG

39:05 BILLIONAIRES INDEX. OFF OF THE BACK OF NEWS THAT HE

39:10 GAINED SUPPORT FOR HIS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IN CHINA,

39:14 MUSK ADDED $18.5 BILLION TO HIS FORTUNE YESTERDAY AND NOW HAS A

39:16 NET WORTH OF MORE THAN $201 BILLION AND IS CLOSE TO

39:20 OVERTAKING SECOND PLACE, JEFF BEZOS.

39:24 WE ARE TALKING ABOUT RETURNING TO OFFICE.

39:26 MACY'S HAS ISSUED A MANDATE TO CORPORATE EMPLOYEES, GET BACK

39:30 TO THE OFFICE OR FACE DISCIPLINARY ACTION.

39:32 THE COMPANY INFORMED HYBRID EMPLOYEES THAT THEY WILL NEED

39:34 TO BE IN THE OFFICE FOR TWO DAYS A WEEK STARTING MAY 13.

39:39 THAT IS ACCORDING TO PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH THE MATTER.

39:42 MACY'S IS GIVING EMPLOYEES A THREE-MONTH GRACE TIME TO MOVE

39:45 BACK TO THE NEW YORK CITY AREA AND IF THEY HAVEN'T RETURNED

39:48 WORKERS WILL RISK CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING TERMINATION.

39:53 ROKU PRICES PLUNGING BY THE MOST EVER.

39:57 THEY SURGED MORE THAN 100% THIS YEAR ALONE BUT THE PRICE SWINGS

40:02 ARE BECOMING MORE EXTREME AND FEWER COMPANIES CAN MAINTAIN

40:04 TRADING POSITIONS AS THE SUPPLY DEFICIT MADE COCO MORE

40:08 EXPENSIVE THAN COPPER THIS YEAR AND LIQUIDITY HAS DRAINED FROM

40:09 THE MARKET. JONATHAN: THANK YOU. GOING INTO MEMORIAL DAY

40:21 WEEKEND. NEXT, THE FED'S FIRST CUT.

40:29 >> AS THE LABOR MARKET GETS INTO BETTER BALANCE THAT SHOULD

40:32 SLOW THE RATE OF WAGE GROWTH BRINGING BACK DOWN THE SUPER

40:36 CORE RATE OF INFLATION. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR

40:39 IN TERMS OF THE FED EASING LATER THIS YEAR. JONATHAN:

40:43 THAT CONVERSATION IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER.

40:44 LIVE FROM NEW YORK, THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

40:59 JONATHAN: EQUITY FUTURES ON THE S&P 500

41:04 ARE PULLING BACK BY .1%, NO DRAMA IN THE EQUITY MARKET THIS

41:07 TUESDAY MORNING WITH YIELDS HIGHER BY SINGLE BASIS POINT ON

41:09 THE 10-YEAR. THE EURO ADVANCING GDP A LITTLE

41:13 BETTER ACROSS THE TOP FOUR EUROZONE GDP ECONOMIES:

41:19 FRANCE, GERMANY, ITALY, AND SPAIN.

41:22 ALL DOING BETTER THAN EXPECTED. UNDER SURVEILLANCE THIS

41:25 MORNING, SLIM ODDS FOR THE FED'S FIRST CUT.

41:29 >> THE LABOR MARKET IS GETTING INTO BETTER BALANCE IN TERMS OF

41:31 SUPPLY AND DEMAND. AS THE LABOR MARKET GETS INTO

41:35 BETTER BALANCE THAT SHOULD SLOW THE RATE OF WAGE GROWTH, AND

41:39 THAT BRINGS BACK DOWN THE SUPER CORE RATE OF INFLATION.

41:42 THAT IS WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR IN TERMS OF THE FED EASING

41:45 LATER THIS YEAR. JONATHAN: THE FED'S TWO DAY MEETING IS

41:48 KICKING OFF WITH THE CENTRAL BANK WIDELY EXPECTED TO HOLD

41:51 RATES STEADY. A STRING OF HOT INFLATION

41:55 TRENDS AND LABOR MARKET SETTING THE STAGE FOR JAY POWELL TO

41:57 MAKE A HAWKISH PRIVATE. "THE STRONGER ECONOMY DOES NOT

42:03 COMPLICATE THE FED'S FIGHT AGAINST INFLATION, NOR IS IT A

42:07 REASON FOR THE BANK TO DELAY RATE CUTS, NOTWITHSTANDING

42:11 2024'S BUMPY START ON INFLATION. THERE'S REASON TO BELIEVE THE

42:14 TRADE-OFF IS WEAKER NOW THAN IN THE PAST." LET'S GO TO THE

42:19 FINAL POINT FIRST. I WOULD LOVE TO GET THOUGHTS ON THAT.

42:22 WHAT FORCES ARE CHANGING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DEMAND AND

42:23 INFLATION?

42:28 >> FIRST AND FOREMOST, THE PANDEMIC CAME THROUGH THE

42:30 ECONOMY AND DISRUPTED US IN WAYS WE HAVEN'T SEEN IN LIVING

42:33 MEMORY. THIS IS FUNDAMENTALLY A DIFFERENT TYPE OF TWIST AND

42:39 TURN , THE ABILITY OF THE ECONOMY TO PRODUCE.

42:43 ONE THING WE UNWOUND LAST YEAR WAS THAT WE HAD A NOTABLE LABOR

42:45 SHORTAGE. PEOPLE LEFT AT THE BEGINNING OF

42:47 THE PANDEMIC. LAST YEAR WE BROUGHT A LOT OF

42:50 WORKERS BACK. THAT IS A BIG REASON WHY THE

42:52 U.S. ECONOMY COULD GROW AND NOT PUSH

42:55 INFLATION OF MORE. WE COULD MEET THAT DEMAND.

43:02 THAT IS NOT -- WHEN YOU HAVE SUPPLY DISRUPTIONS YOU HAVE THE

43:04 OPPORTUNITY TO FIX THEM. WE LARGELY DID THAT WITH THE

43:07 LABOR MARKET LAST YEAR. YOU CAN GET THESE TWO PIECES

43:10 TOGETHER. IT'S UNUSUAL. USUALLY DEMAND IS OUT OF

43:15 CONTROL AND IT IS HARD TO GET SUPPLY.

43:17 THIS TIME WE FIXED THINGS ON THE SUPPLY SIDE. JONATHAN:

43:21 IT IS IMPRESSIVE TO SEE HOW THAT PLAYED OUT IN THE LAST 12

43:22 MONTHS. CAN WE FOCUS ON THE LAST THREE

43:25 OR FOUR? THE FED FOCUSED ON THE UPSIDE

43:29 SURPRISES AT THE START OF 2024 INITIALLY DESCRIBING THEM AS

43:32 BUMPS IN THE ROAD AND ARE NOW STARTING TO SOUND CONCERNED.

43:36 WHY SHOULDN'T THEY BE CONCERNED BY THESE POSITIVE, SO-CALLED

43:38 UPSIDE SURPRISES OF THE YEAR SO FAR? CLAUDIA:

43:42 THEY SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT EVERYTHING.

43:43 WE ARE STARING AT EVERY MONTH OF INFLATION DATA THAT COMES

43:45 OUT. WE LEARNED LAST WEEK THAT JANUARY WAS A MESS IN TERMS OF

43:52 INFLATION PICKING UP. WE DIDN'T SEE THE PATH BACK TO

43:59 A REAL DISINFLATION IN MARCH. I THINK THAT WAS THE

44:00 DISAPPOINTMENT. THAT WAS ONE THAT POWELL

44:04 RELEASED SEEMED TO THINK THAT WE WOULD GET BACK ON TRACK IN

44:05 MARCH AND WE DIDN'T. I GET IT, BUT THERE ARE A LOT

44:13 OF PIECES THAT ARE LEFT IN INFLATION, LIKE THE OWNERS OF

44:15 EQUIVALENT RENT, THE VEHICLE SERVICES, THE VEHICLE INSURANCE.

44:20 WHAT LEVEL OF INTEREST RATES DO YOU NEED TO GET THOSE DOWN IN A

44:21 SUSTAINABLE WAY? THEY'RE VERY COMPLICATED.

44:24 THEY HAVE THE SUPPLY ASPECT. THEY ARE VERY BACKWARD LOOKING.

44:30 JONATHAN: WHAT IS THE UPSIDE OF FED CHAIR

44:36 POWELL SAYING THE SEA-WORD -- C-WORD?

44:39 IS HE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE T-WORD, TRANSITORY?

44:43 IF HE TALKS ABOUT CUTS, WHAT IS THE BENEFIT TO HIM?

44:48 CLAUDIA: THERE IS NONE. IF YOU OPEN TO SMELL THERE IS

44:49 ALL DOWNSIDE RISK. WE ALL WANT CERTAINTY.

44:54 WE LOOK TO THE FED AS SOME ORACLE, WHICH WE SHOULD NOT.

45:00 THUS WHAT COMES OUT OF POWELL'S MOUTH PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR WHAT

45:07 THEY WANT TO HEAR, AND OFTEN RUNNING THEY GO.

45:09 POWELL WILL ASPIRE TO BE THE MOST BORING HE POSSIBLY CAN

45:11 TOMORROW. I CAN'T IMAGINE THE FED WANTS

45:13 TO MOVE THE MARKET OUT LESS THAN TWO CUTS.

45:17 THE SEPTEMBER MEETING WHERE THAT COULD GET STARTED WITH

45:25 TWO, THEY HAVE FIVE MORE CPI PRINTS. THAT COULD BE FOREVER.

45:26 WE COULD BE BACK INTO THE WHY HAVEN'T THEY CUT YET DISCUSSION.

45:31 THINGS COULD MOVE FAST. WHAT REASON DOES HE HAVE TO RESET

45:36 EXPECTATIONS?

45:37 TAKE A BREATH. THIS WAS DISAPPOINTING.

45:39 WE DON'T KNOW WHAT COMES NEXT.HE WILL EMPHASIZE

45:40 DATA-DRIVEN . LISA:

45:46 STAY TUNED TOMORROW. TOMORROW WE WILL COVER JAY

45:50 POWELL AS HE ATTEMPTS TO BE THE MOST BORING GUY IN THE HISTORY

45:51 OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE. I'M CURIOUS AS YOU TALK ABOUT

45:55 THE IDEA OF THE FED BEING IN A BAD SPOT EITHER WAY.

45:59 THEY DO HAVE SOME COMMUNICATION THAT ACTS AS MONETARY POLICY.

46:05 THERE IS A THEORY THAT IF THERE WAS MORE OF A PROTRACTED

46:08 SELLOFF IN EQUITY MARKETS AND RISK MARKETS, THAT COULD HELP

46:11 THE FED GET TO THEIR GOAL OF LOWER INFLATION.

46:13 WHY DO YOU DISAGREE WITH THAT? CLAUDIA:

46:17 THE FED HAS REALLY STRUGGLED. THIS MAKES SENSE.

46:22 THEY HAVE STRUGGLED TO FIND TUNE FORWARD GUIDANCE.

46:26 IT'S HARD TO PREDICT WHAT THE MARKETS ARE GOING TO DO, WHAT

46:29 THEY ARE GOING TO GO OFF AND RUNNING ABOUT.

46:34 POWELL HAS LOOKED AT THIS ECONOMY AND SAID THAT INTEREST

46:38 RATES ARE RESTRICTIVE.WE ARE PUTTING DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON

46:41 THE ECONOMY AND YOU CAN SEE IT

46:44 IN SOME INTEREST RATE SECTORS. DO WE WANT TO BE 25 BASIS

46:45 POINTS HIGHER OR 50? YOU ARE WADING INTO TERRITORY

46:50 WHERE IT CAN GET AWAY FROM YOU. I THINK THAT HE WILL REPEAT

46:56 THAT WE ARE IN A RESTRICTIVE TERRITORY AND THERE ARE READY

46:58 TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET INFLATION DOWN. LISA:

47:02 WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SEEING THE BITING OF THE HIGHER

47:05 RATES, WE ARE SEEING IT FROM THE HIGHEST COMPANIES REPORTING

47:09 EARNINGS DELIVERING ENOUGH OF A POSITIVE SURPRISE THAT PEOPLE

47:11 ARE ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE PROSPECTS FOR CORPORATE AMERICA.

47:17 YOU THINK THE FED SHOULD ERR ON THE SIDE OF PROTECTING SMALL

47:19 BUSINESSES AND A HOST OF CONSUMERS THAT ARE MORE

47:21 AFFECTED DISPROPORTIONATELY BY HIGHER RATES AT THE EXPENSE OF

47:23 A HIGHER LONG-TERM INFLATION RATE IN THE UNITED STATES?

47:27 CLAUDIA: THE FED'S MANDATE IS FOR THE

47:28 COUNTRY AS A WHOLE. THEY ARE NOT SET UP TO PINPOINT

47:34 CERTAIN GROUPS OF CONSUMERS OR BUSINESSES AND SAY THAT WE WILL

47:36 GIVE YOU RELIEF ON INTEREST RATES.

47:38 THEY ARE FOCUSED ON GETTING INFLATION DOWN.

47:40 WE DON'T NEED TO TURN THE CRANKS THAT MUCH.

47:46 WE ARE WITHIN LESS THAN A PERCENTAGE POINT OF THEIR GOAL.

47:53 WE ARE NOT AT 5% OF CORE INFLATION, CORE PCE INFLATION,

47:56 LIKE WE WERE BEFORE THE DISINFLATION STARTED.

47:59 WE DON'T NEED TO GET TOO WORKED UP ABOUT THREE MONTHS OF DATA.

48:03 YET, TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY. IF IT GETS STALLED OUT THIS IS

48:07 A PROBLEM AND THE FED WILL ADJUST COURSE.

48:13 IT IS JUST SWINGING AROUND THIS MUCH EXPECTATIONS IN MARKETS

48:20 FEELS OVERDONE. JONATHAN: APPRECIATE YOUR INSIGHT.

48:24 ON THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND CHAIRMAN POWELL, IF HE OPENS

48:25 HIS MOUTH THERE IS DOWNSIDE RISK.

48:31 DATE ONE OF THE TWO DAY MEETING OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE, TUNE IN

48:33 AT 2:00 P.M. EASTERN TOMORROW FOR -- LISA:

48:36 THE MOST BORING GUY. JONATHAN: I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE

48:41 POLITICAL CALENDAR. BNP PARIBAS SAYING THAT

48:43 DELAYING THE START OF THE CUTTING CYCLE UNTIL JULY, IF

48:49 YOU CAN CALL IT THAT, WHILE REMAINING OF THE VIEW THAT

48:53 CUTTING IN SEPTEMBER, WE SEE THE FED IMPLEMENTING THE FIRST

48:54 CUT IN DECEMBER. THEY PUSHED TO JULY, THEY ARE

48:57 IT NOW TO DECEMBER. IT KEEPS COMING UP AGAIN AND

49:02 AGAIN THE IMPORTANCE OF SEPTEMBER AND THE LACK OF

49:04 WILLINGNESS TO DO ANYTHING AT THAT MEETING. LISA:

49:08 GIVEN THAT HISTORICALLY IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A BAD MOVE RIGHT

49:10 BEFORE AN ELECTION. YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

49:14 THIS SINCE JULY OR DECEMBER.

49:20 JONATHAN: EQUITY FUTURES WERE COVERING

49:24 JUST A LITTLE BIT SOFTER.

49:39 >> THERE IS VERY LITTLE ROOM FOR THE FED TO BE PARTICULARLY

49:43 DOVISH, QUICK, AND TERMS OF RATE CUTS.

49:48 >> AS LONG AS WE HAVE A REASONABLY STRONG ECONOMY I

49:49 THINK THAT THE MARKET CAN HANDLE THE FED STAYING STEADY.

49:54 >> THE MARKET HAS STARTED TO GAME OUT THE FED DECISION AND

49:57 TAKE IT OFF THE TABLE.

50:00 >> THEY WILL STILL PROBABLY BE ABLE TO CUT THIS YEAR.

50:04 >> CAN THEY CUT IN SEPTEMBER? IF THINGS SLOW DOWN ENOUGH, YES.

50:11 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE WITH JONATHAN

50:12 FERRO, LISA ABRAMOWICZ, AND ANNMARIE HORDERN. JONATHAN:

50:18 THE SECOND HOUR OF "BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE" STARTS NOW.

50:21 GOOD MORNING, GOOD MORNING. EQUITIES RECOVERING A LITTLE,

50:25 EQUITY FUTURES NEGATIVE BY 0.0 4%.

50:27 DOWN HARD ON THE MONTH SO FAR, BUT A LITTLE BIT OF PERSPECTIVE.

50:31 YES, THIS IS THE BIGGEST POTENTIAL MONTHLY LAW SINCE THE

50:34 END OF SEPTEMBER, DOWN BY SOMETHING LIKE 2.6%, BUT REALLY

50:37 THIS IS ABOUT THE FIVE MONTHS OF GAINS PREVIOUS TO THIS,

50:40 WHICH WERE OUT OF THIS WORLD. LISA:

50:44 THE FACT THAT WE ARE DOWN SO LITTLE TO ME IS TELLING GIVEN

50:49 THAT WE SAW SOME PRETTY BIG MISSES ON A NUMBER OF THE TECH

50:50 STOCKS. TO ME, THE SWINGING AROUND OF

50:56 THE TECH NAMES IS INTERESTING. AMAZON IS COMING OUT AFTER THE

50:58 BELL. WHAT IF THEY MISS ON AWS? JONATHAN:

51:02 AMAZON, AMAZON ON REPEAT. TWO DAYS OF APPLE ON THURSDAY.

51:10 WE DID A WHOLE SEGMENT WITH AN ANALYST. LISA: I DID WATCH IT.

51:14 I THINK EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT -- JONATHAN:

51:17 WHY DO YOU TUNE IN ON YOUR DAY OFF? LISA:

51:20 BECAUSE I LOVE YOU AND THIS IS WHERE I GET INFORMATION.

51:26 IT GOES BACK TO A FED CHAIR POWELL WILL POP THE QUESTION

51:27 TODAY. JONATHAN: IT IS ALL LOVE AND PROPOSALS

51:30 NOW. LISA: YESTERDAY, IT WASN'T GOING TO

51:32 MATTER WHAT HAPPENS AND TODAY IT IS ALMOST FLIPPING THE

51:36 SCRIPT. JONATHAN: LET'S TALK ABOUT BEARISHNESS IN

51:39 THE BOND MARKET. THE TWO YEAR AND 10 YEAR, MOVES

51:46 OF 30 PLUS BASIS POINTS AND MOVES A 40 PLUS BASIS POINTS ON

51:48 THE TWO-YEAR AND THE 10 YEAR. IF I TOLD YOU AT THE START OF

51:51 THE MONTH THAT THAT IS THE MOVE WE WOULD GET, MORE HOT

51:55 INFLATION PRINTS AND REPLIES THE YIELD CURVE HIGHER, WOULD

51:57 YOU GUESS EQUITIES WOULD ONLY BE DOWN 2.6%? LISA:

52:02 THIS HAS BEEN THE ISSUE, THE NARRATIVE SHIFT AROUND HOW MUCH

52:07 OF HIGHER RATES CAN THIS EQUITY MARKET TOLERATE?

52:08 IT TURNS OUT, QUITE A BIT. THEY ARE GETTING MORE BULLISH

52:14 ON CERTAIN RISK ASSETS BECAUSE RATES ARE HIGH FOR THE RIGHT

52:15 REASON. HOW LONG DOES THAT LAST DEPENDING ON A FED CHAIR

52:21 POWELL, WHO TRIES TO BE THE MOST BORING PERSON ON EARTH

52:23 TOMORROW, USES THE H-WORD. ANNMARIE:

52:28 IMMACULATE HIGH FOR LONGER. THIS PERENNIAL GOLDILOCKS HAS

52:32 GIVEN WAY TO NEW INFLATION FEARS AND THAT MAKES POWELL'S

52:33 JOB HARDER. HE HAS SAID ENOUGH THAT THIS

52:37 FED STORY THIS WEEK IS ALREADY IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR.

52:41 JONATHAN: BACKSEAT TO THE DATA AND

52:43 EARNINGS LATER THIS WEEK. AMAZON IS REALLY IMPORTANT

52:44 AFTER THE BELL. LISA: THANK YOU. JONATHAN:

52:48 I SAID THAT A FEW TIMES. ANNMARIE: ARE YOU PAYING FOR THE

52:53 SUBSCRIPTION? JONATHAN: COMING UP, YOU HEARD HIM.

52:57 WE ARE JOINED SHORTLY WITH STOCKS POISED FIVE MONTHS OF

53:03 GAINS. THE UPHEAVAL OF PARAMOUNT.

53:07 AND THE FED'S PATH FORWARD FOR CREDIT.

53:11 THE TOP STORY IS STOCKS ARE ON BECAUSE AWAITING EARNINGS COME

53:15 ECONOMIC DATA, AND A FED POLICY DECISION WITH AMAZON KICKING

53:18 OFF THINGS FOLLOWED BY THE FED DECISION TOMORROW.

53:20 APPLE IS ON THURSDAY AND THE JOBS REPORT ON FRIDAY.

53:25 SOLACE ALTERNATIVE ASSET MANAGEMENT, DAN, HOW IMPORTANT

53:29 IS AMAZON AFTER THE BELL? DAN: I THINK THAT WE NEED TO TALK

53:30 MORE ABOUT IT. JONATHAN: APPARENTLY. NAN:

53:35 IT IS ONE OF THE LARGEST STOCKS WITH A FEW DIFFERENT TOUCH

53:38 POINTS. AWS BEING THE CRUCIAL DRIVER

53:41 FOR THE STOCK AND HIS PERFORMANCE IN THE INDEX AND

53:43 IT'S TOUCH POINT WITH THE CONSUMER, ETC..

53:50 I THINK ANY NUMBER OF OTHER COMPANIES, MCDONALD'S ALSO

53:52 REPORTED, I THINK THAT THE FOCUS ON THOSE NAMES DOES

53:56 SOMETHING OF A DISSERVICE TO THE INFORMATION THAT CAN BE

53:57 PROVIDED TO A HOST OF OTHER COMPANIES. JONATHAN:

54:03 DO THINK THE FOCUS SHOULD BE ON THE EARNINGS OR THE FED? DAN:

54:07 NOW THE FOCUS IS ON THE FED. THE STRONG VALUE WE'VE HAD OFF

54:14 OF THE LOW, WHY ARE WE PAUSING

54:15 HERE? IT COMES IN THE CONTEXT OF THE

54:17 BIG RALLY OF THE LOW, BUT WE ARE PAUSING BECAUSE OF THE FED,

54:20 INFLATION, AND THOSE CONCERNS. EARNINGS SEASON HAS BEEN GOING

54:22 WELL ENOUGH, NOT AWESOME BUT PRETTY GOOD, AND RIGHT NOW THAT

54:26 IS THE FOCUS THE FED MEETING ON WEDNESDAY BECOMES CRUCIALLY

54:28 IMPORTANT. I THINK HE WILL BE BORING

54:31 BECAUSE HE IS THE FED CHAIRMAN AND THERE IS NO OTHER MODE BUT

54:33 BORING. LISA: I FIND IT INTERESTING, FRANKLY.

54:38 DAN: WE FIND IT INTERESTING BECAUSE

54:40 WE ARE NERDS. A NORMAL PERSON WOULD WATCH AND

54:43 THINK, THIS IS THE MOST BORING THING EVER. LISA:

54:48 YOU SAID THE ULTIMATE LEVEL OF RATES WON'T MATTER, IT IS THE

54:51 ADJUSTMENT PERIOD. GUESS WHAT, YOU ARE GOING WITH

54:55 THE NARRATIVE THAT 5% IN TERMS OF WHERE YIELDS ARE NOW WITH

54:57 BENCHMARK RATES, ISN'T THAT PROBLEMATIC FOR STOCKS?

55:00 HOW DO YOU THOSE THINGS WITH

55:06 THE IMPORTANCE AND INTEREST THAT I PERSONALLY HAVE BEEN FED

55:07 CHAIR POWELL TOMORROW?

55:15 DAN: FIRST OF ALL, I SHARE YOUR INTEREST AND EVERYONE ELSE AT

55:16 THE TABLE DOES AS WELL. YOU DON'T HAVE A MONOPOLY ON

55:18 BEING A NERD. DON'T TAKE MY WORD ON INTEREST

55:20 RATES. AS THIS CONVERSATION HAS GONE

55:24 ON I SEEM TO BE THE ONLY ONE ON FINANCIAL TV MAKING THE POINT

55:25 THAT INTEREST RATES HAVE GONE STRAIGHT UP ALL YEAR LONG.

55:33 FROM 4.20 -- THERE HAS BEEN AN 80-BASIS POINT MOVE.

55:37 WE HAVE REPRICED. , EVERYONE TALKS WE WERE

55:40 EXPECTING SIX CUTS AND NOW IT IS ONLY TWO MAYBE ONE.

55:47 WE ARE DOWN A LITTLE BIT, BUT NO BIG DEAL.

55:49 IT HAS OBVIOUSLY NOT BEEN A PROBLEM SO FAR.

55:53 I DON'T KNOW WHY ANOTHER 20 OR 10 BASIS POINTS IS THE STRAW

55:59 ACROSS THE PROVERBIAL CAMEL'S BACK. I THINK THE STOCK MARKET

56:02 SIMILARLY HAS DONE WELL. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY GETTING

56:08 BACK TO YOUR POINT ABOUT THE SHORT TERM -- I THINK THAT

56:11 THERE IS AN ADJUSTMENT PERIOD, A LITTLE UNCERTAINTY OBVIOUSLY.

56:18 INFLATION WAS STICKIER FOR A MONTH MORE THAN WE THOUGHT.

56:21 WE CAN SAY IF YOU X THIS AND IT ISTHAT -- THIS AND THAT IT

56:26 IS NOT THAT BAD. I THINK THAT WE NEED TO HEAR

56:33 WHAT HE HAS TO SAY, HOW HE CHARACTERIZES THE ENVIRONMENT,

56:35 BEFORE THE MARKET CAN RESUME WHAT I THINK WILL BE ANOTHER

56:36 PUSH HIGHER. LISA: DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE MARKETS

56:41 RALLY AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR OFF OF THE FED PIVOT LATE

56:44 LAST YEAR IS ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME OF THE

56:46 STICKINESS IN THE INFLATION DATA WE HAVE BEEN SEEING? DAN:

56:52 I FIND IT DIFFICULT -- I THINK YES.

56:57 HOW MUCH OF A CONTRIBUTOR IS DIFFICULT TO PROVE IN THE DATA.

57:02 I THINK IN RETROSPECT THE ENTHUSIASM FOR RATE CUTS BEFORE

57:08 THE DATA IN THE ENVIRONMENT CLEARLY CALLED FOR IT WAS

57:09 PROBABLY CORRECT. WHEN I SAY PROBABLY, I MEAN

57:14 EVEN AT THE TIME THERE WAS A LOT OF CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT IS

57:16 THE RUSH. I THINK THE RUSH IS WE WANT TO

57:22 CUT RATES BEFORE THE ELECTION, SUFFICIENTLY FAR ENOUGH FROM

57:25 THE ELECTION ASSUMING THE DATA COOPERATES.

57:27 CHARACTERIZING IT IN THE WAY THEY HAD IS PROBABLY NOT THE

57:32 BEST. IN RETROSPECT CERTAINLY, BUT EVEN AT THE TIME YOU COULD

57:36 HAVE WAITED ANOTHER MONTH OR TWO BEFORE YOU STARTED GETTING

57:37 ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT CUTTING RATES IN JUNE.

57:41 HAVING DONE THIS, AS WE HAVE,

57:47 FOR A FEW DECADES NOW, THE FEAR OF MARKETS, WE DON'T WANT TO BE

57:49 SEEN FOR PLAYING MARKETS. I FIND IT SILLY.

57:53 YOU COULD HAVE GONE ANOTHER MONTH OR TWO BEFORE YOU STARTED

57:57 SIGNALING WE ARE INTERESTING IN REDUCING RATES AS SOON AS THE

58:02 SUMMER.THE RUSH TO DO IT WHEN THEY DID WAS PROBABLY PREMATURE.

58:04 ANNMARIE: THEY RUSHED BECAUSE THEY

58:06 THOUGHT THAT THE DATA WAS GOOD THEN.

58:10 THE BUMPS, DOES THAT MEAN THAT THAT IS A TREND?

58:13 THREE MONTHS OF BUMPS? DAN: THE ULTIMATE REASON IS THEY

58:20 THOUGHT THAT THE DATA WOULD CONTINUE MOVING. JONATHAN:

58:24 WE ARE FOLLOWING. DAN: THEY THOUGHT THAT THE DATA

58:29 WOULD GO IN A CERTAIN DIRECTION AND IT OBVIOUSLY HAS NOT.

58:34 JANUARY AND FEBRUARY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE AN ABERRATION.

58:36 MARCH WAS A LITTLE HOTTER.

58:43 THE PC HAS BEEN BETTER, AND I THINK YOU CAN PARSE OUT THE

58:46 DATA AND IT IS NOT AS BAD AS THE HEADLINES HAVE SUGGESTED,

58:49 BUT NEITHER IS IT GOOD ENOUGH THAT YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE

58:51 CUTTING AS SOON AS THE SUMMER AND THAT IS THE QUANDARY IN

58:53 WHICH THEY FIND THEMSELVES. THE CREDIT MARKETS HAVE BEEN

58:57 STRONG. I WILL SAY THAT AS A TRADITIONAL HIGH-YIELD DISTRESS

59:02 MANAGER THERE HAS NOT IN AS MUCH DISTRESS.

59:06 YOU MIGHT NOT BE SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT THERE AREN'T TOO MANY

59:12 DEFAULTS, TOO MANY BANKRUPTCY SITUATIONS GIVEN HOW STRONG THE

59:13 ECONOMY HAS BEEN. THERE HAVE BEEN ONE OFFS HERE

59:17 AND THERE, BUT THE DEFAULT RATE REMAINS PRETTY LOW.

59:22 CROSS CREDIT IT IS A LOT OF FINDING THEMATIC TRADES, NOT

59:26 DISSIMILAR TO THE EQUITY MARKET. WE ARE SPENDING A LOT OF TIME

59:30 IN THE EQUITY MARKETS. THE RETURN POTENTIAL SEEMS MORE

59:33 ATTRACTIVE ON A RELATIVE BASIS. JONATHAN: WHY? DAN:

59:38 WE HAVE BEEN OPTIMISTIC ON THE ENERGY SPACE AS A FUND.

59:44 FROM A RETURN POTENTIAL STANDPOINT IT HAS BEEN MORE

59:46 ATTRACTIVE TO BE POSITIONS IN EQUITIES ACROSS THE CAPITAL,

59:50 ACROSS THE MARKET CAP SPECTRUM AS OPPOSED TO CREDITS.

59:56 ENERGY, DISTRESS, HIGH-YIELD, NOT REALLY A THING BECAUSE WE

01:00:01 BLEW UP THE SPACE, RESTRUCTURED, EMERGED, ETC.,

01:00:04 ETC.

01:00:06 TO GET BUYBACKS, ETC., YOU CAN DO WELL IN THE EQUITY MARKET

01:00:08 AND WE HAVE BEEN HAPPY WITH THAT PERFORMANCE. JONATHAN:

01:00:12 WE WILL HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH BLACKROCK LATER, BUT CAN

01:00:16 YOU DESCRIBE THE PRICE ACTION WITHIN HIGH-YIELD? THE

01:00:22 ARE STILL SUPERTIGHT. IS THERE WORRYING ABOUT THE

01:00:25 ABILITY TO REFINANCE LATER THIS YEAR? DAN:

01:00:33 LOWER CREDITS HAVE DONE BETTER. IN EQUITY, THE HIGHER CREDITS,

01:00:38 THE LARGE-CAP EQUITIES, HAVE DONE THE BEST. YOU SEE SPREAD

01:00:41 COMPRESSION, OUTPERFORMANCE ON

01:00:42 THE PART OF TRIPLE C'S, DOUBLE B'S, ETC.

01:00:47 SPEAKING TO THE BROADER ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, BUT ALSO

01:00:51 THE QUALITY OF THE HIGH-YIELD MARKET IS SOMETHING THAT I'M

01:00:56 SURE THAT YOU HAVE TALKED ABOUT WITH ANY HIGH-YIELD MANAGER WHO

01:01:02 HAS COME ON HERE.THE HIGH YOUR YIELD MARKET, THIS IS NOT YOUR

01:01:04 MOM'S HIGH-YIELD MARKET. IT IS MUCH HIGHER QUALITY FROM

01:01:10 A LEVERAGE STANDPOINT, CASH STANDPOINT, EVERYTHING IS

01:01:12 BETTER TODAY THAN IT HAS BEEN IN MOST PERIODS THROUGHOUT

01:01:14 HISTORY. WHEN MOST PEOPLE SAY THAT A

01:01:17 LOOK AT THE HIGH-YIELD MARKET IS TELLING YOU, Y, Z, IT IS

01:01:21 HARD TO DO THAT COMPARISON TO HISTORY NOT DISSIMILAR TO THE

01:01:23 EQUITY MARKET GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE LARGE-CAP BANKS. LISA:

01:01:29 TO PUT A BOW ON IT, ARE YOU WILLING TO SAY THAT ALL OF THE

01:01:32 PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT THIS IS A GOLDEN ERA FOR CREDIT IN THE

01:01:36 PUBLIC SPACE ARE WRONG AND EQUITIES HOLD A BETTER

01:01:37 RISK-REWARD VALUE? OR ARE YOU SAYING THAT SPECIFIC

01:01:43 ASSET CLASSES, LIKE WITHIN INDUSTRY, YOU ARE SEEING BETTER

01:01:44 VALUES IN EQUITIES? DAN: I LOOK AT THINGS THEMATICALLY.

01:01:50 I ALMOST JOKE AT THIS POINT TO SAY IT IS THE GOLDEN AGE OF

01:01:53 PRIVATE CREDIT. IN SOME RESPECTS IT HAS BEEN A

01:01:56 GOLDEN AGE FOR RISK ASSETS. I THINK THAT THAT HAS BORNE OUT

01:02:02 OF THE DATA, BORN OUT OF THE PERFORMANCE.

01:02:05 I THINK YOU HAVE A ROBUST ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.

01:02:07 THE CONSUMER HAS BEEN STRONG. THIS IS INCREDIBLY SURPRISING.

01:02:11 I DON'T THINK THAT ONE ASSET CLASS IS MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN

01:02:16 ANOTHER ON A PERMANENT BASIS, ALTHOUGH, TYPICALLY, HIGHER

01:02:17 RISK ASSETS GENERATE HIGHER REWARD OVER TIME.

01:02:22 I THINK AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS OR SO ON

01:02:26 A RISK-REWARD BASIS WE HAVE BEEN FINDING MORE OPPORTUNITIES

01:02:27 IN THE EQUITY SPACE. IT IS NOT JUST ENERGY.

01:02:33 IT IS A LOT OF CONSUMER FOCUSED STUFF AS WELL.

01:02:37 ONE OF THE WAYS WE POSITIONED OURSELVES A COUPLE OF YEARS

01:02:39 AGO, IT WAS THE FOCUS ON THE DWINDLING EXCESS RESERVES --

01:02:43 EXCESS CASH, CONSUMER BANK ACCOUNTS THAT NEVER MADE SENSE

01:02:46 TO US. THE CONSUMER ALWAYS SEEMED

01:02:48 STRONG. THERE WAS ALWAYS THE NEXT SHOE

01:02:52 TO DROP AND THE NEXT ISSUE NEVER CAME, SO WE FOUND A LOT

01:02:57 OF BEATEN UP LEISURE AND CONSUMER-FOCUSED NAMES TO BE

01:02:58 EXTREMELY ATTRACTIVE. I THINK IN A LOT OF RESPECTS

01:03:02 THEY REMAIN SO TODAY. I CAN'T SAY SPECIFICALLY WHAT

01:03:06 THEY ARE, BUT I THINK IT IS NOT A SECRET SOME OF THE THINGS

01:03:07 THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. JONATHAN: WE WON'T ASK.

01:03:17 DAN GREENHAUS, THANK YOU. LET'S GET IT UPDATED ON STORIES

01:03:21 ELSEWHERE. HERE IS DANI BURGER. DANI:

01:03:27 TWO TRADERS IN HONG KONG HAVE LEFT SOFT AND.

01:03:30 THEY DISCOVERED PEERLESS BETS THAT WENT UNDETECTED BY THE

01:03:31 RISK-MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. STOCKTON DID NOT LOSE MONEY

01:03:35 FROM THE TRANSACTIONS BUT THE TRADE COULD HAVE COST HUNDREDS

01:03:38 OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IF THERE HAD BEEN AN INTENSE MARKET

01:03:42 DOWNTURN. THE CHINESE TOP CLIMATE CHIEF

01:03:44 IS SAID TO HAVE HAD HIS FIRST OFFICIAL MEETING WITH HIS U.S.

01:03:47 COUNTERPART WITH TENSIONS LOOMING OVER ISSUES FROM SHIPS

01:03:49 TO CLEANTECH. HE SPOKE TO THE NORTH ASIA

01:03:52 CORRESPONDENT IN BEIJING.

01:03:55 >> THAT IS ONE WORRY. THESE CLIMATE CHANGE COMMUNITY.

01:04:02 I DEFINITELY HOPE THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL SUPPORT

01:04:08 THE GOVERNMENT TO STAY IN THE CLIMATE CHANGE PROCESS, IN

01:04:15 STAYING IN THE PARIS AGREEMENT, EVEN PAST THE ELECTION. DANI:

01:04:21 IT IS ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE ACCORDING TO A NEW REPORT FROM

01:04:26 BARCLAYS FOR LIQUIDITY, FUNCTIONING, AND HEIGHTEN

01:04:27 VOLATILITY. IT IS THE CONTINUATION OF A

01:04:31 TREND UNDERSCORED BY THE COVID-INDUCED DASH FOR CASH.

01:04:36 INCREASED TREASURY SUPPLY AND COMPLEX DEALER CONSTRAINTS, THE

01:04:40 STRATEGIST WRITING "THE SUBSTANTIAL SUPPLY OF

01:04:42 TREASURIES MEANS THAT REGULATORS AND INVESTORS ARE

01:04:44 FIGHTING AN UPHILL BATTLE." JONATHAN: APPRECIATE IT.

01:04:49 WE WILL CATCH UP WITH DANI IN 30 MINUTES. TESLA'S BUMPY YEAR.

01:04:55 >> ELON MUSK'S OPPORTUNITY TO SAY I WANT TO DO THIS.

01:05:00 YOU HAVE SEEN THE CLASHES BETWEEN U.S. AND CHINA.

01:05:04 TO ME THIS IS A TIME TO SAY I WILL CHANGE UP THIS MATH FOR

01:05:06 MYSELF.

01:05:54 JONATHAN: EQUITY FUTURES ON THE S&P ARE

01:05:58 NEGATIVE BY 0.05%. THE BOND MARKET YIELDS HIGHER

01:06:02 BY A SINGLE BASIS POINT. THE 10 YEAR, 4.62 81.

01:06:07 TESLA'S BUMPY YEAR.

01:06:09 >> ELON MUSK SAW AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO IN AND SAY I WANT TO DO

01:06:14 THIS. YOU HAVE SEEN THE CLASHES THAT

01:06:16 HAVE BEEN GOING ON BY THE U.S. AND CHINA.

01:06:19 HE IS TRYING TO PUT A FOOT IN BOTH SIDES AND ALL OF A SUDDEN

01:06:22 THE EV'S IN CHINA STARTED TO GET LESS EXPENSIVE AND THEY HAD

01:06:24 TO DROP PRICES. FOR ME THIS IS A WAY TO SAY I

01:06:28 AM GOING TO CHANGE UP THIS MATH FOR MYSELF, BUT ALSO IF I CAN

01:06:32 BE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS MAY BE I GET TO BE JONATHAN: THE OUTLIER.

01:06:35 JONATHAN:FRESH OFF OF A BREAKTHROUGH FOR IT

01:06:38 SELF DRIVING UNIT IN CHINA, TESLA IS SAID TO BE CONSIDERING

01:06:41 MORE JOB CUTS WITH TWO SENIOR EXECUTIVES SET TO DEPART THE

01:06:42 COMPANY. CO ELON MUSK WILL DISMISS

01:06:45 EVERYONE WORKING FOR THOSE EXECUTIVES WITH ONLY A FEW SET

01:06:49 TO BE REASSIGNED. WE'RE JOINED NOW FOR MORE.

01:06:52 THAT STOCK DOWN 1.8%. CRAIG, WHAT DO YOU THINK IS

01:06:55 GOING ON? CRAIG: THIS IS A REPORT BY THE

01:06:59 INFORMATION. WE SHOULD CREDIT THEM FOR THIS

01:07:01 INFORMATION.

01:07:07 THE TWO EXECUTIVES THAT THEY ARE GETTING RID OF, OF THE TWO

01:07:12 THAT ARE THE MOST INTERESTING TO ME IS THE EXECUTIVE IN

01:07:17 CHARGE OF THEIR SUPERCHARGER TEAM.

01:07:22 THIS IS A CROWN JEWEL WITHIN TESLA. A COMPANY THAT HAS PRIDED

01:07:23 ITSELF ON NOT ONLY MAKING ELECTRIC VEHICLES THAT PEOPLE

01:07:28 WANT TO BUY, BUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WILL

01:07:31 FACILITATE INTEREST IN ELECTRIC VEHICLES BEYOND EARLY ADOPTERS

01:07:32 WHO ARE WILLING TO TRY OUT SOMETHING NEW AND COPE WITH

01:07:37 EXPERIENCES OF HAVING TO WAIT FOR A PLUG.

01:07:43 I THINK IT IS ALSO INTERESTING TIMING IN THAT IN THE U.S., THE

01:07:50 REST OF THE INDUSTRY HAS EMBRACED TESLA'S CHARGING

01:07:51 STANDARD THAT THEY HAVE TRIED TO MAKE

01:07:57 THEIR PROPRIETARY PLUG OPEN TO THE INDUSTRY AND GET EVERYONE

01:08:01 ON BOARD WITH CHANGING THEIR PL UGS TO FIT WITH TESLA.

01:08:06 THE RUG IS SEEMINGLY BEING PULLED OUT FROM UNDER THE REST

01:08:10 OF THE INDUSTRY IN THAT THE PERSON LEADING A 500-PERSON

01:08:15 TEAM, ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION, IS GONE ALONG WITH

01:08:16 HER TEAM.

01:08:18 JONATHAN: GOING THROUGH THE NUMBERS YOU

01:08:23 HAVE BEEN GOING OVER THIS MORNING IN EUROPE, THE MERCEDES

01:08:24 FIRST-QUARTER EARNINGS DOWN BY

01:08:27 ONE THIRD, VOLKSWAGEN DOWN BY 20%.

01:08:30 ARE THEY STRUGGLING WITH THE SAME ISSUES TESLA HAS BEEN

01:08:35 STRUGGLING WITH OVER THE LAST FEW QUARTERS? CRAIG: YES AND NO.

01:08:40 IT IS THE CASE THAT THE HIGHER BORROWING COSTS THAT ELON MUSK

01:08:45 HAS CITED OVER AND OVER AS THE REASON FOR THEIR SLOWDOWN IS

01:08:48 BEING FELT BY THE WHOLE INDUSTRY.

01:08:53 WE ARE IN A NEW ERA OF -- BACK

01:08:56 WHEN THE CHIP CRISIS WAS RESTRICTING THESE COMPANY'S

01:08:59 PRODUCTION THEY HAD MORE DEMAND THAN THEY COULD MEET.

01:09:02 THAT IS OVER. WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE

01:09:06 EVERYONE IS PRODUCING MORE CARS THAN THEY HAVE DEMAND FOR.

01:09:09 THAT WILL MEAN PRICING PRESSURE. WE HAVE SEEN THAT MORE ACUTELY

01:09:13 WITH TESLA WHERE I WOULD DRAW THE DISTINCTION.

01:09:18 EV'S IN PARTICULAR HAVE HAD A MUCH MORE SUBSTANTIAL COME DOWN

01:09:23 IN PRICE THAT HAS HURT TESLA MORE SO THAN IT HAS DAMAGE THE

01:09:24 REST OF THE INDUSTRY. LISA:

01:09:30 CHINA IS THE JUGGERNAUT THAT IS PRODUCING MORE ELECTRIC

01:09:31 VEHICLES MORE CHEAPLY AND RAPIDLY THAN ANYWHERE ELSE.

01:09:36 HOW IMPORTANT IS IT FOR TESLA THAT HE GOT THIS IN PRINCIPLE

01:09:40 APPROVAL FOR THE DRIVER ASSISTANCE SYSTEM TO BE

01:09:41 DEPLOYED IN CHINA?

01:09:48 ESSENTIALLY, YOU HAVE ELON MUSK KOWTOWING TO XI JINPING BECAUSE

01:09:51 THAT IS THE ONLY WAY THIS COMPANY CAN REGAIN CLOUT? CRAIG:

01:09:56 IT WAS OBVIOUSLY A HUGE SUCCESS IN CHANGING THE NARRATIVE.

01:10:03 WE HAVE BEEN SEEING DAY AFTER DAY EVIDENCE OF THIS COMPANY'S

01:10:04 EARNINGS POWER FALLING APART. WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST FEW

01:10:09 WEEKS TESLA CUT PRICING IN CHINA AGAIN.

01:10:15 ANALYSTS CASTING DOUBT AS TO IF THERE ARE ANY EARNINGS LEFT FOR

01:10:20 TESLA'S CHINA IN THEIR OPERATIONS.

01:10:23 THERE IS THE POTENTIAL TO GET MORE INCREMENTAL REVENUE OUT OF

01:10:27 EACH CAR THAT THEY SELL, OR THEIR EXISTING FLEET TO GET

01:10:32 PEOPLE TO PAY FOR THEIR DRIVER ASSISTANCE SYSTEM.

01:10:37 YET, THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE FOR THAT

01:10:42 IN PRINCIPLE APPROVAL TO BE A HARD AND FAST APPROVAL.

01:10:45 THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY WILL BE ABLE TO

01:10:49 CHARGE.JUST AS THERE'S PRICING PRESSURE FOR THE VEHICLES

01:10:52 THEMSELVES IN CHINA, THE DRIVER ASSISTANCE SYSTEMS ARE PRETTY

01:10:56 COMMON IN CHINA. OTHER CAR COMPANIES ARE

01:11:00 CHARGING NEARLY AS MUCH FOR THIS FUNCTIONALITY AS TESLA HAS

01:11:03 BEEN CHARGING IN THE U.S.. THERE IS A QUESTION ABOUT HOW

01:11:10 MUCH OF A REVENUE BOOST MUSK MAY BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF THIS.

01:11:13 ANNMARIE: DID HE GO TO CHINA FOR THIS

01:11:16 REASON BECAUSE HE WANTS TO SHOW THE UNITED STATES THAT HE CAN

01:11:18 GET APPROVAL SOMEWHERE? HE IS HAVING REGULATORY ISSUES

01:11:20 IN THE U.S. CRAIG: GOOD QUESTION.

01:11:26 IT IS THE CASE HE HAS BEEN COZY WITH CHINA GOING BACK MANY

01:11:32 YEARS NOW. THIS IS A COMPANY THAT WAS THE

01:11:34 FIRST CAR MANUFACTURER THAT WAS ABLE TO SET UP SHOP IN CHINA

01:11:37 WITHOUT HAVING TO ESTABLISH A JOINT VENTURE WITH A LOCAL CAR

01:11:38 COMPANY. THAT WAS HUGE.

01:11:45 HE WAS ABLE TO GET RED CARPET TREATMENT OUT OF THE THEN TOP

01:11:52 PERSON IN THE GOVERNMENT IN SHANGHAI, WHO IS NOW THE

01:11:54 PREMIER OF XI JINPING'S ADMINISTRATION.

01:12:01 FOR HIM TO HAVE SECURED THAT, GOTTEN ALL OF THE HELP THAT HE

01:12:03 DID DURING THE PANDEMIC KEEPING THE FACTORY OPEN, IT HAS BEEN

01:12:08 SUCH A HUGE DRIVER OF TESLA'S SUCCESS.

01:12:12 THIS TRIP SEEMS TO SEND A SIGNAL TO WASHINGTON THAT MUSK

01:12:17 REMAINS CLOSE WITH THE CCP AND IS ABLE TO GET PREFERENTIAL

01:12:25 TREATMENT, SO IT SEEMS. -- SO IT SEEMS, THAT OTHER

01:12:28 AUTOMAKERS HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO PULL OFF. JONATHAN:

01:12:34 A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONS. HOW CAN HE MAINTAIN THIS

01:12:36 RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA AT A TIME WHEN WE ARE ALL EXPECTING

01:12:41 EV'S TO BE GETTING TARIFFED PRETTY HARD LATER THIS YEAR,

01:12:45 CHINESE EV'S COMING INTO THE UNITED STATES?

01:12:49 IF THE FORMER PRESIDENT BECOMES THE NEXT PRESIDENT MAY BE THOSE

01:12:51 WALLS WILL BE EVEN HIGHER. HOW SUSTAINABLE IS THIS

01:12:53 RELATIONSHIP? CRAIG: IT IS A VERY VALID QUESTION AND

01:12:58 WE HAVE TO SEPARATE HOW MUCH OF THE U.S. WILL GO AFTER TESLA'S

01:13:01 OPERATIONS IN CHINA. IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT THEY

01:13:06 WOULD INTERFERE WITH THE COMPANY HAVING SOME SUCCESS IN

01:13:08 A FOREIGN MARKET.

01:13:14 TO YOUR POINT, I THINK THERE IS A QUESTION ABOUT HOW WILLING

01:13:18 AND OPEN WASHINGTON WILL BE FOR THIS TO TURN INTO A

01:13:23 RELATIONSHIP WHERE CATL, THE BATTERY COMPANY IN CHINA,

01:13:29 BECOMES EVEN MORE OF A SUPPLIER TO TESLA FOR THE U.S.

01:13:32 THERE IS NOT INTEREST IN FACILITATING THAT. JONATHAN:

01:13:34 THANK YOU, SIR. I JUST WONDER HOW WELCOMING

01:13:39 BEIJING WILL BE WHEN THOSE TARIFFS START TO CLIMB.

01:13:45 WE WILL CATCH UP WITH THE STORY AROUND PARAMOUNT, EXPECTING TO

01:14:02 JONATHAN: A BIG DAY TO DAY, NUMBERS FROM

01:14:03 AMAZON THIS AFTERNOON. LISA: THAT WAS GREAT. JONATHAN:

01:14:07 I CAN DO IT AGAIN IF YOU WANT. AMAZON LATER THIS AFTERNOON.

01:14:12 LISA: IT'S BEEN A BIG DEAL. THAT'S GOOD. JONATHAN:

01:14:15 THANKS FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT. THE NASDAQ IS -0.1%.

01:14:23 THE RUSSELL IS DOWN BY MORE THAN 5% ON THE MONTH, BRUTAL.

01:14:29 REPRICING IN THE BOND MARKET THIS MONTH, THE TWO-YEAR UP BY

01:14:32 30 BASIS POINTS IN THE TENURE UP BY MORE THAN 14.

01:14:40 GOING TOWARDS PAYROLLS, THE ESTIMATE SURVEY -- THE ESTIMATE

01:14:43 FOR FRIDAY IS FOR AROUND 250,000 , 240,000 WHICH IS

01:14:48 PRETTY PUNCHY. LISA: I THINK THERE IS MORE OF A

01:14:53 FOCUS ON WHAT KIND OF JOBS THERE ARE.

01:14:55 IT'S NOT JUST THE NUMBER, IT'S WHAT QUALITY OF JOBS, WHAT THAT

01:14:59 PAY LOOKS LIKE. COULD THE AVERAGE PAY ACTUALLY

01:15:03 COME IN BECAUSE THERE ARE LOWER WAGE KIND OF EMPLOYMENT?

01:15:08 THIS IS THE REASON WHY IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO WATCH CPI

01:15:12 COMING OUT IN ABOUT AN HOUR AS WELL AS JOLTS TOMORROW AND

01:15:14 OTHER LABOR MARKET DATA. JONATHAN:

01:15:16 WE WILL BREAK THAT DOWN ABOUT 60 MINUTES.

01:15:23 ISM MANUFACTURING TOMORROW, IN SOME WAYS, SOMETIMES THE ISM

01:15:26 SERVICES INDEX HAS MORE POTENTIAL TO WHIPSAW THIS

01:15:27 MARKET AND MAYBE EVEN PAYROLLS. LISA:

01:15:33 WE SAW THE S&P GLOBAL SERVICES COME IN AND SURPRISE MUCH MORE

01:15:36 SIGNIFICANTLY THAN ANY OF THE DATA. JAY POWELL TRIED TO BE AS

01:15:40 BORING AS POSSIBLE TOMORROW. JONATHAN:

01:15:43 THAT'S THE PROMO FOR OUR SPECIAL FED COVERS TOMORROW

01:15:50 AFTERNOON.

01:15:51 EURO-DOLLAR AND DOLLAR-YEN, THE EURO AT THE MOMENT IS ABOUT

01:15:55 UNCHANGED AT $1.07 AND THE DATA OUT OF EUROPE IS BETTER.

01:16:02 THEY ARE DOING BETTER THAN EXPECTED IN THE EURO IS STILL

01:16:06 IN AND AROUND 107 -- $1.07.

01:16:12 IF I TOLD YOU ONE DOLLAR 57 CENTS A WEEK AGO, YOU MIGHT SAY

01:16:13 IT PROBLEMATIC. IT'S STILL A PROBLEM FOR THE

01:16:18 BOJ. HOW MUCH OF A PROBLEM IT IS I

01:16:22 DON'T KNOW. THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE HAS

01:16:26 BEEN VERY VOCAL ABOUT THIS AND THE BOJ'S BEEN VERY QUIET AND

01:16:30 IT SEEMED TO BE SATISFIED BASED ON ITS COMMUNICATION WITH WHERE

01:16:31 POLICY IS AND WHERE MARKETS ARE. LISA: THIS IS THE REASON WHY THE

01:16:35 MARKET IS NOT REALLY BELIEVING THEY WILL INTERVENE WITH ANY

01:16:38 KIND OF CONVICTION. THAT'S THE REASON WHY PEOPLE

01:16:41 ARE WILLING TO FIGHT THE FOREIGN MINISTER IN THE

01:16:45 MINISTRY OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE IN JAPAN BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T A

01:16:48 STRONG CONNECTION AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT FROM THE BANK

01:16:52 OF JAPAN. IS IT A VICTORY FOR THE YEN TO

01:16:56 TRADE AROUND $1.55 VERSUS THE $1.70 THAT PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT

01:16:58 LAST WEEK. JONATHAN:

01:17:05 DOLLAR YEN AT THE MOMENT IS ONE DOLLAR 56.

01:17:06 SECRETARY OF STATE ANTONY BLINKEN URGING HAMAS LEADERS TO

01:17:09 QUICKLY MAKE A DECISION ON ISRAELI CONDITIONS FOR A

01:17:13 TEMPORARY CEASE-FIRE. HE DID NOT DISCLOSE SPECIFICS

01:17:16 BUT HE SAID ISRAEL HAD BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY GENEROUS IN

01:17:19 THEIR PROPOSALS. WE TALKED ABOUT THIS A FEW

01:17:22 TIMES. THERE'S PLENTY OF SPECULATION

01:17:23 THAT WE ARE CLOSER TO A DEAL THAN WE HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST

01:17:28 BUT WE HAD SOME COMMENTS FROM THE ISRAELI LEADER ABOUT AN

01:17:30 HOUR AGO WHICH SUGGESTED THE OBJECTIVES HAVE NOT CHANGED.

01:17:33 LISA: ANNMARIE: IF ISRAEL AND HAMAS CAN STRIKE

01:17:39 THIS DEAL AND BASED ON REPORTING, THEY ARE MEETING

01:17:41 TODAY TO DISCUSS THIS IN CAIRO YET THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

01:17:48 STATES IS PUTTING PRESSURE ON OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE MIDDLE

01:17:52 EAST. THE IDEA THAT WE STOP THE WAR BEFORE ACHIEVING THE GOALS,

01:17:58 WE WILL ENTER ROFF AND THE LIMITED HAMAS.

01:18:00 EVEN IF THERE IS A DEAL, WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR RAFAH?

01:18:04 IS THE CEASE-FIRE FOR A FEW MONTHS OR IS THE CEASE-FIRE A

01:18:07 REAL CEASE-FIRE? LISA: THERE ARE MANY MORE QUESTIONS

01:18:09 THAN ANSWERS. WE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT

01:18:15 PIECE WOULD LOOK LIKE OR THAT NONMILITARY ACTION WOULD LOOK

01:18:19 LIKE AT A TIME WHEN THERE ISN'T WILLINGNESS FOR ANYONE TO STEP

01:18:20 IN AND OVERSEE IT. JONATHAN: WHAT'S GOING ON AT COLUMBIA

01:18:25 UNIVERSITY? LISA: IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE IS A

01:18:33 LITTLE BIT MORE ACTION WITH ONE PARTICULAR BUILDING. JONATHAN:

01:18:36 IT HAPPENED AT 2 P.M. YESTERDAY. ANNMARIE:

01:18:39 SOME STUDENTS WERE SUSPENDED AND SOME STUDENTS DECIDED THAT

01:18:45 THEY OCCUPIED ONE BUILDING ON COLUMBIA CAMPUS.

01:18:46 AT THE MOMENT, THEY ARE STILL OCCUPYING THE BUILDING.

01:18:48 JONATHAN: WE WILL SEE HOW PEACE TALKS GO

01:18:51 AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY. YOU'VE GOT SERIOUS ISSUES

01:18:55 TAKING PLACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND YOU GOT THIS TAKING PLACE

01:18:57 AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY. LISA: IT DOESN'T REALLY FEEL

01:19:02 COMFORTABLE AND YET IT IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST POLITICAL

01:19:06 DEBATES IN ONE OF THE BELOW BIGGEST POLITICAL LIABILITIES

01:19:08 FOR JOE BIDEN. IT'S RAISE THE QUESTION ABOUT

01:19:13 UNIVERSITIES BEING THE HEARTBEAT OF INTELLECTUAL

01:19:15 THOUGHT AT A TIME WHEN PEOPLE ARE ARGUING THERE IS NOT

01:19:18 ACTUALLY AN EXCHANGE OF IDEAS GOING ON IN AN ACTIVE WAY BUT

01:19:21 RATHER IT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE KIND OF HUNKERED DOWN AND

01:19:23 NOT WANTING TO DISCUSS IT. ANNMARIE:

01:19:27 THIS IS DIFFICULT FOR JOE BIDEN IN NOVEMBER BECAUSE THESE ARE

01:19:31 THE INDIVIDUALS, YOUNG PROGRESSIVES THAT WOULD VOTE

01:19:34 FOR HIM AND THIS IS ANOTHER REASON WHY DECIDES THE

01:19:38 HUMANITARIAN ISSUE IN GAZA BUT DOMESTICALLY, IS ANOTHER REASON

01:19:40 WHY THEY WANT TO GET. THIS DEAL OVER THE FINISH LINE

01:19:44 JONATHAN:+ BEFORE CHRISTMAS, IT WAS NAILED

01:19:49 WHEN IT WAS SAID THIS IS NOT ABOUT FREEDOM OF SPEECH, IT'S

01:19:50 ABOUT PREFERRED SPEECH. LET'S TURN TO THE FEDERAL

01:19:56 RESERVE, DAY ONE OF THE TWO DAY MEETING FOR THE FEDERAL

01:20:00 RESERVE, WIDELY EXPECTED TO KEEP RATES ON HOLD.

01:20:04 WE ARE LOOKING FOR A HAWKISH TONE FROM JAY POWELL TOMORROW.

01:20:10 ELSEWHERE, A PEOPLE AT PARAMOUNT, SHARES ARE LOWER IN

01:20:14 THE PREMARKET AS THE COMPANY REPLACED THE CEO WITH THE

01:20:15 MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE AND THEY WILL LEAD THE COMPANY AS THEY

01:20:23 NEGOTIATED POTENTIAL DEAL WITH POTENTIAL INDIVIDUAL PRODUCER

01:20:24 SKY DANCE MEDIA.

01:20:30 BLOOMBERG INTELLIGENCE JOINS US NOW.

01:20:36 THE BIG EXCLUSIVE, THE EARNINGS CALL, CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT

01:20:39 HAPPENED ON THE EARNINGS CALL YESTERDAY AFTERNOON?

01:20:41 >> THANK YOU. THIS WAS UNPRECEDENTED, THIS

01:20:47 WAS THE SHORTEST CALL EVER I'VE SEEN IN THE HISTORY OF MEDIA

01:20:50 EARNINGS, ABOUT EIGHT MINUTES LONG. IT WAS BIZARRE.

01:20:56 THERE WAS THE MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE THAT SPOKE BRIEFLY

01:20:59 THEN YOU HAD THE CFO DELIVERING THE RESULTS.

01:21:04 THERE WAS ABSENTLY NO QUESTION FROM THE ANALYST COMMUNITY AND

01:21:07 THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY SO IT WAS REALLY MORE NOT WHAT WAS

01:21:10 SAID BUT RATHER WHAT WAS NOT SAID WHICH TELLS US THAT A DEAL

01:21:13 IS IMMINENT. JONATHAN:

01:21:14 CAN YOU TALK TO US ABOUT THE SO-CALLED MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE,

01:21:17 THIS TRIO OF EXECUTIVES? WHO ARE THEY AND WHO DO THEY

01:21:20 REPRESENT? THERE WERE REPORTS OF THE

01:21:25 FORMER CEO IS NOT HAPPY WITH THIS DEAL THAT WAS ON THE TABLE.

01:21:27 DO WE ASSUME THESE THREE ARE HAPPY WITH IT?

01:21:33 >> I DON'T THINK SO, THE LEADERSHIP COMMITTEE IS KIND OF

01:21:34 A STOPGAP ARRANGEMENT. IT'S DEFINITELY TRANSITORY AND

01:21:38 IT'S NOT THE LONG-TERM STRATEGIC DIRECTION THAT SHERRY

01:21:42 REDSTONE WILL TAKE OR THAT SKY DANCE WILL TAKE.

01:21:46 THE THREE EXECUTIVES ARE REALLY JUST THE DIVISION CHIEFS AT

01:21:50 PARAMOUNT SO YOU HAVE THE CBS CHIEF AND CHRIS MCCARTHY FROM

01:21:53 MTV AND SOME OF THE OTHER NETWORKS AND THEN YOU HAVE

01:21:56 BRIAN ROBBINS. THEY BEEN LEADING THE DIFFERENT

01:22:03 DIVISIONS BUT YOU ARE RIGHT, BOB BACCHUS VEHEMENTLY OPPOSED

01:22:04 TO SKY DANCE DEAL.

01:22:10 HE PROTESTED AGAINST IT WITH SHERRY REDSTONE AND THAT

01:22:11 ULTIMATELY LED TO THIS OUSTER. LISA: WILL THIS MAKE US MORE

01:22:16 COMFORTABLE THAT THIS WAS A SHORT CALL AND WE DON'T HAVE A

01:22:21 CLEAR SENSE OF THE DEAL AND WE DON'T HAVE A SENSE OF WHO THE

01:22:23 PERMANENT LEADERSHIP WILL BE GOING FORWARD?

01:22:28 >> I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR AT THIS POINT, THERE IS THIS

01:22:31 LOOMING DEADLINE SO MAY 3 WHICH IS THIS FRIDAY IS WHEN THE

01:22:38 EXCLUSIVE NEGOTIATING PERIOD ENDS SO THEY ARE LOOKING TO GET

01:22:40 SOMETHING DONE RIGHT BEFORE THAT.

01:22:44 THAT'S WHY YOU HAD THAT WHOLE LEADERSHIP CHANGE AND THEY ARE

01:22:46 WORKING HARD AND SKY DANCE SWEETEN THEIR OFFER A LITTLE

01:22:49 BIT. THEY ARE NOW OFFERING $3 BILLION OF CASH INFUSION INTO

01:22:53 THE COUNTRY -- INTO THE COMPANY TO S WAGE INVESTORS AND IT

01:22:58 LOOKS LIKE SHERRY REDSTONE HAS SAID SHE'S OPEN TO THIS

01:23:00 MAJORITY OF THE MINORITY VOTE WHICH MEANS SHE'S ACTUALLY

01:23:03 ALLOWING THE NONVOTING SHAREHOLDERS TO HAVE A SAY.

01:23:07 THIS IS A WAY TO APPEASE INVESTORS WHO HAVE BEEN VERY

01:23:10 OPPOSED TO THIS DEAL FROM THE GET GO. LISA:

01:23:15 IS THERE SOMETHING AWAY THAT WE CAN TAKE AS A BROADER MESSAGE

01:23:18 AS TO WHAT MEDIA LOOKS LIKE GOING FORWARD?

01:23:23 SHERRY REDSTONE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT BOB PACKAGE EARLIER

01:23:26 BECAUSE HE DIDN'T SELL SHOWTIME AND BAE T -- NBT EARLIER.

01:23:34 IN TERMS OF STREAMLINING OPERATIONS AND DEVELOPING

01:23:35 POPULAR CONTENT, IS THIS A MATTER OF SIMPLY JETTISONING

01:23:40 UNITS THAT ARE NOT AS PROFITABLE OR IS IT ABOUT

01:23:42 INVESTING IN ORIGINAL CONTENT OR IS IT ABOUT BEING SOLD AND

01:23:43 DONE WITH IT?

01:23:49 >> PARENT DISH PARAMOUNT HAS UNIQUE SET OF CHALLENGES.

01:23:53 ALL OF THESE COMPANIES WERE KIND OF FACED WITH THIS

01:23:57 DIFFICULT CHALLENGE OF PIVOTING AWAY FROM THEIR LINEAR TV

01:24:00 NETWORK BUSINESS TO STREAMING AND SOME COMEDIES CAN DO IT

01:24:01 BETTER THAN OTHERS. DISNEY HAS BEEN FAIRLY

01:24:03 SUCCESSFUL, WARNER BROS. DISCOVERING THAT A FAIR AMOUNT

01:24:07 OF SUCCESS. PARAMOUNT IS NOT REALLY BEEN

01:24:10 THAT LUCKY. THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE

01:24:15 CRITICISMS LEVELED AGAINST BOB BAKISH.

01:24:19 HE MANAGED TO GET 70 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS ON THE PARAMOUNT

01:24:21 PLUS SERVICE BUT IT'S COME AT A HUGE COST. THE STREAMING

01:24:25 BUSINESS HAS LOST $5 BILLION. THAT'S SINCE ITS INCEPTION AND

01:24:30 IT'S HIGHLY DOUBTFUL IT WILL EVER BE PROFITABLE.

01:24:35 SHOULD PARAMOUNT HAVE EVEN UNDERTAKEN THE STREAMING

01:24:36 STRATEGY IN THE FIRST PLACE? IT'S NOT THE RIGHT STRATEGY FOR

01:24:39 EVERYONE AND NOT FOR PARAMOUNT. THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN A CONTENT

01:24:42 ARMS DEALER. THAT'S THE CRITICISM AGAINST

01:24:48 BOB BAKISH FOR DOING WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE WAS DOING. LISA:

01:24:52 WE HEAR ABOUT SKY DANCE BUT WHAT'S THE STATUS OF THE APOLLO

01:24:57 BID?

01:24:58 >> I THINK THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY FORMAL OFFER FROM THEM

01:25:04 AFTER THAT $26 BILLION OFFER WHICH WAS REJECTED BY SHERRY

01:25:06 REDSTONE. I THINK THEY ARE WAITING FOR

01:25:09 THIS MAY 3 DEADLINE AND THEN THEY WILL COME OUT WITH A MORE

01:25:11 CONCRETE OFFER. RUMOR IS THEY ARE WORKING WITH

01:25:17 SONY TO LIFT THAT OFFER A LITTLE BIT, UP FROM 26 BILLION

01:25:21 TO MAYBE $29 BILLION OR HIGHER. WE DON'T KNOW THE DETAILS YET

01:25:24 BUT WE WILL HEAR FROM THEM LATER THIS WEEK. ANNMARIE:

01:25:30 THREE FEELS LIKE A CROWD SO WHO HOLDS THE POWER IN THIS TROIKA

01:25:32 OF CEOS?

01:25:36 >> I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS. ULTIMATELY, THE POWERS HELD BY

01:25:41 SHERRY REDSTONE. SHE CALLS THE SHOTS. JONATHAN:

01:25:45 WE'VE SEEN THAT DEMONSTRATED QUITE CLEARLY IN THE LAST FEW

01:25:47 HOURS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THE BIGGEST THING POTENTIALLY

01:25:51 HAPPENING IN MEDIA AND THE LAST WEEK OR SO IS THE MOST OBVIOUS

01:25:55 THING THAT SHOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE A LONG TIME AGO WHICH IS

01:25:58 THE SUPER BOWL TAKING PLACE ON PRESIDENTS' DAY WEEKEND.

01:26:05 ROGER GOODELL PROPOSING FOR YEARS AND WHY ISN'T IT HELD ON

01:26:06 PRESIDENTS' DAY WEEKEND? LISA: SOME PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO WAKE

01:26:10 UP EARLY THE NEXT DAY CANNOT WATCH THE WHOLE THING JONATHAN:.

01:26:14 IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT ME OR YOU. IT'S LIKE AN ALL DAY BREAKFAST

01:26:17 AT MCDONALD'S. IT'S OBVIOUS.

01:26:23 THE BRIT HAD TO COME TO AMERICA TO RUN MCDONALD'S AND THAT

01:26:24 MAKES SENSE. ANNMARIE: ALL DAY BREAKFAST IN THE UNITED

01:26:28 KINGDOM? JONATHAN: THIS IS LIKE THE ALL DAY

01:26:31 BREAKFAST DECISION OF THE NFL. IT'S SO OBVIOUS, GET IT DONE.

01:26:36 LISA: IS THE GOAL TO GET MORE VIEWERSHIP?

01:26:39 I THINK THEY DID PRETTY WELL. JONATHAN:

01:26:42 YOU WOULD GET EVEN MORE THIS WAY.

01:26:44 YOU CAN WAKE UP IN MONDAY AND DO WHAT YOU WANT. LISA:

01:26:47 THAT'S YOUR ULTIMATE GOAL BECAUSE YOU ARE A PARTY ANIMAL.

01:26:50 JONATHAN: A BIG PARTIER, EVERYONE KNOWS

01:26:52 THAT. LET'S GET YOU A BLOOMBERG BRIEF. DANI:

01:26:56 I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO THAT BUT WHAT I WILL SAY IS I

01:26:59 CAN CHECK SUMMER EARNINGS. SAMSUNG IS UP 1% WITH ANOTHER

01:27:05 CASE OF AI POWERED EARNINGS. THE SEMICONDUCTOR DIVISION

01:27:08 RETURN PROFITABILITY AND INCOME ROSE MORE THAN FOURFOLD FROM A

01:27:12 YEAR EARLIER. DEMAND FOR CHIPS TO DEVELOP AI

01:27:14 HAS BEEN INSATIABLE AS SAMSUNG SAYS THERE ARE NO SIGNS IT WILL

01:27:18 LET UP THIS YEAR. IF AI IS ONE UNRELENTING

01:27:21 EARNINGS BOOST, WEIGHT LOSS DRUGS ARE ANOTHER.

01:27:27 ELI LILLY SHARES OR HIGHER BITE 6% IN THE MARKET.

01:27:34 IT PULLED IN 517 MILLION DOLLARS OF SALES FOR THE DRUG

01:27:37 AND IT HAD SIMILAR SUCCESS WITH THIS OTHER WEIGHT LOSS DIABETES

01:27:39 DRUG. FILE LILY SHARES GAINED 26%

01:27:41 THIS YEAR. WALMART IS ABANDONING PLANS TO

01:27:46 BUILD OUT A NETWORK OF LOW-COST HEALTH CLINICS.

01:27:51 IT'S SAID ESCALATING COSTS AND REIMBURSEMENT CHALLENGES WERE

01:27:55 TO BLAME.

01:27:57 THEY WILL CLOSE THEIR TELEHEALTH BUSINESS ON WALMART

01:27:59 LAUNCH THE INITIATIVE IN 2019. LAST YEAR, AND PROMISED TO OPEN

01:28:04 MORE THAN 75 CENTERS ACROSS THE U.S. BY THE END OF 2024.

01:28:07 THAT'S YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF. I WILL SEND IT BACK TO YOU,

01:28:09 PARTY ANIMAL. JONATHAN: NOBODY BELIEVES THAT.

01:28:16 I'M THE FIRST ONE IN BED AT 7 P.M. LISA:

01:28:19 THIS GUY GOES TO A BAR AND HAS PEPPERMINT TEA. JONATHAN:

01:28:21 THAT IS A TRUE STORY.

01:28:27 EVERYONE THINKS YOU MIGHT BE HAVING A DRINK. LISA:

01:28:30 YOU'RE GETTING WILD. JONATHAN: GETTING READY TO BE BACK ON AIR

01:28:34 MONDAY.

01:28:40 WHO WAS SITTING ME NEXT TO ME ON THE PLANE MONDAY?

01:28:41 LESTER HOLT. JUST TO HAVE A GOOD VOICE

01:28:47 MONDAY FOR THE AUDIENCE, ANNMARIE:

01:28:48 SOME OF US WERE ASKING THE PRESIDENT QUESTIONS. JONATHAN:

01:28:50 MAKING THE CASE FOR CREDIT.

01:28:55 >> THE CASE CAN BE MADE THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT FORFEITURE AND

01:28:58 BETTER FINANCIAL HELP. I THINK CREDIT HAS A SPACE.

01:29:03 JONATHAN:

01:29:19 ♪ JONATHAN: EQUITIES ON THE S&P 500 ARE NEGATIVE BY 0.1%.

01:29:24 YIELDS ARE SLIGHTLY HIGHER. LATER THIS MORNING, THE

01:29:30 EMPLOYMENT COST INDEX DROPPING AT 8:30 A.M.

01:29:32 FOR THE FIRST QUARTER AND MICHAEL MCKEE WILL BREAK THAT

01:29:36 DOWN LATER THIS MORNING.

01:29:38 MAKING A CASE FOR CREDIT -- >> CAN FED TERMS, THEY ARE LOOKING

01:29:39 AT TIGHT SPREADS. THE CASE CAN BE MADE THAT WE

01:29:44 ARE LOOKING AT CORPORATE SWITCHER IN BETTER FINANCIAL

01:29:48 HELP THAN THEY HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY.

01:29:51 I THINK CREDIT DEFINITELY HAS A SPACE DESPITE HOW TIGHT IT IS

01:29:55 FROM AN ALL IN PERSPECTIVE, THERE IS ROOM FOR JONATHAN:

01:29:58 CREDIT IN PORTFOLIOS. INVESTORS ARE AWAITING THE FED

01:30:01 DECISION TOMORROW. THE CENTRAL BANK WILL KEEP

01:30:03 RATES HIGHER FOR LONGER.

01:30:15 POLICY NORMALIZATION --

01:30:26 SHE JOINS US NOW FOR MORE. THIS IS BRILLIANT, NOT ALL RATE

01:30:30 CUTS ARE CREATED EQUALLY AND NOT ALL DELAYS ARE EITHER.

01:30:34 IS THIS A HEALTHY DELAY?

01:30:37 >> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. SO FAR, IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S A

01:30:40 HEALTHY DELAYS BECAUSE IT SUPPORTED BY GROWTH.

01:30:43 THE LONGER THESE RATE CUTS ARE POSTPONED, THE MORE CREDENCE WE

01:30:48 GET TO THE POSSIBILITY OF RATE HIKES. THAT UNCERTAINTY AROUND

01:30:53 MONETARY POLICY IS JUST NOT A GREAT BACKDROP FOR CREDIT AND

01:30:57 NOT ABOUT DROP FOR M&A ORDEAL DEBT -- OR DEALMAKING.

01:30:59 ITS CLARITY ON THE MACRO WE NEED, NOT NECESSARILY A

01:31:02 FAVORABLE MACRO IN TERMS OF RATE REDUCTIONS.

01:31:06 THE CLARITY IS KEY AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON. JONATHAN:

01:31:10 WE'VE HAD A PRETTY RESILIENT CREDIT MARKET IN THE FACE OF

01:31:15 REPRICING. WHAT'S BEHIND THAT RESILIENCE?

01:31:17 >> RESILIENT GROWTH IS ONE OF THEM AND THAT'S BEEN IMPORTANT

01:31:19 FOR SPECULATIVE ISSUERS. ISSUERS HAVE MORE OF A CUSHION

01:31:24 IT CAN HANDLE A DOWNTURN IN GROWTH AND HIGH DEED -- AND

01:31:29 HIGH-GRADE AND GROWTH NOT SO MUCH. WE TALKED ABOUT THE YIELD

01:31:34 BACKDROP AND SPREADS ARE TIGHT BUT YIELDS ARE REALLY

01:31:37 ATTRACTIVE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE POST COVID ERA.

01:31:42 IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR YIELD, IT'S BEEN AN ATTRACTIVE AREA TO

01:31:43 DEPLOY CREDIT. YOU CAN DEPLOY CAPITAL INTO

01:31:47 CREDIT BUT IT'S NOT BEEN RESILIENT ACROSS THE BOARD.

01:31:53 YOU EARLIER WERE TALKING ABOUT CC'S, IT'S TRUE THEY

01:31:55 OUTPERFORMED ON A TOTAL RETURN BASIS BUT THAT'S LARGELY BEEN

01:32:01 DRIVEN BY RATES BECAUSE CCC 'S ARE LESS SENSITIVE.

01:32:06 IF YOU ISOLATE CREDIT SPREADS WHICH I ARGUES A TRUE MEASURE

01:32:10 OF CREDIT RISK,CCC'S HAVE BEEN LAGGING.

01:32:22 IT WOULD SUGGEST THAT TRIPLE S CCC' SHOULDS BE HIGHER.

01:32:24 ON A SPREAD MEASURE WHICH IS ISOLATING THE CREDIT RISK HAS

01:32:27 NOT KEPT PACE WITH THE TIGHTENING OVER ALL WHICH IS

01:32:29 ALSO TRUE IN THE LOAN MARKET. THE MARKET IS EFFICIENT AND

01:32:32 TELL YOU NOT ALL THESE COMPANIES CAN BE HIGHER FOR

01:32:36 LONGER THE SAME WAY. LISA: THERE IS SOME CONCERN ABOUT A

01:32:39 LACK OF CLARITY ABOUT WHAT WHAT THE PATH OF RATES WILL BE AND

01:32:42 HOW PUNITIVE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE FOR COMPANIES.

01:32:46 EARLIER THIS MORNING, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW MICHAEL MCKEE

01:32:51 WILL ASK THE FED UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES CAN YOU IMAGINE

01:32:53 EVER HIKING RATES OR IS THAT OFF THE TABLE?

01:32:57 DO YOU THINK THAT COULD REALLY CAUSE A MASSIVE DISLOCATION IN

01:32:59 CREDIT IF HE ANSWERS YES?

01:33:03 >> TWO THINGS I'M WATCHING FOR TOMORROW AND ONE IS IS THERE AN

01:33:07 ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT WE ARE AT PEAK POLICY RATES?

01:33:11 MAYBE THE CHAIR WANTS TO STEP BACK FROM OVERSTATING THAT.

01:33:17 THE OTHER IS HOW PATIENT THEY WILL BE TO GET DOWN TO THEIR

01:33:19 POLICY OBJECTIVE. HOW ANYMORE MONTHS OF THIS KIND

01:33:24 OF MIDDLE GROUND OF NOT SUSTAINED REAL ACCELERATION BUT

01:33:25 NOT DECLINING INFLATION CAN THEY TOLERATE?

01:33:28 THAT'S WHAT I WATCH FOR TOMORROW.

01:33:31 AS IT RELATES TO CREDIT, IT WILL HAVE IMPLICATIONS BUT I

01:33:35 WOULD EXPECT THAT THEME OF DISPERSION NOT WIDESPREAD

01:33:37 MARKET DISRUPTION TO REMAIN INTACT.

01:33:39 THE INTERESTING POINT SO FAR THIS YEAR IS THAT OVER 30% OF

01:33:48 THE DEFAULTS WE'VE SEEN IN 2023 HAS BEEN REPEAT DEFAULTERS.

01:33:50 THESE ARE COMPANIES THAT HAVE PREVIOUSLY FILED AND THEY ARE

01:33:55 FILING AGAIN OR HAVE PREVIOUSLY COMPETED -- COMPLETED A

01:33:56 DISTRESSED EXCHANGE AND THEY ARE DOING ANOTHER ONE.

01:33:59 A LOT OF THESE COMPANIES UNDER STRESS ARE NOT COMING AS A

01:34:01 SURPRISE TO THE MARKET. SO LONG AS WE HAVE THIS HIGHER

01:34:05 FOR LONGER ENVIRONMENT, WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT IS THE SAME

01:34:11 TROUBLED SECTORS LIKE CAPITAL STRUCTURES THAT WERE KEPT

01:34:14 AFLOAT BY LOW RATES BUT ARE NOT ACTUALLY GROWING IN AN

01:34:16 EFFICIENT WAY WOULD REMAIN UNDER STRESS.

01:34:21 DOES THAT CAUSE BROAD MARKET DISRUPTION?

01:34:24 WHAT COULD CAUSE THAT IS A SUSTAINED REACT JUST

01:34:27 RE-ACCELERATION. LISA: WE WERE SAYING EARLIER THAT

01:34:31 THIS IS NOT MY MOTHER'S HIGH-YIELD MARKET.

01:34:32 THIS HAS CHANGED AND ESSENTIALLY WE ARE LOOKING AT

01:34:34 SOMETHING THAT HAS GROWN UP AND BECOME BETTER POLITY.

01:34:39 HAS THE RISK MIGRATED TO BETTER CREDIT WHERE YOU HAVE A HIGHER

01:34:41 DEGREE OF LESS TESTED COMPANIES? >> I DON'T THINK THE RISK HAS

01:34:44 MIGRATED TO PRIVATE CREDIT. IN SYNDICATED HIGH-YIELD IN

01:34:48 SYNDICATED LEVERAGE LOANS, YOU CAN FIND VULNERABLE COMPANIES

01:34:52 ANYWHERE. WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS AN

01:34:55 OVERLAPPING OF THE ADDRESSABLE MARKET BETWEEN PUBLIC AND

01:34:58 PRIVATE CREDIT WHERE COMPANIES ARE DEMONSTRATED --

01:34:59 DEMONSTRATING ACCESS TO BOTH.

01:35:11 CCC'S, INTEREST COVERAGES ONE.1 TIMES.

01:35:18 FOR MOST OF THE CREDIT MARKET, WE DON'T DEAL WITH A 25 OR 50

01:35:26 POINT RATE CUT AS SIGNIFICANT BUT SOME COMPANIES NEED THAT

01:35:28 AND WHAT THE MARKET IS TELLING YOU IS THAT ON THE MARGIN,

01:35:30 THERE WILL CONTINUE TO BE DISPERSION.

01:35:35 I THINK THERE ARE SOME THEMES LIKE THE REPEAT DEFAULTERS WE

01:35:38 MENTIONED, LOAN ONLY CAPITAL STRUCTURES HAVE BEEN LEADING

01:35:41 THE CHARGE IN TERMS OF DEFAULTS WHICH IS NOT SURPRISING SO

01:35:42 THERE ARE POCKETS OF VULNERABILITY YOU CAN FIND BUT

01:35:46 I DON'T THINK IT'S A WHOLESALE SHIFT IN RISK. JONATHAN:

01:35:51 CAN YOU GIVE US A PERSPECTIVE ON THE ALL IN RISK?

01:35:55 >> ON A PERCENTILE BASIS, USING THE POST FINANCIAL CRISIS TIME,

01:36:00 IT RANKS AROUND THE 80TH OR 90TH PERCENTILE BASED ON THE

01:36:01 REGION AND THE RATING YOU ARE SEEING.

01:36:06 IT'S SAYING THAT 80 OR 90% OF THE TIME, YIELDS HAVE BEEN

01:36:07 LOWER THAN WHERE WE ARE NOW. ON THE SPREAD PERSPECTIVE, IT'S

01:36:11 THE EXACT OPPOSITE WHERE WE ARE KIND OF HOVERING AROUND THE 10

01:36:13 PERCENTILE.

01:36:14 SPREADS HAVE BEEN WIDER-- JONATHAN:

01:36:18 IS IT A GOOD OPPORTUNITY OR NOT? >> THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.

01:36:29 IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO DEPLOY ON AN ALL IN THE YIELD

01:36:32 BASIS BUT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MATERIAL SPREAD TIGHTENING IS

01:36:34 PRETTY LIMITED GIVEN THAT WE ARE AT 299.

01:36:40 THE AVERAGE FOR HIGH-YIELD IS FOR 60. JONATHAN:

01:36:44 DO YOU SEE INVESTORS MIGRATING TO YOUR WORLD?

01:36:52 WE WERE TALKING EARLIER ABOUT ENERGY AND THE OPPORTUNITY WAS

01:36:53 BETTER IN EQUITY THAN IT WAS IN CREDIT.

01:36:56 CAN YOU DESCRIBE A SIMILAR DYNAMIC?

01:36:59 >> ON THE MARGIN WE SEE THE OPPOSITE WHERE WE SEE EQUITY

01:37:05 INVESTORS TAKE SOME CHIPS OFF THE TABLE AFTER SOME STRONG

01:37:08 PERFORMANCE AND DEPLOY IT INTO CREDIT TO LOCK-IN YIELDS.

01:37:11 THE CONVERSATION CAN GO EITHER WAY BUT IT DEPENDS WHAT THE

01:37:13 RISK TOLERANCE IS. JONATHAN: WE APPRECIATE THE DEPTH, THANK

01:37:16 YOU.

01:37:22 THE BIG OPPORTUNITY IN CREDIT AND THE RISK ON THE HORIZON AND

01:37:24 COMPANIES WHO STRUGGLE IF WE DON'T GET THAT RATE CUTTING

01:37:25 CYCLE ANYTIME SOON. LISA:

01:37:31 YOU COULD SEE HIGH-YIELD BOND YIELDS BELOW 4% AFTER 2021.

01:37:35 3.7% IN YIELDS AND NOW THEY ARE 8%.

01:37:40 THAT IS THE YIELD OPPORTUNITY PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT.

01:37:42 JONATHAN: A MASSIVE CHANGE, THE THIRD

01:37:44 HOUR OF BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE IS AROUND THE CORNER.

01:37:54 WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE BIG EARNINGS STORY OF THE WEEK,

01:37:56 AMAZON.

01:38:02 TWO NAMES MAKING UP 10% OF THE S&P 500. ANNMARIE:

01:38:06 SO VIOLENT AFTER ALL OF THE EARNINGS.

01:38:09 THESE ARE $200 BILLION MOVES. JONATHAN:

01:38:15 TRILLION DOLLAR MOVES. TESLA STRUCK A DEAL WITH BAIDU

01:38:19 IN CHINA, 50% HIGHER OFF THE BACK OF THAT. LISA:

01:38:23 I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF SOME OF THESE MOVES OR THE

01:38:24 LEGITIMACY. JONATHAN:

01:38:30 IS 10% THE NEW 1% FOR SOME OF THESE TECH NAMES?

01:38:35 FROM NEW YORK, EQUITIES JUST ABOUT NEGATIVE BY 0.1%.

01:38:38 YOU ARE WATCHING BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE.

01:38:57 >> MAYBE THEY CONTINUE TO CRUSH IT AT EVERY ANGLE.

01:39:01 >> THESE COMPANIES HAVE A TON OF CASH.

01:39:06 >> WHEN YOU HAVE BIRTHRATES ACCELERATE, THEY GET ANXIOUS

01:39:09 THE.

01:39:12 >> THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT.

01:39:17 WEST MAYOR FOCUS ON OTHER THINGS.

01:39:19 WE ARE WILLING TO TRADE RATE CUTS FOR EARNINGS GROWTH.

01:39:24 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE WITH JONATHAN

01:39:25 FERRO, LISA ABRAMOWICZ AND ANNMARIE HORDERN. JONATHAN:

01:39:28 BEGINNING IN 30 MINUTES TIME. IT IS IMPORTANT, JUST NOT THAT

01:39:32 IMPORTANT.

01:39:38 THE INDEX, 8:30 EASTERN TIME.

01:39:44 FAR MORE IMPORTANT TODAY ARE AFTER THE CLOSING BELL.

01:39:50 THE DATA STARTS TO HEAT UP.

01:39:58 ON JOBLESS CLAIMS. LISA: IT WILL BE ABOUT HOW THIS COMES

01:40:04 TOGETHER, WHETHER IT CONFIRMS THE V ACCELERATION INFLATION

01:40:08 THAT WE ARE SEEING AND HOW SUSTAINABLE SOME OF THE

01:40:13 INFLATION WE HAVE SEEN REALLY IS. EMORY:

01:40:16 NORTH OF WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR, WITH JOBS.

01:40:19 AFTER WE HAD MORE THAN 300,000 LAST MONTH.

01:40:23 TEARFULLY, HOW SUSTAINABLE IS THE JOB MARKET?

01:40:27 I'M SO KEYED IN ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS FOR IMMIGRATION IN THIS

01:40:28 COUNTRY. REALLY KEEPING A LID ON INFLATION. JONATHAN:

01:40:35 IT IS THE COMPARE AND CONTRAST OF WHAT IS HAPPENING AT PAYROLL

01:40:40 AND WHAT IS NOT HAPPENING WITH WAGE GROWTH.

01:40:43 EVEN THOUGH WE ARE PRINTING ABOUT 200 EVERY SINGLE MONTH IN

01:40:46 THIS ECONOMY. LISA: THAT IS WHY THE EMPLOYMENT

01:40:50 INDEX COMING OUT IS SO IMPORTANT.

01:40:53 IT IS ONE OF THE KEY METRICS THAT THE FED LOOKS AT.

01:40:58 IT GIVES YOU THE SENSE THAT DISINFLATION WITH EMPLOYMENT

01:40:59 GETS REALLY CHALLENGED. JONATHAN:

01:41:05 IT BEGINS IN 28 MINUTES TIME. NEGATIVE BY 0.1%.

01:41:09 QUITE A REPRICING SO FAR. SOME OF THAT FADES JUST A TOUCH.

01:41:21 BETTER IN MIND THROUGH 470. BIG MOVES IN APRIL. LISA:

01:41:28 WHAT WILL GIVE A SENSE OF WHAT WE CAN REALLY DEPEND ON WHEN

01:41:32 YOU HAVE THESE MASSIVE MOVES AND PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL

01:41:34 INSTRUMENTS.

01:41:40 WE MOVED YESTERDAY ON A REFUNDING ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE

01:41:43 TREASURY DEPARTMENT THAT INCREASED BORROWING MORE THAN

01:41:47 PEOPLE EXPECTED. THE MARKET MOVED ON THAT.

01:41:51 IT GIVES YOU A SENSE THAT PEOPLE ARE SKITTISH. JONATHAN:

01:41:56 WHICH FROG? THAT IS GOOD.

01:42:02 SAYING THAT THEY BEHAVE LIKE SMALL CAPS AND TREASURIES

01:42:07 BEHAVING LIKE PENNY STOCKS. COMING UP, ON TECH EARNINGS

01:42:10 DIVERGENCE.

01:42:17 PREVIEWING OUR EARNINGS.

01:42:23 MORE EARNINGS FROM BIG TECH. I STILL SEE UPSIDE, BUT WE WILL

01:42:28 HAVE TO BE DRIVEN BY EARNINGS GROWTH FROM HERE.

01:42:33 SO FAR THE UPSIDE HAS BEEN NARROW, BUT I EXPECT IT TO

01:42:37 BROADEN OUT AS WE HAVE BETTER PARTICIPATION FROM OTHER

01:42:39 SECTORS BEYOND THE SERVICES. GOOD MORNING.

01:42:46 WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT SEVEN BUT FIVE.

01:42:52 >> APPLE AND TESLA HAVE BEEN A DRAG. IT IS THE FIVE STOCKS.

01:42:56 IF I LOOK AT THE EARNINGS, ALL OF THEIR EARNINGS GROWTH IS

01:42:59 FIVE STOCKS AGAIN, SO WE ARE BACK THAT STORY THAT WE HAD FOR

01:43:04 TWO AND A QUARTER YEARS, WHERE THEY ARE NOT GIVING AS MUCH TO

01:43:07 GET EXCITED ABOUT, BUT I THINK THAT WILL CHANGE AS WE GO

01:43:10 THROUGH THE YEAR. PART OF IT IS, THE ONLY WAY

01:43:15 THAT THIS DEMAND FOR AI AND TECHNOLOGY CAN BE SUSTAINED IS

01:43:19 IF THE CUSTOMERS GET A RETURN ON INVESTMENT.

01:43:22 THEY ARE NOT GOING TO CONTINUE POURING, UNLESS THEY SEE

01:43:24 BENEFITS. HOW QUICKLY DO WE SEE THOSE

01:43:26 BENEFITS? DO THEY SHOW UP?

01:43:32 I'M A LITTLE SKEPTICAL AND HOPEFUL, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,

01:43:34 AS WE LOOK AT THE PROSPECT OF RATE CUTS, NOT JUST RATE

01:43:39 INCREASES, SHIFTING AND STATEMENTS IN THE MARKET.

01:43:43 THE ARE SEEING ONGOING DEMAND THAT HAS SHIFTED AND IT SHOULD

01:43:47 BROADEN EARNINGS GROWTH. LISA: A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TALKING

01:43:51 ABOUT IT. IT GOT PUSHED OUT THREE MONTHS

01:43:58 AND THEN ANOTHER THREE MONTHS. REA IN PURGATORY UNTIL WE GET

01:44:01 THE SENSE THAT THEY ARE GOING TO CUT RATE?

01:44:10 >> I GUESS THIS IS WHERE THE KEY UNDERLYING INFLATION IS.

01:44:13 I FULLY RECOGNIZE THE FIRST QUARTER.

01:44:19 JANUARY, WE THOUGHT, MAYBE IT IS A JANUARY ANOMALY.

01:44:22 FEBRUARY WAS MUCH BETTER ABOUT MARCH WAS CRUSHING IN TERMS OF

01:44:23 OPTIMISM. SERVICE INFLATION IN THE FOURTH

01:44:28 QUARTER TO 8.7 IN THE FIRST QUARTER. 1.6 TO 4.4.

01:44:36 AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE YEAR, YOU WILL IN EASING UPTIGHT.

01:44:45 ONE OF MY FAVORITE ANECDOTES, AUTO INSURANCE HAS BEEN 80

01:44:51 BASIS POINTS OF THE 3.8% CORE CPI. 3.5% OF THE INDEX.

01:44:56 AUTO INSURANCE WILL GO UP FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS BUT NOT AT

01:44:58 WHAT WAS ANALYZED.

01:45:05 LISA: WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE TO SEE AND

01:45:07 SOME OF THE NUMBERS COMING OUT?

01:45:14 GOING TO THE PAYROLLS REPORT ON FRIDAY, BUT WHAT YOU HAVE TO

01:45:15 SEE TO CHANGE YOUR VIEW?

01:45:20 >> WE WANT TO SEE, BACK TO THE DATA, IT IS BEST -- ONE OF THE

01:45:23 BEST METRICS FOR WAGE GROWTH. IT ALSO WORKS BETTER IN TERMS

01:45:28 OF ADJUSTING. IT CAN BE SKEWED.

01:45:36 THAT ONE IS PROBABLY LESS VALUABLE.

01:45:40 BASICALLY ANYWHERE FROM 90 TO 100 BASIS POINTS MEETING.

01:45:46 IT WILL SPOOK THE MARKETS.

01:45:52 QUESTIONABLE IN TERMS OF RELIABILITY. 65 TO 70%.

01:45:59 SOME PEOPLE QUESTION IF THE DATA IS RELIABLE.

01:46:03 I LIKE TO WATCH THE RATE. ARE PEOPLE FINDING BETTER JOBS?

01:46:08 IS ANOTHER ANECDOTE. FRIDAY, LEGALLY AND SEE.

01:46:19 WE NEED 130 TO 140,000 TO KEEP PACE WITH POPULATION GROWTH.

01:46:23 IF WE GET MORE POSITIVE REVISIONS, THAT WILL MAKE ME

01:46:26 MORE NERVOUS. IF I TAKE THIS ALONGSIDE THE

01:46:30 DATA OUTSIDE OF EUROPE THIS MORNING, UPSIDE SURPRISES.

01:46:36 POSITIVE COMMENTARY COMING OUT OF CHINA. THERE IS A RISK OF A V

01:46:40 ACCELERATION. ANNMARIE:

01:46:46 DO YOU THINK EUROPE AND CHINA I CATCHING UP TO THE U.S.

01:46:47 EXCEPTIONALISM THAT IS PETERING OUT?

01:46:51 >> THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE TOO OPTIMISTIC.

01:46:56 IT IS REALLY GREAT, BUT I DO THINK THERE WILL BE IMPROVEMENT.

01:47:01 I THINK THE CASE FOR THE ECB CUTTING RATES IS A LOT STRONGER.

01:47:05 WE ARE NOT DEBATING WHETHER EUROPE IS TO BE ACCELERATING.

01:47:12 IT IS CLEAR THERE GOING FROM ZERO TO SOMETHING LOW ON GROWTH.

01:47:16 I THINK YOU ARE GOING TO GET 100 BASIS POINT RATE CUTS AND

01:47:21 VERY IMPORTANTLY, MONETARY POLICY DECISIONS HAVE A MORE

01:47:24 IMMEDIATE AND UNDEFINED IMPACT THAN THE U.S.

01:47:29 BECAUSE A LOT MORE OF THE HOUSEHOLD DEBT IS FLOATING RATE.

01:47:33 LISA: YOUR BASE CASE IS THAT YOU ARE

01:47:34 GOING TO GET ME CUTS. WHAT IS THE PLAYBOOK, IF YOU

01:47:41 SEE THAT WE ACCELERATION AND INFLATION AND THAT CASE COMES

01:47:46 TO PLAY?

01:47:47 >> I THINK THE FED KEEPS RATES WHERE THEY ARE.

01:47:51 I DO NOT BUY INTO THE HAWKISH THESIS AT ALL.

01:47:55 I THINK IT IS PLENTY TIGHT IN REAL TERMS. AGAIN, I APPRECIATE

01:48:00 THE QUESTION, BUT WHEN I LOOK AT THE DATA, THERE IS ONE PART

01:48:06 WHERE THERE IS A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY.

01:48:07 IF WE LOOK AT THE SHELTER INFLATION, WE KNOW THAT

01:48:11 INFLATION HAS BASICALLY DECLINED SHARPLY AND HAS NOT

01:48:15 SHOWN UP IN THE CPI BUT THERE IS A LAG.

01:48:22 BASED ON ZILLOW, WE KNOW INFLATION HAS GONE FROM 16% TO

01:48:25 LESS THAN 3.6% FOR THE LAST NINE CONSECUTIVE MONTHS.

01:48:29 WE KNOW THAT PART OF INFLATION IS COMING DOWN.

01:48:32 WE KNOW PRICES ARE GOING TO BE SOFT.

01:48:38 WHAT PIECE IT TOGETHER FOR BASICALLY 69% OF CORE CPI, I

01:48:41 KNOW INFLATION IS STAYING LOWER. I HAVE A HARD TIME WITH A

01:48:46 THESIS THAT OVERALL, EXCEL -- INFLATION IS ACCELERATING.

01:48:50 I THINK WE WOULD BE BETTER OFF KISSING ON WHAT IS THE BASE

01:48:56 CASE? THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF PROGRESS.

01:48:59 I THINK IT IS TIME FOR THE FED TO START FOCUSING ON THE OTHER

01:49:00 LEG OF THE MANDATE. THE JOB MARKET IS STRONG, BUT

01:49:06 IF WE COULD HAVE 2.5% UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AND STILL GET

01:49:08 TO THE TARGET, THAT IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT.

01:49:13 JONATHAN: PLENTY OF PROGRESS. PLENTY TIGHT.

01:49:18 HOW MUCH EVIDENCE IS THERE THAT IT IS A SUPPLY-SIDE STORY AND

01:49:22 NOT A DEMAND ONE.

01:49:24 >> I'M GLAD THAT YOU WENT THERE. THE CONSENSUS FOR 2024 IS 2.4%.

01:49:35 2.4% FOR THIS YEAR.

01:49:42 THERE IS A LOT OF OPTIMISM FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH.

01:49:43 BUT THERE ARE SIGNS OF CRACKS. MORTGAGE AND CREDIT CARD

01:49:46 DELINQUENCIES ARE UP. AGAIN, FROM A VERY LOW BASE.

01:49:53 WALL STREET JOURNAL THIS MORNING, THERE WAS ANOTHER

01:49:55
