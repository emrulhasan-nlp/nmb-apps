00:11 >> THE MARKET IS BEING AGGRESSIVE ON RATE CUTS AND I

00:15 BELIEVE THAT THE FED IS GOING TO TAKE IT'S TIME.

00:19 >> BY THE END OF THE YEAR, THEY ARE GOING TO START CUTTING.

00:23 >> OUR FORECAST IS FOUR CUTS.

00:28 >> THAT IS A PIPE DREAM IF WE HAVE A SOFT LANDING.

00:34 >> MARKET IS NOW CALLING FOR A 175 BASIS POINT CUT BY THE FED.

00:36 REALLY? HOW ABOUT THIS? NO WAY AT ALL.

00:41 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE WITH JONATHAN

00:44 FERRO, WE SAW ABRAMOWITZ AND ANTHONY OVERTURN. JONATHAN:

00:49 LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY, GOOD MORNING.

00:52 THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE. YOUR EQUITY MARKET ON THE S&P

00:59 500 POSITIVE BY A THIRD OF 1%. BRAMO, LEAVING BEHIND THE GLOOM

01:03 AND DOOM OF DAVOS. LISA: DOES IT FEEL LIKE RECORD HIGHS?

01:09 IT IS DOWN ON THE YEAR. NVIDIA UP 20%.

01:15 IS THIS JUST NVIDIA DRIVING THE ENTIRE MARKET UP? JONATHAN:

01:17 LET'S TALK ABOUT THE POLITICS. THE GIFT THAT KEEPS ON GIVING

01:20 TO THE NEWS CYCLE. THE REPUBLICAN CYCLE GOES FROM

01:24 THREE TO TWO. LISA: A HEAD-TO-HEAD RACE IN NEW

01:26 HAMPSHIRE. NIKKI HALEY AND FORMER

01:29 PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP.

01:36 IN A FOREIGN A HALF MINUTE VIDEO, RON DESANTIS ENDORSES

01:39 THE FORMER PRESIDENT.

01:46 JONATHAN: CONSUMER CONFIDENCE BOUNCING

01:50 BACK, INFLATION EXPECTATIONS COMING IN. LISA:

01:54 IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT MARKETS, THAT SEEMS TO BE THE

01:57 IMPLICATION AS YOU SEE BONDS LOSING VALUE BUT STOCKS GAINING.

02:01 WE CAN EXIST AT THESE TYPES OF RATES AND COMPANIES CAN STILL

02:02 ACCELERATE AND DO WELL. DOES THIS LAST?

02:07 CAN THIS LAST OR DOES SOMETHING HAVE TO GIVE? JONATHAN:

02:12 LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE FINANCIAL MARKETS.

02:16 EQUITY FUTURES ON THE S&P 500 POSITIVE BY ABOUT A THIRD OF 1%

02:18 ON THE S&P. IN THE BOND MARKET, YIELDS

02:22 COMING IN ON A SINGLE BASIS POINT.

02:28 BRAMO, YIELDS HIGHER ACROSS THE CURVE. LISA:

02:31 THIS COMES AFTER A BUNCH OF PUSHBACK.

02:34 YOU HEARD NO WAY ARE THEY GOING TO CUT RATES BUT AT THIS POINT

02:36 IT IS A GOOD NEWS FOR STOCKS BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU COULD SEE

02:40 BONDS BLOWOUT, YOU COULD SEE STOCKS DO WELL AND THAT SEEMS

02:41 TO BE THE PRESIDING SENTIMENT FOR THE MOMENT.

02:49 JONATHAN: COMING UP ON THIS PROGRAM,

02:50 KICKING OFF THE WEEK WITH EQUITY MARKETS AT ALL-TIME

02:53 HIGHS ON THE S&P 500. IT IS QUIET ON THE EARNINGS

02:58 FRONT BUT IT PICKS UP NEXT WEEK WITH BIG TECH. LISA:

03:04 LATER THIS WEEK, WE GET NETFLIX. I'M CURIOUS TO SEE WHETHER THEY

03:09 CAN REPRISE SOME OF THE -- THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF

03:11 SPLINTERING IN BIG TECH. IS THIS JUST AI AND THEN

03:14 EVERYONE ELSE OR IS THIS GOING TO BE THE MAX SEVEN? JONATHAN:

03:20 DESANTIS DROPPING OUT OF THE 2024 RACE AND ENDORSING TRUMP.

03:24 IS THAT GOOD NEWS FOR TRUMP OR NIKKI HALEY? ANNMARIE:

03:28 I THINK BECAUSE OF THE TIMING, POTENTIALLY IT IS GOOD NEWS FOR

03:31 SOME INDIVIDUALS, FOR NIKKI HALEY BUT THE PROBLEM IS, HE

03:33 WAS PULLING ABOUT 5% IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.

03:38 IS THAT 5% ENOUGH OR NIKKI HALEY BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT

03:41 THE CNN POLL OVER THE WEEKEND WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF NEW

03:45 HAMPSHIRE, TRUMP IS UP 50% IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.

03:47 A LOT OF DONORS ARE GIVING HER THE GRACE PERIOD IN NEW

03:51 HAMPSHIRE BUT AFTER NEW HAMPSHIRE IT IS ALMOST OVER FOR

03:53 HER. JONATHAN: THE UNITED STATES CONTINUING TO

03:55 STRIKE HOUTHI SITES. ARE THEY STOPPING THE HOUTHIS?

04:02 NO. ARE THEY GOING TO CONTINUE? YES. ANNMARIE:

04:10 UNTIL THEY POTENTIALLY GO AFTER SOME HIGHER-LEVEL TARGETS, THE

04:14 HOUTHI'S DO NOT LOOK LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO STOP ANYTIME

04:15 SOON. LISA:

04:21 THIS IS A TORTURED BALANCE TO AVOID SOME KIND OF ALTERCATION.

04:24 WHETHER IT IS A CLEAR STRATEGY, NOT SO MUCH BUT AT THE SAME

04:26 TIME IT IS CLEAR AVERSION TO WANTING A BROADER WAR. JONATHAN:

04:31 OUR NEXT GUEST FROM INVESCO JOINING US IN ABOUT 10 MINUTES.

04:35 TOP STORY, EQUITY MARKETS AT ALL-TIME HIGHS.

04:39 EVERCORE SAYING BE PREPARED FOR THE VOLATILITY OF AN ELECTION

04:42 YEAR, GIVEN THAT A MOMENTUM MARKET COULD KEEP GOING UNTIL

04:47 IT STOPS, WE WANT TO OWN OPTION -- IT IS VERY DIFFICULT NOT TO

04:52 MAKE MONEY WHETHER YOU ARE A BEAR OR A BULL.

04:53 DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN.

04:59 JULIAN MANWELL OF EVERCORE JOINS US RIGHT NOW.

05:03 A BRAND-NEW STUDIO, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

05:05 CAN YOU MAKE MONEY THIS YEAR IN AN ELECTION YEAR AND IGNORE THE

05:08 POLITICS SIMULTANEOUSLY? JULIAN: YOU CAN BUT THE CYCLE WILL NOT

05:15 ALLOW YOU TO IGNORE THE POLITICS BUT FROM OUR

05:18 PERSPECTIVE, IF YOU LOOK AT THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS, YOU HAVE

05:21 WHAT YOU HAD ONCE AGAIN. ACT TOWARDS THE SUMMER OF LAST

05:30 YEAR, THE MOMENTUM TRADE REALLY DOMINATING AND GENERATIVE AI,

05:37 WHICH WE BELIEVE IS A LONG-TERM VIABLE THEME, EMBRACED NOT ONLY

05:39 IN CORPORATE AMERICA BUT ACROSS THE ENTIRE WORLD AS THE

05:41 PRODUCTIVITY ENHANCER. EVERY NOW AND AGAIN, THINGS GET

05:47 AHEAD OF THEMSELVES AND TO US, THIS IS ONE OF THOSE TIMES

05:50 WHERE THE TEASERS TALKED ABOUT TOO MANY RATE CUTS BEING PRICED

05:55 IN.

05:56 TOO MUCH EARNINGS ANTICIPATION BEING PRICED IN AND ALL OF

05:58 THOSE ARE LIKELY GOING TO CAUSE A BIT OF A PAUSE. LISA:

06:01 YOU PUT A NUMBER ON THAT. A 10% DECLINE OF POTENTIAL

06:05 CORRECTION. WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THAT IF YOU

06:11 ARE BULLISH LONG-TERM OR BEARISH , SAYING I'M STILL

06:12 GOING TO MAKE MONEY? HOW DO YOU MAKE MONEY IF YOU

06:15 ARE EXPECTING A CORRECTION? JULIAN:

06:21 OPTION HEDGES ARE EXTREMELY INEXPENSIVE, GIVEN THE ONLY THE

06:23 VOLATILITY WE HAVE SEEN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS BUT THE

06:25 VOLATILITY THAT IS TYPICAL OF THIS KIND OF YEAR, WHEN THE

06:28 BALANCE OF POWER COMING INTO THE ELECTION YEAR IS AS TIGHT

06:31 AS IT IS. THIS IS THE TYPE OF

06:37 CONVERSATION WE ARE HAVING WITH CLIENTS, IT'S LESS ABOUT THE

06:43 DEFENSIVE ASPECT AND MORE ABOUT STAYING INVESTED IN THEMES THAT

06:48 ARE LIKELY TO WORK AND TO US, THAT IS COMMUNICATION SERVICES,

06:51 HEALTH CARE, CONSUMER STAPLES, IN ANTICIPATION OF A MORE

06:57 ADVANTAGEOUS TIME TO DEPLOY CAPITAL, WHICH WE THINK COMES

06:58 LATER IN THE YEAR. ANNMARIE: DO YOU THINK WHAT WE HAVE SEEN

07:02 WITH BONDS UNDERPERFORMING AND STOCKS OUTPERFORMING CAN

07:05 CONTINUE OVER A LONGER TERM? OR DO YOU THINK THIS IS THE

07:10 BEGINNING OF THAT RESET, THAT WE WILL SEE THAT CORRECTION?

07:13 JULIAN: WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE NINE.

07:17 -- THE 1990'S. THERE WAS A LOT OF MONEY MADE

07:20 IN STOCKS. WITH YIELDS AND INTEREST RATES

07:24 AT THESE LEVELS. IT IS LESS ABOUT ARE WE GOING

07:31 TO REVISIT 5% AGAIN, THAT IS

07:37 NOT LIKELY GIVEN THE ECONOMY AT MIDYEAR, BUT FRANKLY IF THE

07:42 VOLATILITY IN THE INTEREST RATE MARKETS COMES DOWN, THAT IS A

07:47 BETTER SIGN FOR AN EQUITY INVESTOR IN TERMS OF

07:48 UNDERSTANDING RISK REWARD. JONATHAN:

07:53 WHAT CAN SHAKE THE NOTHING CAN GO WRONG OPTIMISM?

07:56 RETAIL SALES CAME IN HOT. JOBLESS CLAIMS CAME IN MUCH

07:59 LOWER. YOU LOOK AT CONSUMER CONFIDENCE

08:03 PICKING UP AND INFLATION EXPECTATIONS FALLING.

08:06 ISN'T EVERYTHING GOING RIGHT TO START THE YEAR? JULIAN:

08:11 THERE ARE ONLY A COUPLE ANCILLARY POINTS.

08:16 A MANUFACTURING SURVEY, IT WAS QUITE WEEK.

08:20 SERVICES VERGING TOWARD THAT 50, BUT FRANKLY THE CONCEPT OF

08:23 A SLOWDOWN, THE NON-SOFT LANDING IS STILL ON THE SHELF

08:28 ARE NOW. JONATHAN: YOU GOT TO THE ESSENCE OF IT.

08:32 LAST WEEK WAS A CLEAN SWEEP. THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS, YOU

08:35 SEE SOME CONFLICT. HOW MUCH OF THE ECONOMIC DATA

08:40 DO YOU LOOK AT? IS IT CONFLICT? JULIAN: IT IS A SMALL BUT SLOWLY

08:44 BUILDING NUMBER.

08:50 EVERCORE ISI'S PROPRIETARY CORPORATE SURVEYS HAVE STARTED

08:54 TO SHOW A LITTLE BIT OF WEAKNESS, THAT THERE WAS SOME

08:58 STABILITY IN AND AROUND THE HOLIDAY SEASON WHICH IS WHY I

09:03 THINK A LOT OF THESE CONFIDENCE MEASURES ARE REALLY SORT OF

09:06 COMING OFF OF THE HOLIDAY SEASON AND LET'S SEE HOW THAT

09:08 EVOLVES INTO FEBRUARY. LISA: YOU TALK ABOUT VOLATILITY BUT

09:12 YOU ARE ALSO OVERWEIGHT DEFENSE STOCKS.

09:17 WOULD THAT CHANGE IF YOU SEE TRUMP BACK IN POWER TAKING A

09:18 MORE ISOLATIONIST APPROACH? JULIAN:

09:24 I THINK THERE IS A BIT OF A CONFLICT, IN TERMS OF HOW THE

09:26 SECTORS ARE LIKELY TO PERFORM. IF YOU LOOK AT THE LAST TWO

09:33 ELECTION CYCLES, THERE WAS A DEEP RATIFICATION OF THE MORE

09:37 INDUSTRIAL TYPE STOCKS AND SECTORS, BUT ACTUALLY WHEN YOU

09:41 THINK ABOUT THIS YEAR, AGAIN WE GO BACK TO THIS IDEA THAT WHAT

09:44 IS DRIVING THE MARKET RIGHT NOW IS VERY MUCH CONCENTRATED

09:49 AROUND AI, AND THE WAY WE KNOW THAT IS IF YOU LOOK YEAR TO

09:52 DATE, THE MORE ECONOMICALLY SENSITIVE SECTORS, CONSUMER

09:58 DISCRETIONARY, INDUSTRIALS, MATERIALS, ALL DOWN ON THE YEAR.

10:00 ANNMARIE: SO REGARDLESS OF WHO WINS, AI

10:03 IS THE WINTER. JULIAN: WE THINK SO, BUT THIS IS ONE OF

10:08 THOSE TIMES WHERE THESE THINGS GO IN EBBS AND FLOWS.

10:13 I'M REMINDED OF THE MIDDLE OF 1999 WHEN THE NASDAQ PULLED

10:19 BACK ABOUT 14% ON ITS WAY TO 100% AND A STOCK WHICH HAS

10:24 BECOME THE WORLD'S MOST ICONIC STOCK PULLED IN 29% TO A SPLIT

10:28 ADJUSTED PRICE OF $.50 VERSUS ITS CURRENT LEVEL OF $190 A

10:30 SHARE. YOU HAVE TO THINK LONG TERM AND

10:35 BE ABLE TO RIDE OUT VOLATILITY. JONATHAN:

10:37 GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US. GOING TO HAVE YOU WITH US.

10:45 EVERYONE CAN -- WITH THE TRAJECTORY OF THAT TECHNOLOGY.

10:48 LISA: BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO TAKE

10:52 OVER OUR JOBS AND UNDERMINE THE WORLD POTENTIALLY? JONATHAN:

10:57 IT HAS THE REAL POTENTIAL TO DO WHAT SERVICES -- TO DO TO

10:59 SERVICES WHAT GLOBALIZATION DID TO MANUFACTURING.

11:01 WE COULDN'T TRUST GOVERNMENT LAST TIME AROUND. LISA:

11:06 MICHAEL PUSHED BACK ON THE A LITTLE BIT.

11:11 PEOPLE IN MY FAMILY SAYING IS NOT GOING TO BE ARMAGEDDON FOR

11:14 OLDER PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR? A LOT OF PEOPLE PUSHED BACK ON

11:19 THAT. WHERE IS THE TRUST? ANNMARIE:

11:22 WHEN I SAY THIS TO INDIVIDUALS, THEY SAY WE ARE NOT TRAINED TO

11:24 PUT YOU OUT OF BUSINESS, WE ARE TRYING TO ENHANCE YOUR JOB,

11:27 MAKING IT EASIER TO DO YOUR JOB. BUT IT IS CONCERNING. JONATHAN:

11:32 BEFORE WE SEE COMPUTERIZED ANNMARIE HORTON IN THE CONTROL

11:37 ROOM -- ANNMARIE HORDEN IN THE CONTROL ROOM.

11:40 LET'S CATCH UP WITH DANI BURGER. DANI: GOOD MORNING.

11:46 FOR THE GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS HAS DROPPED OUT OF THE 2024

11:47 PRESIDENTIAL RACE ON SUNDAY. NOW HE IS ENDORSING DONALD

11:49 TRUMP. HE EXITS THE RACE JUST TWO DAYS

11:53 BEFORE THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY. FORMER U.N.

11:56 AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY IS NOW THE SECOND-PLACE CANDIDATE.

12:00 THE LATEST POLLING SHOWS TRUMP LEADING NEW HAMPSHIRE WITH 50%.

12:03 NIKKI HALEY IS AT 39%. MACY'S HAS REJECTED A TURKEY --

12:08 A TAKEOVER FROM INVESTORS ART-HOUSE MANAGEMENT.

12:13 THE OFFER INITIALLY MADE LAST MONTH REPRESENTS A 19% PREMIUM

12:15 TO MACY'S CLOSING PRICE ON FRIDAY.

12:19 THE MACY'S BOARD DECLINED TO PROVIDE TO DILIGENCE.

12:24 SPIRIT AIRLINES SAYS IT'S DEAL WITH JETBLUE REMAINS QUOTE, IN

12:31 FULL FORCE IN EFFECT AS A CARRY -- AS THE CARRIER LOOKS UP --

12:33 LOOKS FOR WAYS TO SHORE UP ITS LIQUIDITY.

12:37 THEY LOOK TO REFINANCE THEIR DEBT AS AN EFFORT TO REDUCE

12:40 ANXIETIES OVER THE MERGER FALLOUT.

12:47 THAT IS YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF. JONATHAN: APPRECIATE THE UPDATE.

12:54 UP NEXT, DESANTIS DROPPING OUT, ENDORSING DONALD TRUMP.

12:58 >> HERE I AM TODAY, SUSPENDING MY CAMPAIGN.

13:01 I'M PROUD TO HAVE DELIVERED ON 100% OF MY PROMISES.

13:02 I WILL NOT STOP NOW. JONATHAN: THAT IS COMING UP NEXT.

13:08 YOU ARE WATCHING BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE. ♪

13:59 JONATHAN: LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY, GOOD

14:00 MORNING. A QUICK CHECK OF THE PRICE

14:02 ACTION. EQUITY FUTURES POSITIVE BY A

14:05 THIRD OF 1%. YIELDS LOWER, DOWN 2%.

14:12 UNDER SURVEILLANCE THIS MORNING, DESANTIS DROPPING OUT,

14:13 ENDORSING DONALD TRUMP.

14:17 >> I AM TODAY SUSPENDING MY CAMPAIGN.

14:20 I'M PROUD TO HAVE DELIVERED ON 100% OF MY PROMISES AND I WILL

14:23 NOT STOP NOW. IT IS CLEAR TO ME THAT A

14:27 MAJORITY OF REPUBLICAN PRIMARY VOTERS WANT TO GIVE DONALD

14:28 TRUMP ANOTHER CHANCE. I SIGNED A PLEDGE TO SUPPORT

14:32 THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE, AND I WILL HONOR THAT PLEDGE.

14:35 HE HAS MY ENDORSEMENT BECAUSE WE CAN'T GO BACK TO THE OLD

14:38 REPUBLICAN GUARD OF YESTERYEAR. JONATHAN:

14:42 THE RACE FOR THE GOP NOMINATION DOWN TO TWO AHEAD OF THE NEW

14:43 HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY. THE LATEST POLLS SHOW DONALD

14:46 TRUMP WIDENING HIS LEAD. NIKKI HALEY INTENSIFYING HER

14:54 ATTACK ON THE FORMER PRESIDENT, SAYING QUOTE, WE ARE SEEING HE

14:56 IS NOT THE SAME LEVEL HE WASN'T 2016. LISA:

14:59 PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT VIDEO OF HIM OVER THE WEEKEND

15:02 WHEN HE KEPT TALKING ABOUT NIKKI HALEY BUT HE MEANT NANCY

15:03 PELOSI. EVERYONE IS WEIGHING IN ON RON

15:06 DESANTIS DROPPING OUT. THE WASHINGTON POST SAYING DOES

15:10 MR. DESANTIS HAVE A PRESIDENT OF FUTURE?

15:15 HE HAS AN EXCELLENT RECORD IN FLORIDA.

15:17 REPUBLICANS GAMBLE ON MR. TRUMP ONCE AGAIN.

15:20 WIN OR LOSE, HE CAN'T RUN AGAIN. MAYBE THEN, MR. DESANTIS WILL

15:28 OFFER A CONSERVATIVE STANCE THAT OFFERS MORE THAN SECOND

15:29 STRING TRUMPISM. JONATHAN: THIS CAMPAIGN STARTED

15:33 ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLY. AND NEVER JUST PICKED UP DID IT?

15:39 LISA: THERE WERE ARE ALL OF THESE

15:41 SORT OF POSTMORTEMS TALKING ABOUT INFIGHTING AND FINANCIAL

15:44 PROBLEMS AND THE LACK OF DIRECTION.

15:47 NOT TO MENTION HOW DO YOU FIGHT BACK AGAINST SOMEONE YOU ASPIRE

15:48 TO BE? ALTHOUGH WE CAN SAY IS NOW THE

15:53 QUESTION IS, IS HE ON VICE PRESIDENT WATCH?

15:54 DOES THIS HELP NIKKI HALEY OR DOES IT HELP THE FORMER

15:56 PRESIDENT MORE? JONATHAN: LET'S HAVE THE CONVERSATION

15:59 RIGHT NOW. JOINING US IS THE HEAD OF U.S.

16:03 GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS AT INVESCO. GREAT TO CATCH UP WITH YOU.

16:09 LET'S START WITH IF NIKKI HALEY CAN CLOSE THE GAP. JENNIFER:

16:13 IT IS NOT LOOKING GOOD. THOSE POLLS YOU WERE

16:16 REFERENCING SHOWING THAT MOST OF THOSE VOTES ARE PROBABLY

16:20 GOING TO GO TO TRUMP FROM DESANTIS.

16:25 THAT DOUBLE-DIGIT LEAD TRUMP HAS GOING INTO NEW HAMPSHIRE,

16:30 THE MOMENTUM IS BEHIND HIM AND IT'S GOING TO BE POTENTIALLY A

16:34 DIFFICULT DECISION AFTER NEW HAMPSHIRE IF HALEY DOESN'T GET

16:36 WITHIN AT LEAST FIVE POINTS OF TRUMP. ANNMARIE:

16:41 SO WHEN DOES SHE DROP OUT IF TRUMP DOES TAKE NEW HAMPSHIRE?

16:42 JENNIFER: THAT IS THE QUESTION, BECAUSE

16:50 IT HAS BEEN A MONTH -- IT IS A MONTH UNTIL SOUTH CAROLINA AND

16:54 WE HAVE NEVADA IN BETWEEN BUT THERE ELECTION WITH THE PRIMARY

16:56 VERSUS A CAUCUS HAS PUT THEM OFF TO THE SIDE.

17:00 ON FEBRUARY 24, YOU HAVE SOUTH CAROLINA.

17:04 IF SHE COMES WITHIN FIVE POINTS OF TRUMP TOMORROW, SHE COULD

17:06 HAVE SOME MOMENTUM, SOME REAL WIND TO HER BACK AND NECK COULD

17:10 KEEP THE MONEY FLOWING, WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT GOING INTO

17:12 SOUTH CAROLINA.

17:20 IF HER NUMBERS CONTINUE TO SHOW THAT SOUTH CAROLINA ISN'T

17:22 REALLY IN PLAY FOR HER, I COULD BE EMBARRASSING, SO SHE WILL

17:25 HAVE TO TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT WHEN MAKING HER FINAL DECISION.

17:29 ANNMARIE: DOES SHE EVEN GO FOR SOUTH

17:33 CAROLINA IF THE POLLS WERE TO REMAIN IN HER FAVOR AND SENATOR

17:38 TIM SCOTT DECIDED TO ENDORSE THE FORMER PRESIDENT?

17:40 SHE IS LOSING THAT STATE AT THE MOMENT BY MORE THAN 20 POINTS.

17:45 IS IT SAFER FOR HER TO BACK OUT BEFORE SHE HAS THIS

17:47 EMBARRASSMENT IN HER HOME STATE? JENNIFER:

17:48 YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD. CONSERVATIVES IN SOUTH CAROLINA

17:53 AND NEW HAMPSHIRE IS MUCH MORE INDEPENDENT.

17:56 WHEN YOU GO INTO SOUTH CAROLINA, YOU ARE LOOKING AT A

17:58 MORE TRADITIONAL REPUBLICAN BASE.

18:02 HER NUMBERS ARE NOT AS GOOD IN SOUTH CAROLINA AS THEY ARE IN

18:03 NEW HAMPSHIRE. YOU MENTIONED TIM SCOTT

18:06 ENDORSING DONALD TRUMP. ALSO IT IS THE GOVERNOR OF

18:10 SOUTH CAROLINA ENDORSING DONALD TRUMP, AND MOST OF THE MEMBERS

18:15 OF CONGRESS. ONLY ONE ENDORSED HER.

18:18 YOU HAVE A REAL MOMENTUM FOR DONALD TRUMP IN SOUTH CAROLINA.

18:21 LISA: IS RON DESANTIS GUNNING TO BE

18:23 VICE PRESIDENT? JENNIFER: I DON'T THINK SO.

18:30 I THINK RON DESANTIS IS LOOKING TO 2028 AND THE KEY IS YOUNG,

18:36 45 YEARS OLD AND HE SEES A POLITICAL FUTURE FOR HIMSELF

18:37 BUT I DOUBT IT IS RUNNING ALONGSIDE DONALD TRUMP. LISA:

18:41 MEANWHILE, THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT HAVE TO GET DONE

18:43 LIKE PASSING A BUDGET AND DEALING WITH NATIONAL SECURITY

18:45 CONCERNS. THERE SEEMS TO BE A BIT OF A

18:47 STALEMATE. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE

18:53 CHANCES OF GETTING A BILL PASSED THIS MONTH, BUT THAT CAN

18:58 ALSO CARRY THROUGH TO MARCH, SO WE DON'T END UP WITH THIS ON

19:03 REPEAT AGAIN AND AGAIN WITH MORE ACRIMONY EACH TIME?

19:06 JENNIFER: THEY WERE ABLE TO PASS A CR

19:09 MARCH 1 AND THEN MARCH 8. STAGGERING THOSE APPROPRIATIONS

19:13 BILLS. SCHUMER AND JOHNSON WERE ABLE

19:17 TO REACH A DEAL ON A TOPLINE SPENDING NUMBER.

19:21 BUT THEY STILL NEED TO GET THOSE -- NUMBERS THAT ARE THE

19:27 THRESHOLDS FOR EACH OF THE INDIVIDUAL 12.

19:31 APPROPRIATIONS BILLS THAT IS GOING TO BE ON THE SHOULDERS OF

19:34 THE APPROPRIATORS IN ORDER TO REACH THAT MARCH 1 AND MARCH 8

19:35 DEADLINE. JONATHAN: I WANT TO TURN TO WHAT IS

19:40 HAPPENING INTERNATIONALLY AND FINISH ON THE STRIKES ON THE

19:44 HOUTHI'S IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED ABOUT

19:46 THE STRIKES OVER THE WEEKEND AND HE GAVE AN ALMOST BIZARRE

19:48 RESPONSE AND HE SAID THE QUIET BIT OUT LOUD.

19:50 ARE THEY STOPPING THEM? NO. ARE THEY GOING TO CONTINUE? YES.

19:55 WHY WOULD THEY CONTINUE IF THEY ARE NOT WORKING? JENNIFER:

19:59 YOU ARE SEEING A REACTION FROM CONGRESS WITH THE SAME SORT OF

20:01 QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW. HE IS GETTING HIT FROM

20:08 REPUBLICANS, NATIONAL DEFENSE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE REAL

20:10 DEFENSE HAWKS AND WONDERING WHY THE INCREMENTAL APPROACH TO

20:13 WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THAT WILL ONLY INCREASE

20:19 AND I THINK YOU ARE GOING TO SEE A NUMBER OF HEARINGS AND A

20:22 LOT OF FOCUS AND SPOTLIGHT FROM THOSE COMMITTEES WHEN THE HOUSE

20:26 RETURNS AFTER NEXT WEEK. JONATHAN: APPRECIATE THE UPDATE.

20:35 STILL WITH US AROUND THE TAIL, -- AROUND THE TABLE, JULIAN

20:37 EMANUEL OF EVERCORE. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE

20:40 CONSEQUENCES. WE HAVE TRAFFIC TO THE RED SEA

20:44 DOWN, TRAFFIC THROUGH THE PANAMA CANAL DOWN.

20:47 HOW CLOSE ARE WE TO GOODS INFLATION PICKING UP AGAIN

20:51 BECAUSE IT WAS HAPPENING AROUND THE WORLD?

20:53 -- BECAUSE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING AROUND THE WORLD? JULIAN:

20:57 THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT BOTHERS US ABOUT BEING

20:59 ULTRA-AGGRESSIVE TO THE UPSIDE IN THE MARKETS, IS THAT PART OF

21:05 THIS EXPECTATION IS THAT INFLATION IS GOING TO CONTINUE

21:08 THAT GENTLE GLIDE PATH LOWER AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WHAT

21:13 YOU MAY END UP SEEING IS IF YOU HAVE CONTINUED CONGESTION, THIS

21:17 COULD BE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE STICKINESS DOES REMAIN, BUT

21:24 IN FACT IT DOES END UP BEING MANIFESTED IN INCREMENTALLY

21:27 LOWER DEMAND, PARTICULARLY GIVEN THAT FROM OUR POINT OF

21:30 VIEW, YOU ARE LIKELY TO HAVE THE END OF THE PANDEMIC ECESS

21:39 SAVING -- EXCESS SAVINGS SOMETIME THIS YEAR. LISA:

21:43 COULD YOU TALK ABOUT THE DOWNTURN YOU ARE LOOKING AT?

21:44 JULIAN: THE BIGGEST WOULD BE AN INTERPRETATION RIGHT NOW, AS

21:51 FAR AS NEWS AMONGST THE GENERATIVE AI NAMES.

21:56 IF YOU SEE EARNINGS, AND EARNINGS HAS BEEN A PUZZLEMENT

22:00 THUS FAR, OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE HAD MIXED RESULTS.

22:04 IT LOOKS LIKE THIS IS SHAPING UP TO BE NOT SO GREAT OF A

22:05 QUARTER. WHAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT IS

22:11 AGAIN, AS MUCH OF THE LAST YEAR, HOW THE STOXX REACT

22:14 TOWARDS THE EARNINGS NUMBERS -- HOW THE STOCKS REACT TO THE

22:19 EARNINGS NUMBERS, GIVEN THAT THERE IS MUCH MORE UPSIDE.

22:22 ANNMARIE:

22:29 AT THIS MOMENT, ISN'T SOMEONE'S BOTTOM LINE BEING HIT BY THE

22:32 FACT THAT THE SHIPS HAVE TO TAKE A LONGER AND MORE

22:33 EXPENSIVE ROUTE AROUND AFRICA? JULIAN: NO QUESTION.

22:38 IF YOU THINK ABOUT THOSE KINDS OF DISTORTIONS IN THE PANDEMIC,

22:41 YOU STILL HAD THE DEMAND BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING

22:43 ELSE TO SPEND OUR MONEY ON. FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE, WE ARE

22:47 JUST IN A DIFFERENT STATE OF AFFAIRS.

22:49 THERE COULD BE THE STICKINESS TO INFLATION, MAKES THE FED'S

22:55 INTENDED PATH A BIT MORE TRYING BUT ULTIMATELY IT COULD WIND

23:00 DOWN INTO SLIGHTLY DIMINISHED DEMAND. JONATHAN:

23:04 FAVORITE TRADE THIS YEAR? JULIAN:

23:10 WE REALLY LIKE THE NAMES AND IT'S ACROSS A VARIETY OF

23:13 INDUSTRIES THAT ARE TAKING GENERATIVE AI AND ASKS JULIE --

23:17 AND ACTUALLY FIGURING OUT HOW TO MAKE IT WORK.

23:25 WHEN YOU THICK ABOUT FINANCIAL INDUSTRY COMMENTARY, THEY ARE

23:27 THE VANGUARD OF THE COST SAVINGS IN THIS ENVIRONMENT,

23:31 BUT IT IS ALSO THE CONSUMER COMPANIES WHO ARE BECOMING MUCH

23:34 MORE ADEPT AT CONNECTING THEIR CLIENTS, TAKING INFORMATION AND

23:38 IMPORTANTLY, ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS TO MAKE IT ALL WORK.

23:42 JONATHAN: THANKS FOR THE INSIGHT THIS

23:47 MORNING. JULIAN EMMANUELLE OF EVERCORE.

23:51 ABOUT THREE HOURS AWAY FROM THE OPENING BELL.

23:55 S&P 500 PUSHING UP A LITTLE FURTHER AFTER CLOSING AT

23:57 ALL-TIME HIGHS ON FRIDAY'S SESSION.

23:59 TWO WEEKS OF GAINS ON THE S&P. CAN WE ADD TO IT?

24:04 COMING UP IN ABOUT 20 MINUTES, WE WILL CATCH UP WITH STEPHEN

24:06 MAJOR OF HSBC ON THE GLOBAL FIXED INCOME MARKET AS WE WAIT

24:10 FOR THIS WEEK'S ECB RATE DECISION.

24:14 IF FEELS LIKE WE'VE HAD TWO CONFERENCES ALREADY. LISA:

24:17 CHRISTINE LAGARDE GAVE A PREVIEW AND HAD SOME SPICY

24:21 WORDS ABOUT TRUMP. JONATHAN: ABOUT THREE OR FOUR PRESS

24:25 CONFERENCES WITH CHRISTINE LAGARDE IN DAVOS.

24:30 FROM NEW YORK CITY, YOU ARE WATCHING BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE.

24:45 JONATHAN: LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY, GOOD

24:46 MORNING. TWO WEEKS OF GAINS ON THE S&P

24:51 500, LOOKING TO KICK OFF A THIRD WEEK OF GAINS POTENTIALLY.

24:55 THE S&P POSITIVE BY A THIRD OF 1%. THE NASDAQ UP BY 0.6%.

25:00 THE RUSSELL PICKING UP BY 0.4%.

25:06 ATTENTION TURNING AWAY FROM FINANCIALS, TOWARDS WHAT WE

25:07 HAVE FROM BIG TECH OVER THE WEEK OR SO. APPLE ON DECK. LISA:

25:13 AND BEFORE THAT WE WILL GET 10 LAND NETFLIX.

25:17 -- TESLA AND NETFLIX. ANY KIND OF GAINS HAVE BEEN

25:22 ENTIRELY FROM THESE STOCKS AND IT IS SHOCKING TO SEE THE

25:25 RUSSELL 2000 STILL IN A BEAR MARKET AS YOU SEE NEW RECORD

25:26 HIGHS FOR THE S&P 500. JONATHAN: AMAZING TO SEE ALL-TIME NEW

25:30 HIGHS ON THE S&P 500.

25:38 THE TWO-YEAR CURRENTLY, 43825. LAST WEEK, WE HAD PUSHBACK FROM

25:46 GOVERNOR WALLER AGAINST RECUT TALK.

25:49 CONSUMER OPTIMISM PICKING UP. A LOT OF REASONS FOR HIGH

25:52 YIELDS LAST WEEK. LISA: THIS ALL CAME FROM THE STRIKE

25:56 SUPPORTING EQUITY MARKETS.

25:58 THIS WAS THE BEGINNING OF STOCKS AND BONDS HAVING INVERSE

26:02 RELATIONSHIP AND IT'S GOING BACK TO NORMAL AND YOU CAN HAVE

26:03 A BALANCED PORTFOLIO. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK OF

26:08 THAT BECAUSE THIS SEEMS LIKE A SWEET SPOT THAT COULD PUSH

26:10 EITHER DIRECTION PRETTY QUICKLY. JONATHAN:

26:14 WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT EUROPE AS WELL, THE DATA NOT GREAT AT ALL.

26:17 THE EURO LOOKS LIKE THIS AGAINST THE DOLLAR.

26:20 THE EURODOLLAR 1.08. WE JOKED ABOUT HOW MANY TIMES

26:25 WE HEARD FROM THE ECB PRESIDENT LAST WEEK IN DAVOS.

26:29 NOT ENTERTAINING THE RATE CUTS BY QUITE THE SAME CUT -- QUITE

26:32 THE SAME RATE THAT THE MARKET SEEMS TO BE. LISA:

26:37 WILL SHE PUSH THAT FORWARD GIVEN THE FACT THAT YOU DO HAVE

26:39 DISINFLATION AND YOU DO HAVE A BIT OF SOFT THIS, PARTICULARLY

26:42 IN GERMANY? WE WILL HEAR FROM HER AGAIN IN

26:45 THE FIFTH PRESS CONFERENCE ON THURSDAY.

26:51 JONATHAN: AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS JUST

26:52 AROUND THE CORNER AS WELL. FOR THE GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS

26:58 DROPPING OUT OF THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL RACE AND ENDORSING

26:59 FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. DESANTIS LEAVING THE CAMPAIGN

27:03 TRAIL JUST BEFORE VOTERS TAKE TO THE POLLS FOR THE NEW

27:04 HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY TOMORROW. THE STAGE IS NOW SET FOR A TWO

27:10 WAY RACE BETWEEN TRUMP AND THE FORMER, NIKKI HALEY. ANNMARIE:

27:13 DESANTIS DROPPING OUT. I SPOKE TO SOME FROM HIS

27:17 CAMPAIGN AND THEY SAID THERE WAS JUST NO PATH FORWARD.

27:21 NOW EVERYONE YOU MENTIONED IS DOING THESE POSTMORTEMS BUT HE

27:23 PEAKED BEFORE HE ENTERED. HE WAS LEADING TRUMP THIS TIME

27:27 LAST YEAR. THEN HE HAD THAT BAD RELEASE ON

27:33 TWITTER AND FROM THEN IT HAS BEEN ALL DOWNHILL. LISA:

27:37 HE WANTED TO SAY HE BROKE THE INTERNET AND EVERYONE JUST SAID

27:38 HE BROKE. NIKKI HALEY HAS NOW SAID MAY

27:43 THE BEST WOMAN WIN. I'M CURIOUS WHAT IS THE

27:47 THRESHOLD FOR A DROP OUT BECAUSE IT DOES NOT SEEM LIKE

27:48 THERE IS A REAL PATH. HOW BIG DOES THE GAP HAVE TO BE

27:53 WHEN TRUMP WINS AND HOW BIG IS HER LOSS HAVE TO BE?

27:55 THAT'LL BE ACHY MILLION ASIAN. ANNMARIE:

27:58 DOES SHE MAKE IT TO SOUTH CAROLINA? JONATHAN:

28:00 DO THINK THERE WAS A CHANCE SHE WON'T? ANNMARIE:

28:05 IT'LL BE QUITE HUMILIATING IF SHE LOSES HER HOME STATE, WHERE

28:07 SHE USED TO BE GOVERNOR. JONATHAN:

28:08 WHAT IS THE LEAD RIGHT NOW? . ANNMARIE: IT IS NOT GOOD.

28:12 TRUMP LEADING IN DOUBLE DIGITS. TWO OUR EARLIER GUEST'S POINT,

28:17 IT IS NOT JUST SENATOR TIM SCOTT WHO HAS COME OUT TO

28:21 ENDORSE FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP.

28:23 IT IS THE CURRENT GOVERNOR. SHE IS UP AGAINST A TOUGH FIGHT

28:27 IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND MAYBE SHE WANTS TO SAVE HERSELF FROM THAT

28:28 EMBARRASSMENT. LISA: THE REASON WHY NEW HAMPSHIRE IS

28:32 INTERESTING IS BECAUSE INDEPENDENTS CAN VOTE.

28:37 MAYBE SHE IS TRYING TO POSE THE BEST OPPOSITION TO JOE BIDEN

28:38 AND MAYBE SHE CAN MAKE THAT PITCH IN A NEW KIND OF WAY.

28:41 JONATHAN: THE LATEST UPDATE IN THE MIDDLE

28:45 EAST. IS REALLY PRIME AND DISTURBING TO HIM AND THAT NOW

28:48 HE REJECTING A DEAL TO RELEASE MORE HOSTAGES IN GAZA.

28:51 THE HOUSE IS DEMANDING A WITHDRAWAL OF ALL FORCES IN

28:54 GAZA. PRESSURE RAMPING UP FOR A DEAL

28:59 TO BRING THE REMAINING 132 HOSTAGES HOME.

29:02 RAMPING UP TO MYSTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY AS WELL. LISA:

29:07 WHAT STRIKES ME AS COMPELLING AS THIS IDEA THAT THE ISRAELI

29:09 FOREIGN MINISTER IS OVER IN EUROPE MAKING THEIR PITCH AND

29:12 EUROPE IS HAVING SOME HARSH WORDS WITH ISRAEL, SAYING IF

29:15 YOU ARE NOT ON BOARD WITH A TWO STATE SOLUTION, WE CAN'T HELP

29:19 YOU. BIDEN SPLINTERING FROM NETANYAHU, AT THE SAME TIME HE

29:21 IS LOSING A LOT OF POPULARITY. THERE IS A LOT OF INTERNAL PUSH

29:27 FOR ELECTIONS THAT COULD KICK NET AND YAHOO! OUT OF OFFICE.

29:30 ANNMARIE: MORE THAN 100 INDIVIDUALS ARE

29:31 STILL BEING HELD BY HAMAS. THIS WILL BE A HUGE FOCUS OF

29:34 THE ADMINISTRATION THIS WEEK. BIDEN IS SENDING -- OVER TO

29:39 EGYPT TO NEGOTIATE THIS DEAL. IT IS NOT JUST DOMESTICALLY

29:42 THAT THEY WANT TO GET THOSE HOSTAGES OUT.

29:47 THIS ADMINISTRATION LOOKS LIKE IF THEY CAN GET THE HOSTAGES

29:50 OUT, THAT COULD LEAD TO A CEASE-FIRE AND THAT PUTS

29:51 FURTHER PRESSURE ON THAT NOW WHO. JONATHAN:

29:54 AND BIDEN HAS BEEN HAMMERED ON THIS ISSUE WITHIN HIS OWN PARTY.

29:59 AT THE START OF THIS CAMPAIGN, WE SAW THE TWO LEADERS STANDING

30:00 SHOULDER TO SHOULDER. HOW MUCH DAYLIGHT IS THERE

30:04 BETWEEN NETANYAHU AND PRESIDENT BIDEN? ANNMARIE: IT'S A BIG GAP.

30:09 WE SAW BIDEN TICKET TRIP TO ISRAEL AND GIVE THIS BEARHUG

30:12 DID NETANYAHU, AN INDIVIDUAL WHERE THEY HAD A LOT OF

30:14 FRICTION LEADING UP TO THAT MOMENT AND NOW IT IS BECOMING

30:16 MORE TROUBLESOME FOR THIS ADMINISTRATION.

30:21 YOU HAVE PEOPLE IN HIS OWN PARTY SAYING WE ARE NOT GOING

30:22 TO DELIVER AID TO ISRAEL WITHOUT SOME STRINGS ATTACHED.

30:24 JONATHAN: TROUBLE FOR BOEING.

30:30 THE FAA EXPANDING EXPEND -- EXPANDING INSPECTIONS TO

30:34 ANOTHER 737 THAT HAS MID EXIT DOOR PLUGS, THE SAME INVOLVED

30:35 IN THE ALASKA AIRLINES BLOWOUT. BOEING SAYING THEY SUPPORT THE

30:43 ORDER TO INSPECT THE 737, AN OLDER GENERATION OF THE MAX

30:44 FAMILY.

30:51 LISA: I DON'T KNOW HOW THINGS COULD

30:52 GET WORSE. A COUPLE DAYS AGO THERE WAS

30:57 VIDEO OF A CARGO PLANE, A 737 BOEING JET ON FIRE, LITERALLY

31:01 ON FIRE AND SOME OF THE RHETORIC, PEOPLE POSTING THESE

31:02 VIDEOS. IT IS JUST PILING AT THIS

31:06 POINT, ESPECIALLY WITH THIS PARTICULAR INVESTIGATION.

31:09 BOEING SHARES DOWN MORE THAN 17%.

31:12 HOW DO THEY REVIVE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE WINDED -- WHEN IT'S

31:18 ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER?

31:20 JONATHAN: I DID NOT TAKE THE WINDOW SEAT

31:23 WHEN I FLEW BACK FROM SWITZERLAND. I TOOK THE AISLE.

31:27 IT'S PATHETIC BUT ULTIMATELY IT WAS ON MY MIND. LISA:

31:31 I CHECKED TO SEE IF WHAT A BOEING OR AN AIRBUS. JONATHAN:

31:32 WHAT WAS IT? LISA: IT WAS AN AIRBUS, WHICH I FOUND

31:36 RELIEVING. JONATHAN: THAT'S NOT GOOD. LISA:

31:42 IT WOULD GIVE ME ANXIETY IF IT WAS BOEING. JONATHAN:

31:45 A CONVERSATION THAT CAME UP OR P DIDDLY LAST WEEK, THE REALITY

31:46 CHECK FOR EV'S. JUST THREE YEARS AGO, THE WHITE

31:50 HOUSE WENT ALL IN.

31:55 >> THE FUTURE OF THE AUDIO AND -- OF THE AUTO INDUSTRY IS

31:57 ELECTRIC, THERE IS NO TURNING BACK. JONATHAN:

31:59 BUT NOW THE AUTO INDUSTRY IS TURNING BACK.

32:04 EV DELIVERIES FALLING SHORT OF ESTIMATES.

32:07 FORD CUTTING PRODUCTION OF ITS F-150 LINE.

32:10 JOINING US NOW IS CRAVE TRUDEAU. HOW MUCH A REALITY CHECK AND WE

32:14 SEEN IN THE LAST WEEK? -- HOW MUCH OF A REALITY CHECK

32:18 HAVE WE SEEN IN THE LAST WEEK? CRAIG:

32:24 TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN TO TESLA, THE

32:26 AMOUNT OF PRICE CUTTING THAT THEY DID LAST YEAR, AND TO

32:30 MENTAL GRAIN -- INTO MENTAL GAINS IN -- INCREMENTAL GAINS

32:34 IN VOLUME.

32:41 WE HAVE SEEN FORD GOING FROM POTENTIALLY FEARING THE ARRIVAL

32:42 OF THE CYBER TRUCK AND THE POTENTIAL THREAT THAT POSED TO

32:47 THE F-SERIES LINE AND PERHAPS NOT BEING AS AFRAID OF THE SORT

32:51 OF COMPETITIVE BLOW THAT COULD COME FROM THAT.

32:54 ALSO, LET'S BE HONEST, SOME OF THESE COMPANIES REALLY

32:58 STRUGGLING WITH EXECUTION ISSUES.

32:59 I DON'T THINK WE CAN ABSOLVE SOME OF THESE COMPANIES OF SOME

33:04 OF THE FAILURES THEY'VE HAD, TO TAKE TESLA ON AS MUCH AS MUCH

33:05 AS THEY ARE HAVING SOME CHALLENGES.

33:08 THEY ARE STILL REALLY SORT OF IN A TWO HORSE RACE WITH TESLA

33:12 BEING WAY OUT IN FRONT OF THE REST OF THE INDUSTRY AND MAKING

33:15 THIS TRANSITION. LISA: YOU MENTIONED BYD.

33:22 HOW MUCH OF THE PULLBACK FROM THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE SPACE BY

33:23 AMERICAN MANUFACTURERS REALLY COMES FROM THE THREAT THAT

33:27 CHINESE BENEFACTOR IS CAN SELL EV'S SO MUCH MORE CHEAPLY AND

33:29 AS SOON AS THEY COME TO THE SHORES OF THIS COUNTRY, PRICES

33:31 WILL DROP CONSIDERABLY? CRAIG: I DON'T THINK THEY WILL COME TO

33:36 THE U.S. IN PART BECAUSE OF THE TRADE

33:37 BARRIERS THAT HAVE BEEN SET UP. WE'VE HEARD RUMBLINGS OF THE

33:43 BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, RAISING TARIFFS THAT ARE ALREADY

33:44 PROHIBITIVE. I DON'T THINK CHINESE

33:49 MANUFACTURERS EARLY SEE THIS AS MAKING ANY SENSE, TRYING TO

33:53 ENTER THAT MARKET IN THE NEAR TERM.

33:56 I DO THINK WE WILL SEE A LOT OF POLITICKING AROUND THIS,

34:01 MESSAGING AROUND THE IDEA OF DO WE WANT TO GO THE WAY OF LOSING

34:05 OUT TO THE CHINESE? BOTH SIDES OF THE POLITICAL

34:09 AISLE WILL FIGHT ON THE BASIS OF, DO WE WANT TO FOLD TO THE

34:10 CHINESE? ON THE RIGHT, DO WE WANT TO GO

34:15 IN THE DIRECTION OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES WHEN THE CHINESE ARE

34:16 SO DOMINANT? IT'LL BE DIFFERENT MESSAGING

34:24 BUT BOTH WILL SURELY SORT OF CAST CHINA AS THE BOGEYMAN TO

34:27 EITHER TAKE ON OR SORT OF AVOID. ANNMARIE:

34:30 I'M STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT FORD IS PUSHING BACK SOME OF

34:35 THEIR TARGETS BUT THEY STILL HAVE TARGETS OF ELECTRIC

34:37 VEHICLE ADOPTION IN A MUCH MORE MAINSTREAM WAY.

34:43 DO YOU THINK THIS IS AN INTERRUPTED TRANSITION OR

34:44 SIMPLY ELITE TRANSITION? CRAIG: I THINK MORE SO -- SIMPLY A

34:49 DELAYED TRANSITION? CRAIG: I THINK MORE SO THE LATTER.

34:56 DOING A SLAPDASH EFFORT OF TAKING AN EXISTING PLATFORM IN

35:02 FORD'S CASE, ONLY SLIGHTLY ALTERING THE F-150 AND STICKING

35:05 A BATTERY IN IT, THAT IS NOT THE WAY TO MAKE A COMPELLING

35:08 ELECTRIC VEHICLE. WE SAW AN EFFORT ON FORD'S PART

35:16 TO REALLY SORT OF PLACE SPEED AHEAD OF ANYTHING ELSE AND GET

35:21 TO MARKET AHEAD OF GM WITH THE ELECTRIC SILVERADO, TO TAKE ON

35:25 THE LIKES OF RIVIAN AND THE CYBER TRUCK.

35:28 SOME SHORTCUTS THAT WERE TAKEN LED TO SOME COMPROMISES IN

35:31 TERMS OF HOW WELL THE F-150 LIGHTNING PERFORMS. WHAT WE ARE

35:35 GOING TO SEE IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS IS THESE CARMAKERS

35:39 BRING TO MARKET DEDICATED PLATFORMS THAT FROM THE GROUND

35:43 UP WERE PURPOSE BUILT TO BE ELECTRIC AND WE WILL SEE, MUCH

35:46 MORE COMPELLING VEHICLES AND THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THAT

35:50 WILL BE ENOUGH TO BRING THE CONSUMER WHO HAS PROVEN

35:54 DIFFICULT TO GET TO COME AROUND TO ELECT VEHICLES, WHETHER

35:56 THAT'LL BE ENOUGH TO SWAY THEM. LISA:

36:01 WE SPOKE TO JOHN KERRY LAST WEEK AND HE SAID IT IS COLD,

36:03 DISINFORMATION ON WHY CONSUMERS ARE NOT BEING CAUGHT UP AND

36:05 PERSUADED. A BY DEMONSTRATION OFFICIAL AND

36:11 -- CAME UP AND SAID MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE WHEN IT COMES TO

36:12 CHARGING STATIONS BECAUSE THAT IS A REAL CONCERN.

36:14 WHICH ONE IS IT? CRAIG: IT CAN BE BOTH.

36:20 THERE IS A LOT OF -- I MENTIONED THE WORD BOGEYMAN.

36:26 THERE IS SOME STRANGE ANTI-EEEV MESSAGING -- ANTI-EV MESSAGING,

36:31 JUST HOW CLEAN ARE THESE? YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY GET BY WITH

36:36 THE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE WHERE IT IS.

36:39 DOES THERE NEED TO BE MORE PROGRESS IN THIS REGARD?

36:40 ABSOLUTELY. ARE THERE PEOPLE ALL OVER THE

36:46 PLACE RUNNING OUT OF JUICE AND STRANDED BY THE ROADSIDE?

36:47 THAT IS NOT THE CASE. THERE IS SOME TRUTH IN THE

36:49 MIDDLE. I THINK THE INDUSTRY IS GOING

36:54 TO GO IN THIS DIRECTION, AND NEEDS TO FIGURE IT OUT.

36:57 I ALSO THINK IT IS GOING TO BE INTERESTING TO SEE JUST HOW

37:01 MUCH THIS COMPROMISE OF MAKING THE TRANSITION TO TESLA'S

37:04 CHARGING STANDER WILL HELP SOME OF THESE MANUFACTURERS.

37:07 THAT WAS A BIG DEAL LAST YEAR WITH A LOT OF ANNOUNCEMENTS BUT

37:11 WE WON'T SEE THAT COME TO FRUITION UNTIL THE COMING

37:14 MONTHS. WHETHER OR NOT THAT'LL HELP

37:16 RESOLVE SOME OF THESE CHARGING ISSUES FOR THESE OTHER

37:18 MANUFACTURERS WILL BE SOMETHING TO WATCH. JONATHAN:

37:22 APPRECIATE THE UPSTATE -- THE UPDATE, CRAIG.

37:27 -- RANGING ZAIDI IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF MISINFORMATION

37:32 -- RANGE ANXIETY IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF MISINFORMATION.

37:36 LISA: HONESTLY, I WAS GOING TO RENT A

37:39 CAR AND I DIDN'T RENT AN ELECTRIC CAR BECAUSE I DIDN'T

37:41 UNDERSTAND WHERE EXACTLY THE CHARGING STATIONS WOULD BE.

37:44 I DECIDED I DON'T WANT TO COMPLICATE MY VACATION.

37:46 EXPLAINING WHY PERHAPS SOME PEOPLE ARE SELLING. JONATHAN:

37:49 CLEARLY YOU ARE NOT ALONE. ANNMARIE:

37:57 INEVITABLY -- IN ITALY THIS SUMMER, I RENTED AN ELECTRIC

37:59 CAR AND THERE ARE APPS THAT SET UP CHARGING STATIONS AND ITALY

38:03 HAS PUT A TON OF MONEY INTO THE SOUTH OF THE COUNTRY.

38:08 YOU NEED THE CHARGING STATIONS IN ORDER FOR THIS TO WORK.

38:11 IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT, IT IS QUITE ANXIOUS. JONATHAN:

38:12 IT IS NOT THAT WE ARE RETHINKING THE END --

38:17 RETHINKING THE DESTINATION, THIS IS ABOUT THE PACE, THE

38:18 SPEED WE GET THERE. LISA: THE PROBLEM IS IF YOU CONFLATE

38:24 THE TWO, YOU END UP WITH REAL MIXED MESSAGES WHICH REALLY

38:27 COMES FROM THINGS LIKE PUMPING 13 MILLION BARRELS OF OIL A DAY

38:32 AND THEN TALKING ABOUT THE EVILS OF FOSSIL FUEL CREATION

38:36 AND EMISSION. HOW DO YOU HAVE CLARITY OF

38:39 MESSAGE WILDNESS -- WHILE RECOGNIZING THE THIS CITY OF A

38:41 LONGER PERIOD OF TRANSITION? JONATHAN:

38:43 LET'S GET YOU UP TO SPEED ON SOME OF THE HEADLINES.

38:46 LET'S SAY GOOD MORNING TO DANI BURGER. DANI:

38:51 ELON MUSK IS SET TO VISIT AUSCHWITZ AND ATTEND A PANEL ON

38:55 ONLINE ANTI-SEMITISM IS PART OF A TRIP ORGANIZED BY THE

38:57 EUROPEAN JEWISH ASSOCIATION. THEY ORGANIZED THE VISIT TO

39:03 ADDRESS A WORLDWIDE SURGE OF ANTI-JEWISH RHETORIC THAT

39:04 FOLLOWED ISRAEL'S INVASION OF GAZA AFTER HAMAS'S DEADLY

39:08 ATTACK ON OCTOBER 7.

39:10 ELON MUSK KOSTIN UPROAR AFTER ENDORSING AN ANTI-JEWISH

39:15 CONSPIRACY THEORY ON ASK. STATES AS FAR SOUTH AS TEXAS

39:20 AND FLORIDA FEELING THE FREEZE. SUBZERO CONDITIONS AND

39:24 DANGEROUS DRIVING CONDITIONS CLAIMED 72 LIVES NATIONALLY

39:27 AFTER SIGNIFICANT SNOWSTORMS THROUGH THROUGH EASTERN STATES.

39:31 FREEZING TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED TO EASE UP IN THE

39:32 COMING DAYS. THE KANSAS CITY CHIEFS ADVANCED

39:39 TO THEIR SIXTH STRAIGHT AFC CHAMPIONSHIP WITH A WIN OVER

39:40 THE BUFFALO BILLS ON SUNDAY NIGHT.

39:45 THE CHIEFS ENDED THE SEASON IN THREE OF THE PAST FOR PLAYOFFS

39:48 AND NOW THE CHIEFS MOVE ON TO BALTIMORE TO FACE THE

39:49 TOP-SEEDED RAVENS. THAT IS YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF.

39:53 JONATHAN: IMPRESSED THAT WE GOT THROUGH

39:55 THAT WITHOUT MENTIONING A CERTAIN NAME. ANNMARIE:

39:56 TAYLOR SWIFT. SHE WAS IN ATTENDANCE.

40:01 ROOTING FOR NEW YORK. I WOULD RATHER THAT BUFFALO

40:05 WINS. JONATHAN: I APPRECIATE THE INSIGHT.

40:11 UP NEXT, THE FED DIALING BACK. RATE CUT EXPECTATIONS.

40:18 >> WE DON'T WANT TO LOOSEN POLICY TOO QUICKLY ONLY TO FIND

40:20 THAT INFLATION GETS STUCK AT WAY ABOVE TARGET.

40:22 THAT WOULD BE A MESS. JONATHAN: THAT'S COMING UP NEXT.

40:26 YOU ARE WATCHING BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE. ♪

40:48 JONATHAN: LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY, GOOD

40:49 MORNING. S&P 500 HIGHER BY A THIRD OF 1%.

40:55 EQUITY FEATURES IN POSITIVE TERRITORY.

40:59 YIELDS LOWER BY TWO PACES -- BY TWO BASIS POINTS.

41:05 THE FED DIALING BACK RATE CUT EXPECTATIONS.

41:08 >> WE DON'T WANT TO LOOSEN POLICY TOO QUICKLY, ONLY TO

41:12 FIND THAT INFLATION GETS STUCK AT ABOVE TARGET.

41:16 THAT WOULD BE A MISS, A VERY SCARRING MISS.

41:19 YOU DON'T WANT TO TRY TO GET TO TWO SO QUICKLY, LIKE OVERNIGHT,

41:24 JUST TO GET THAT SQUEEZED OUT AND WE END UP HAVING THIS BIG

41:25 RUN UP. JONATHAN: THAT WAS THE SAN FRANCISCO FED

41:31 PRESIDENT SPEAKING AT THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY ECONOMIC

41:32 ROUNDTABLE. WE HEARD A LOT OF THAT LAST

41:34 WEEK. LISA: THIS SORT OF PERFECT BALANCE,

41:37 BUT HOW DO YOU GET THERE? HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU ARE

41:41 ACTUALLY AT THAT PERFECT BALANCE GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE

41:44 HARD DATA LOOKS PRETTY GOOD?

41:50 PATRICK PARKER CAME OUT WITH AN ESSAY THAT I THOUGHT WAS

41:51 FASCINATING. HE SAID WE WILL BE GUIDED

41:56 EQUALLY BY THE SOFT AND HARD DATA WRITING QUOTE, AS

41:59 IMPORTANT AS THE HARD DATA ARE, THEY DO NOT TELL THE COMPLETE

42:02 STORY. SOFT DATA HELP NOT ONLY BETTER

42:04 EXPLAIN WHAT I MAY BE SEEING IN THE ECONOMIC UPDATES BUT CAN

42:08 ALSO GIVE ME INSIGHTS OF EMERGING ISSUES THAT MAY NOT

42:09 SHOW UP IN THE NUMBERS UNTIL FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD.

42:12 THIS TO ME IS ONE OF THE KEY QUESTIONS.

42:16 WHAT ARE THE TEA LEAVES THE POLICYMAKERS ARE LOOKING TO, TO

42:17 KNOW WHEN TO MAKE A MOVE? JONATHAN: ANECDOTES.

42:22 WE SAT DOWN WITH HIM AND WE TALKED ABOUT EXACTLY THIS.

42:24 WHAT BUSINESSES WERE TELLING HIM ON THE GROUND. LISA:

42:28 HE SAID THAT WAS A BETTER INDICATOR WE SAW THE TURN OF

42:30 INFLATION, SAW THE TURN OF THINGS GOING UP, THAN A LOT OF

42:33 THE HARD DATA. WHAT IS THE SOFT DATA THEY ARE

42:35 LOOKING AT? PEOPLE AND BUSINESSES TELLING

42:38 HIM THAT THEY ARE NOT LOOKING VERY GOOD?

42:40 PEOPLE ARE OPTIMISTIC. WHERE IS DISSONANCE HERE?

42:47 JONATHAN: GREAT TO CATCH UP. WHAT IS GUIDING YOU?

42:53 WHAT IS ON YOUR DASHBOARD, THE ECONOMIC DATA YOU ARE LOOKING

43:01 AT? SEVEN:

43:02 THE HARD DATA IS BACKWARD LOOKING.

43:07 ANYONE WHO HAS TAKEN A SURVEY RECENTLY AFTER HAVING A

43:09 PARTICULAR SERVICE WILL KNOW WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

43:10 BECAUSE THEY ARE FED UP WITH THEM.

43:14 I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE SOFT DATA AND THE

43:17 FORWARD-LOOKING DATA. FOR ME, WHAT MATTERS MORE THAN

43:22 ANYTHING ELSE IS THE DISTANCE BETWEEN TODAY'S POLICY RATE AND

43:24 THE LONGER RUN. IT'S ABOUT 3%.

43:31 I'M NOT THAT INTERESTED ON THE DATES AND THE AMOUNTS OF THE

43:33 FIRST RATE CUT WHICH SEEMS TO BE WHERE MOST PEOPLE ARE.

43:36 THE NEXT MOVE IS DOWN. YOU SEE IT IS UNCHANGED OR DOWN.

43:40 IT IS NOT UP. THAT BINARY OUTLOOK FOR RATES

43:48 MAKES IT MUCH EASIER TO JUSTIFY A LONG POSITION IN BONDS THAN

43:51 IT DID THREE TO SIX MONTHS AGO. LISA: AT THE SAME TIME, IF THEY

43:56 DON'T CUT RATES UNTIL DECEMBER, THAT'LL SURPRISE THE MARKET TO

43:57 THE DOWNSIDE. HOW DO YOU JUSTIFY BEING

44:03 BULLISH NOW, WHEN WE ARE ALREADY SEEING A LOT OF IT

44:04 BEING PRICED IN AND PEOPLE GETTING AHEAD OF THEMSELVES?

44:07 STEVEN: WE'VE GOT A NEUTRAL CALL FOR

44:13 THIS MONTH AND I TELL MY COLLEAGUES IF IT IS OBVIOUS WE

44:16 ARE GOING SIDEWAYS FOR SIX MONTHS AND THEN THE YIELDS ARE

44:17 GOING TO GO DOWN IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, WHAT ARE WE

44:19 WAITING FOR? YOU HAVE THE CARRY AND THE

44:22 COUPON IN THE MEANTIME. IN THE BIGGEST PERIOD, THE

44:30 BIGGEST BEAR MARKET WAS 1961-1980.

44:33 THE ANNUALIZED RETURN WAS STILL ABOUT 4% PER YEAR.

44:35 THAT KIND OF THING HAPPENED LAST YEAR, YOU ENDED UP WITH

44:39 PLUS 4% ON THE YEAR. THAT IS HOW BONDS WORK.

44:49 I GET THE IDEA THAT IF THEY DON'T CUT IN 2024 FOR WHATEVER

44:54 REASON, THAN THE TWO YEAR YIELD SHOULD BE NEARER TO FIVE AND

44:59 THAT COULD PUSH THE TENS NEARER TO 4.5%.

45:01 THEY MIGHT CUT AN AWFUL LOT TOO. YOU HAVE TO BALANCE THOSE TWO

45:04 SCENARIOS. LISA: AT THE SAME TIME WE ARE GETTING

45:09 TREASURY OPTIONS THIS YEAR, THIS WEEK.

45:15 WINDOW WE START TO WORRY ABOUT SUPPLY, ESPECIALLY AS

45:16 QUANTITATIVE TIGHTENING CONTINUES? STEVEN:

45:20 YOU KNOW THAT WE GET THAT QUESTION QUITE A LOT AND THE

45:28 SUPPLY SIDE IS JUST ONE ANGLE IN THE WHOLE PICTURE.

45:31 THE DEMAND FOR BONDS TODAY IS HIGHER THAN IT WAS THREE MONTHS

45:38 AGO AND THAT IS A PARADOX BECAUSE YIELDS OF 5%, IT SEEMS

45:40 WERE LESS ATTRACTIVE THAN YIELDS AT 4%.

45:44 I HOPE I AM MAKING SENSE. THERE IS MORE DEMAND FOR BONDS

45:47 THAN THERE WAS BACK THEN, BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT CERTAINTY

45:52 AROUND THE OUTLOOK. RATES ARE NOT GOING UP.

45:54 THEY WILL BE UNCHANGED OR DOWN. THAT IS WHY 10 YEAR YIELDS ARE

45:59 LESS. THERE IS $5 TRILLION OR SO SITTING IN MONEY MARKETS.

46:10 PRE-PANDEMIC IT WAS $2.5 TRILLION?

46:14 PRESUMABLY SOME OF THAT MONEY IS SHIFTING INTO BONDS OR SOON

46:16 WILL BE BECAUSE THERE WILL BE A HUGE REGRET IF IT STAYS IN

46:19 MONEY MARKETS AND THE FED IS CUTTING. JONATHAN:

46:24 DOES SUPPLY MATTER? WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT SUPPLY

46:25 RELATIVE TO THE CYCLE. HOW RARE IS IT TO SEE A DEFICIT

46:32 THIS LARGE, TO SEE ISSUANCE THAT LISA JUST WENT THROUGH

46:35 WITH UNEMPLOYMENT STILL SOUTH OF 4%? STEVEN:

46:40 I HAD A MIA CULP A LAST YEAR. I UNDERSTAND SHY UNDERESTIMATED

46:44 THE SURGEONS. THE INCREASING COUPON ISSUANCE

46:52 FOR THE AUGUST TO NOVEMBER PERIOD HAPPENED WHEN THE CURVE

46:57 WAS DEEPLY INVERTED, BETWEEN MONEY MARKETS AND BONDS.

46:59 THE U.S. HAD JUST BEEN DOWNGRADED THE

47:04 BEGINNING OF AUGUST AND THE GDP HOLDING UP.

47:07 THE COMPLEMENTS OF THOSE EVENTS MADE IT DIFFICULT TO JUSTIFY

47:09 BUYING TENS. TODAY YOU'VE GOT DIFFERENT

47:13 CIRCUMSTANCES. WE ARE CHUCKING YOU ALONG, BUT

47:18 WE ARE CLOSER TO THE RECESSION. YOU HAVEN'T GOT SUCH A GREAT IN

47:20 VERSION. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE SUPPLY

47:26 IS COMING INTO A MUCH MORE WILLING DEMAND ENVIRONMENT.

47:31 YOU CAN LOOK AT IT FROM THE MONEY MARKETS, YOU CAN LOOK AT

47:35 IT FROM THE LEVEL OF EQUITY PRICES, YOU CAN LOOK AT WHAT

47:36 OVERSEAS INVESTORS HAVE BEEN DOING.

47:39 ULTIMATELY WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THE DEMAND FOR

47:41 BONDS, NOT JUST THE SUPPLY. WHAT I FIND INTERESTING IS HOW

47:46 ALL THE QUESTIONS SEEM TO BE ANGLED AT JUST ONE FACTOR, THE

47:50 FACT THAT THERE IS SOME FAIRLY BIG SUPPLY COMING UP.

47:55 IT DOES NOT MATTER, THERE IS PLENTY OF DEMAND. JONATHAN:

47:57 LET'S TALK ABOUT BOTH. HAS THE PLAYBOOK CHANGED?

48:04 I HEAR THAT YOU DON'T THINK IT HAS, THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO

48:06 FINANCE THIS DEFICIT WHEN THE TAX RECEIPTS FALL. STEVEN:

48:11 WE'VE HAD A COUPLE OF EPISODES THAT HAVE MADE US WORRY.

48:18 POINTED ONE OUT LAST YEAR, IN PARTICULAR THERE WAS ONE THAT

48:20 HAPPENED -- THERE WAS WHAT HAPPENED IN THE U.K.

48:21 ONE YEAR BEFORE THAT. A U.K. FISCAL EXPERIMENT.

48:28 YOU SEE THESE THINGS HAPPEN OCCASIONALLY.

48:31 TAPER TANTRUM WAS SOMETHING SIMILAR.

48:34 ULTIMATELY THESE ARE SHORT-TERM EVENTS. THEY DON'T DETERMINE THE

48:37 LONG-TERM VALUE OF A BOND. A BOND'S VALUATION IS MAINLY

48:45 DRIVEN BY THE SHORT READ AND ITS EXPECTED PATH.

48:49 PEOPLE ARE STACKING A LOAD OF PREMIUM ONTO THEIR PROJECTIONS

48:55 WHICH IS ALL VERY WELL BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE BONDS VALUE IS

48:57 EXPLAINED BY THE SHORTER END. JONATHAN:

49:01 FRUSTRATED BY THE QUESTION THAT HE IS ASKED REPEATEDLY ABOUT

49:06 SUPPLY.

49:07 IN THE HEAT OF DUBAI, STEVE MAJOR OF HSBC. GOOD TO CATCH UP.

49:12 THE PLAYBOOK IS NOT CHANGED FOR THE TEAM AT HSBC. LISA:

49:15 BONDS ARE GOING TO GO LOWER AND THAT SEEMS TO BE THE CONVICTION

49:16 THAT CONTINUES. JONATHAN:

49:39 >> THE MARKET IS BEING AGGRESSIVE ON RATE CUTS AND I

49:43 BELIEVE THAT THE FED IS GOING TO TAKE IT'S TIME.

49:46 >> BY THE END OF THE YEAR, THEY WILL START CUTTING.

49:49 >> OUR CORE TEAM HAS FOUR CUTS.

49:51 >> SIX RATE CUTS. THAT'S A PIPE DREAM IF WE HAVE

49:55 A SOFT LANDING.

49:59 >> THE MARKET IS NOW CALLING FOR 175 BASIS POINT CUTS I THE

50:00 FED. HOW ABOUT THIS? NO WAY. NO WAY AT ALL.

50:10 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE WITH JONATHAN

50:12 FERRO, LISA ABRAMOWICZ AND ANNMARIE HORDERN. JONATHAN:

50:19 TRAVIS KELCE AND TAYLOR SWIFT, THIS SHOW IS GOING TO KILL ME.

50:23 FOR OUR AUDIENCE WORLDWIDE, THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE.

50:27 I AM JONATHAN FERRO. FINANCIAL MARKETS POSITIVE BY A

50:31 THIRD OF 1% ON THE S&P 500. THE LAST WEEK, THINGS HAVE BEEN

50:34 DECENT. JOBLESS CLAIMS WERE LOWER.

50:38 CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IS PICKING UP. LISA: IT ALL SOUNDS SO GOOD.

50:46 IN DAY OF -- IN DAVOS, EVERYONE WAS SO OPTIMISTIC.

50:50 WE DON'T THINK THIS HAS MUCH FURTHER TO GO. JONATHAN:

50:53 THE PRESIDENT HOPES IT DOES. ANNMARIE:

50:59 WHEN THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN CAME OUT IN THE CONFIDENCE

51:01 REPORT, I GOT A LOT OF MESSAGES FROM PEOPLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE

51:06 SAYING THEY NEED THOSE NEWS STORIES, SAYING PEOPLE ARE

51:07 STARTING TO FEEL BETTER ABOUT THE ECONOMY. LISA: BUT ENOUGH?

51:10 THAT IS THE QUESTION. DO OIL PRICES STAY LOW ENOUGH

51:14 TO KEEP THE CONFIDENCE GOING? HOW MUCH IS THAT SURVEY

51:20 CONNECTED TO GAS PRICES IN THE UNITED STATES? ANNMARIE:

51:27 EXXON, SHELL, THAT IS HUGE. THAT NEEDS TO BE THE PRICE OF

51:32 GASOLINE NEXT SEPTEMBER, OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER. JONATHAN:

51:36 THE WHITE HOUSE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, NOT

51:39 13 MILLION BARRELS A DAY PRODUCED IN THIS COUNTRY, WITH

51:43 THE EXCEPTION OF ONE MAN. HE SAID IT WAS NECESSARY,

51:46 SECRETARY KERRY. LISA: I ASKED HIM IF THIS WAS A

51:52 POLICY SUCCESS OR A FAILURE AND HE SAID IT WAS A POLICY

51:55 NECESSITY BECAUSE OF YOU GET HIGHER OIL PRICES YOU GET RIOTS

51:57 AND SOCIAL DISRUPTION. HOW DO YOU DOVETAIL A MESSAGE

52:01 OF SUSTAINABILITY OVER THE LONG-TERM WITH THE REALITY IN

52:03 THE SHORT TERM WHICH IS PEOPLE ARE MOVING A LOT LESS QUICKLY

52:05 THAN WHAT PEOPLE EXPECTED? JONATHAN:

52:08 BRENT CRUDE JUST SOUTH OF $80. A LITTLE BIT OF A LIFT ON THE

52:11 S&P 500. DRIFTING HIGH ON EQUITY FUTURES.

52:19 DOWN ABOUT THREE, TO 4.09%. LISA:

52:23 WE'VE SEEN A PRETTY BIG SELLOFF IN BONDS AND WHAT I FIND

52:25 FASCINATING IS WE HAVE REACHED ALL-TIME HIGHS IN NVIDIA THAT

52:29 HAS DRIVEN THE REST OF THE INDEX WHILE BONDS HAVE SOLD OFF.

52:33 THIS IS A HUGE QUESTION. CAN THIS CONTINUE GIVEN THAT

52:35 PEOPLE ARE OPTIMISTIC? JONATHAN: COMING UP, THAT TWO WEEK

52:40 WINNING STREAK, TAKING STOCKS BACK TO ALL-TIME HIGHS.

52:47 GOLDMAN, MORGAN STANLEY, MICROSOFT AND APPLE STILL TO

52:48 COME. LISA: THOSE TO ME ARE GOING TO BE THE

52:52 REAL DETERMINANTS OF WHETHER WE. SEE THIS RALLY CONTINUE.

52:57 THE AI HIKE, CAN IT TRANSLATE INTO ACTUAL PROFITS?

52:58 ARE THEY MAKING HEADWAY OR SIMPLE HE DEFENDING THEMSELVES

53:01 FROM INTERRUPTERS WHO ARE GOING TO CHANGE THE WAY WE DO

53:05 EVERYTHING, CHANGE THE WAY WE ARE EMPLOYED? JONATHAN:

53:09 JUST GOING TO START THEIR. THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY

53:14 NARROWING DOWN TO JUST TWO CANDIDATES.

53:16 NIKKI HALEY VERSUS DONALD TRUMP. ANNMARIE:

53:18 I SPOKE TO THE DESANTIS CAMP AND THEY SAID THERE IS NO PATH

53:23 FORWARD. HE TRIED TO ESTABLISH HIMSELF

53:25 AS SOMEONE LIKE TRUMP BUT WITHOUT THE BAGGAGE.

53:29 THAT DOESN'T WORK WHEN YOU BASICALLY HAVE AN INCUMBENT IN

53:30 YOUR PRIMARY FIELD. LISA: I'VE JUST BEEN WONDERING WHO IS

53:35 GOING TO BE VICE PRESIDENT? NIKKI HALEY IS GOING TO DROP

53:37 OUT AND IF THIS IS GOING TO BE AT DONALD TRUMP-JOE BIDEN

53:39 MATCHUP. WHAT IS THE TURN NOT GOING TO

53:42 LOOK FOR THIS THING THAT EXCITED ABOUT? JONATHAN:

53:46 I WILL WAS TERRIBLE BUT THAT WAS THE TEMPERATURE. ANNMARIE:

53:48 IT WAS COLD. LISA: THERE IS NOT A LOT OF

53:52 ENTHUSIASM FOR THIS. A LOT OF PEOPLE IN PRIVATE

53:57 CONVERSATIONS, EXECUTIVES AND BEYOND SAYING THIS IS WHAT

53:59 WE'VE GOT? THESE INDIVIDUALS? JONATHAN:

54:03 THE FINAL HEADLINE LATER IN THE SHOW, THE UNITED STATES

54:05 STRUGGLING TO CONTAIN HOUTHI ATTACKS IN THE RED SEA.

54:09 THE PRESIDENT ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE STRIKES ARE NOT

54:11 WORKING BUT THEN BASICALLY EXPLAINING THEY WILL CONTINUE.

54:14 LISA: THIS IS A TRICKY MOMENT. HOW DO YOU PREVENT ESCALATION

54:19 AT A TIME WHEN YOU HAVE TO FORTIFY THE ABILITY TO TRADE IN

54:20 THE SEA? THE INDEPENDENCE AND THE SAFETY

54:23 OF THE SEA? THIS IS GOING TO BE A QUAGMIRE

54:26 THAT GOES ON FOR A LONG TIME. PEOPLE SHRUG IT OFF.

54:31 IT IS AVOIDING ESCALATION. WHEN DOES THAT TRIP SOME KIND

54:34 OF LIVEWIRE? JONATHAN: WE WILL PICK UP ON THAT STORY

54:36 LATER. WE BEGIN WITH OUR TOP STORY,

54:41 STOCKS TRADING AT RECORD HIGHS. BOB DIAMOND, CEO OF ATLAS

54:47 MERGER CAPITAL, WARNING THE FOLLOWING.

54:49 THE FED IS LIKE ME TO PROCEED WITH CAUTION.

54:53 A RATE CUT OR EVEN TWO THIS YEAR COULD OCCUR BUT THE

54:54 ECONOMY IS LIKE YOU TO CONTINUE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT CAN

54:56 HANDLE THE CURRENT LEVEL OF INTEREST RATES.

54:58 BOB DIAMOND JOINS US NOW. BOB: GOOD MORNING. JONATHAN:

55:01 FANTASTIC TO SEE YOU. RETAIL SALES ARE SOLID,

55:06 OPTIMISM IS PICKING UP. WHAT EVIDENCE IS THERE THAT WE

55:12 ARE SUFFICIENTLY RESTRICTIVE AT THE FED? BOB:

55:16 I THINK CONSENSUS IN MY MIND IS ABOUT WHAT PERCENT GROWTH -- 1%

55:18 GROWTH THIS YEAR.

55:25 I THING IT MIGHT BE HIGHER THAN THAT.

55:26 AS A LOOK OUT AT THE YEAR, IF THE FED WERE TO BE AGGRESSIVE

55:34 IN RATE CUTS, FIRST-QUARTER OR SECOND-QUARTER, THEY RUN THE

55:35 RISK OF THE ECONOMY ACCELERATING A BIT, THEREFORE

55:39 INFLATION ACCELERATING A BIT. THAT IS JUST A POSITION THE FED

55:43 IS NOT GOING TO PUT THEMSELVES IN. MY SENSE IS THE RIGHT WAY TO

55:50 LOOK AT THIS, RATHER THAN THE MARKETS, IF YOU LOOK AT THE FED

55:54 FUND FUTURES, 150 BASIS POINTS THIS YEAR IS KIND OF FRONT

55:58 ANDED -- FRONT ENDED. RATE CUTS CLOSER TO THE END OF

56:05 THE YEAR BUT I BELIEVE THE FED IS GOING TO REMAIN CAUTIOUS FOR

56:07 VERY GOOD REASON. THEY PRETTY MUCH PLAYED

56:12 BLINDERS BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE THAT INFLATION WAS SPIRALING

56:15 OUT OF CONTROL NOT THAT LONG AGO.

56:19 WE ARE IN A VERY GOOD POSITION NOW AND FOR THE FED TO ACT TOO

56:22 QUICKLY WOULD PUT THEM IN A DIFFICULT POSITION.

56:26 OUR SENSE IS THE MARKET IS WELL AHEAD OF THEMSELVES IN TERMS OF

56:32 RATE CUTS. LISA:

56:34 WHEN YOU SAY BOND MARKETS, HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE SAYING THIS IS

56:36 A BOND MARKET PROBLEM? IT IS NOT A STOCKMARKET PROBLEM

56:39 BECAUSE IF THE ECONOMY IS BETTER THAN GOOD, THAT IS

56:41 POSITIVE FOR RISK ASSETS. BOB: IT RAISES ANOTHER ISSUE, WHICH

56:45 IS WE WERE FOR SO LONG AT ZERO INTEREST RATES OR 1% INTEREST

56:51 RATES. WE ALL REMEMBER HERE, THE WORLD

56:54 BEFORE 2008. FROM 2008 UNTIL VERY RECENTLY,

56:59 THE FED FUNDS AVERAGED ABOUT 1%. BEFORE THAT FOR DECADES AND

57:06 DECADES, FED FUNDS AVERAGED AROUND 4% OR A LITTLE ABOVE 4%.

57:12 WHERE WE ARE TODAY IS NOT ABNORMAL AND OUR SENSE IS THAT

57:14 THE ECONOMY IS ADJUSTED PRESUMABLY WELL.

57:20 WE SEE THAT IN THE COMMONNESS OF THE BOND MARKET AND THE

57:21 EQUITY MARKET. THERE IS NOT A PANIC BY THE FED

57:24 TO LOWER INTEREST RATES. LISA: YOU ARE AT BARCLAYS WEEDING THE

57:29 CHARGE FOR QUITE A TIME. CREDIT SUISSE.

57:33 YOU'VE BEEN IN THE BANKING BUSINESS FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

57:39 INTEREST RATES ARE HIGHER, BUT ALSO THERE IS A WHOLE HOST OF

57:42 REGULATION THAT IS CRAMPING LENDING ACTIVITIES.

57:46 WHERE IS THE OPPORTUNITY AT A TIME WHERE IT SEEMS LIKE

57:49 LENDING COULD BE PROFITABLE IF THERE WEREN'T SO MANY

57:54 CONSTRAINTS? BOB:

57:55 .1 WOULD BE IF YOU LOOK AT THE U.S.

57:57 BANKS AND IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE TYPICALLY REPORT AS

58:02 EARNINGS, WE TEND TO REPORT THE BIG BANKS, AND THE BIG FOUR,

58:05 THE BIG SIX OF THE U.S. CONTINUE TO GET LARGER, MORE

58:11 CONCENTRATED THAN THEY WERE PRIOR TO 2008 AND THAT

58:14 CONCENTRATION DOES WEIGH ON ME A BIT.

58:19 DO WE REALLY THINK THAT FEWER BANKS, LARGER BANKS, MORE

58:21 CONCENTRATED BANKS IS BETTER FOR THE U.S. ECONOMY?

58:23 I DON'T THINK SO. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS BEEN

58:28 THE LIFEBLOOD OF OUR ECONOMY, AND THE REASON THAT THE U.S.

58:32 REACTS SO QUICKLY TO NEGATIVE NEWS AND NEGATIVE PERIODS,

58:36 PARTICULARLY RELATIVE TO EUROPE AND OTHER SECTORS AROUND THE

58:40 WORLD, IS BECAUSE OF THE DIVERSIFICATION OF THE

58:41 FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. I DO WORRY ABOUT THAT.

58:48 I THINK EARNINGS HAVE BEEN GOOD, BUT THE LARGER

58:50 INTERCONNECTED BANKS ARE BECOMING MUCH MORE LIKE

58:51 UTILITIES. THE PUSH BACK ON HIGHER

58:57 CAPITAL, I ACTUALLY THINK IT IS GOING TO BE AN EFFECTIVE FOR

59:01 JUST THAT REASON, BECAUSE THE BANKS ARE BECOMING MORE

59:04 CONCENTRATED AND THEY ARE BECOMING LARGER. LISA:

59:06 WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS IMPACT OF THE NEW CAPITAL

59:09 REQUIREMENTS? THEY POTENTIALLY FACE AN EVEN

59:11 TOUGHER ROAD AHEAD. BOB: A LOT OF THAT CAPITAL IS FOR

59:19 THE LARGER INTERCONNECTED BANKS, WHAT PEOPLE USED TO

59:20 REFER TO AS TOO BIG TO FAIL. THAT IS WHERE THE BIGGEST

59:25 IMPACT WILL BE AND I CAN KIND OF UNDERSTAND BOTH SIDES OF

59:28 THAT ARGUMENT. ON THE ONE HAND, THE BANKS ARE

59:34 SAYING HIGHER CAPITAL LEVELS ARE NO LONGER SAFE RIGHT NOW,

59:37 WHICH THEY ARE, IT IS GOING TO LOWER OUR WAY INTO REDUCED

59:41 LENDING BUT IF YOU ARE A REGULATOR AND YOU ARE WORRIED

59:45 ABOUT EVER BEING IN A POSITION WHERE THERE IS SYSTEMIC RISK OR

59:48 TOO BIG TO FAIL, EVEN TO THE BANKS ARE DOING GREAT, AND THEY

59:52 ARE SAFE TODAY, THE RISK IF THERE WAS A FAILURE IS GREATER.

59:58 MY VIEW, AND THIS DOES FIT MY BOOK, WE LOVE TO INVEST IN

01:00:04 REGIONAL BANKS AND I WANT TO CLAIM THAT THAT IS KIND OF OUR

01:00:08 BIAS BUT THERE ARE 4000 OR SO REGIONAL SPECIALIST BANKS TODAY.

01:00:14 THERE IS NO COUNTRY THAT HAS THAT KIND OF FINANCIAL SERVICES

01:00:16 INDUSTRY AND THAT KIND OF A REACH.

01:00:20 THE BENEFIT THOSE BANKS HAVE FOR SMALL FAMILY OWNED

01:00:23 BUSINESSES, WHICH AGAIN, THE LIFEBLOOD OF THE U.S.

01:00:24 ECONOMY, IS REALLY IMPORTANT. THERE WILL BE CONSOLIDATION.

01:00:30 I DO THINK THOSE BANKS ARE REACTING WELL TO HIGHER

01:00:33 INTEREST RATES NOW, VERSUS THE IMMEDIATE IMPACT OF HIGHER

01:00:35 INTEREST RATES. WE THINK THERE IS GOING TO BE

01:00:39 TERRIFIC OPPORTUNITIES IN REGIONAL BANKS.

01:00:44 WE LOVE THAT AS A SPACE TO INVEST IN BUT WE THINK IT IS

01:00:49 INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT WE PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE

01:00:50 INSTITUTIONS TO CONTINUE TO GROW AND SERVE SMALLER AND

01:00:54 MEDIUM ENTERPRISE BUSINESSES. IN TERMS OF REGIONAL BANKS, FOR

01:00:58 SURE. I THINK THERE ARE A COUPLE OF

01:01:00 THINGS.

01:01:06 EVERY BANK, LARGE, SMALL, MEDIUM HAD TO ADJUST THEIR

01:01:08 PORTFOLIO TO HIGHER RATES. WHEN RATES GO FROM 1% TO 5%, IT

01:01:14 IS GOING TO IMPACT -- YOU CAN'T HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT OF THAT.

01:01:18 YOU HAVE TO WEATHER THAT AND IT HAS BEEN MANAGED. PRETTY WELL.

01:01:22 THE SECOND THING IS THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF WORRY ABOUT THE

01:01:26 LOW PORTFOLIOS, PARTICULARLY COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE.

01:01:30 FOR MANY OF THESE REGIONAL AND MORE SPECIALIST BANKS, THEIR

01:01:34 FOCUS ON COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE IS MORE IN SMALL CITIES AROUND

01:01:37 THE COUNTRY AS OPPOSED TO NEW YORK OR L.A.

01:01:42 THE MARKETS ARE GETTING MORE COMFORTABLE THAT THE CRISIS IS

01:01:45 BEHIND US, BUT I DO THINK THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:01:47 CONSOLIDATION. THE IMPACT OF REGULATORY

01:01:54 CAPITAL, THE IMPACT OF REGULATORY INTRUSION, IS

01:01:55 INCREASING COSTS. I THINK THE HIGHER INTEREST

01:02:00 RATES FOR A WHILE INCREASED COSTS.

01:02:04 SOME OF THE VERY SMALL REGIONAL AND SPECIALIST BANKS, ALTHOUGH

01:02:08 VERY SOUND ARE GOING TO STRUGGLE TO GET THINGS TO

01:02:12 APPROPRIATE LEVELS. JONATHAN: LANGUAGE MATTERS, INVESTING

01:02:14 VERSUS BUYING. WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN

01:02:17 TAKING OVER A REGIONAL BANK IN THE UNITED STATES? BOB:

01:02:21 AS AN INVESTOR? WHAT I LOVE THAT AS OPPOSED TO

01:02:23 AN OPERATOR?

01:02:25 WE DO THINK OF OURSELVES NOT JUST AS INVESTORS BUT AS

01:02:35 OPERATORS. IF WE MAKE A SIGNIFICANT

01:02:41 INVESTMENT IN A REGIONAL BANK, STAYING AS NONEXECUTIVE, WE CAN

01:02:44 STILL HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE GROWTH AND THAT IS HOW I

01:02:48 LOOK AT IT. WHAT I LIKE TO GET INVOLVED

01:02:51 WITH A COUPLE OF REGIONAL BANKS? ABSOLUTELY JONATHAN:

01:02:54 HAVE YOU IDENTIFIED ONE? BOB: I CAN'T SAY THAT. JONATHAN:

01:02:58 WE ARE TRYING TO TEASE THIS OUT. BOB:

01:03:00 A VERY GOOD QUESTION THOUGH. JONATHAN:

01:03:03 YOU HAVE A COUPLE MINUTES TO CHEW OVER BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING

01:03:04 TO BE WITH US. BOB DIAMOND POTENTIALLY LOOKING

01:03:11 AT A REGIONAL BANK IN THE U.S. LET'S CATCH UP WITH DANI BURGER.

01:03:15 DANI: GOOD MORNING. FLORIDA GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS

01:03:20 HAS DROPPED OUT OF THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL RACE.

01:03:22 HE IS NOW ENDORSING DONALD TRUMP.

01:03:26 DESANTIS'S EXIT IS JUST TWO DAYS BEFORE THE NEW HAMPSHIRE

01:03:27 PRIMARIES. FORMER U.N. AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY IS NOW

01:03:31 THE SECOND PLACE CANDIDATE. THE LATEST POLLING SHOWING

01:03:35 TRUMP LEADING NEW HAMPSHIRE WITH 50%, HALEY WITH 35%.

01:03:42 CHINA'S IMPORTS OF CHIPMAKING MACHINES JUMPED LAST YEAR.

01:03:49 IMPORTS OF MACHINERY USED TO MAKE COMPUTER CHIPS ROSE 14% IN

01:03:53 2023 TO ALMOST $40 BILLION. BLACKROCK IS LOOKING TO SELL IN

01:03:57 OFFICE COMPLEX IN SHANGHAI. IT WOULD BE AT ABOUT A 30%

01:04:01 DISCOUNT TO ITS PURCHASE PRICE. THE ASSET MANAGER WANTS TO

01:04:05 SPEED UP THE SALE OF SHANGHAI TOWERS.

01:04:09 OTHER INVESTORS HAVE BEEN OFFLOADING OFFICES AS A WEAK

01:04:12 ECONOMY AND OVERSUPPLY WEIGH ON THE CHINESE ECONOMY SECTOR.

01:04:15 THAT IS YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF. JONATHAN:

01:04:19 UP NEXT, STOCKS AT ALL-TIME HIGHS.

01:04:23 >> IF THE FED IS NOT CUTTING RATES BECAUSE THE ECONOMY

01:04:26 REMAINS STRONG, I THINK THE U.S. EQUITY MARKET WILL BE PRETTY

01:04:28 MUCH FINE WITH THAT. IF THE FED IS CUTTING RATES

01:04:32 BECAUSE THE ECONOMY IS VERY WEAK, THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER

01:04:36 STORY. JONATHAN: THAT'S NEXT ON THE PROGRAM.

01:04:39 YOU'RE WATCHING BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE. ♪

01:05:28 JONATHAN: LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY, GOOD

01:05:29 MORNING. PRICE ACTION LOOKS LIKE THIS ON

01:05:32 THE S&P 500. CLOSING FRIDAY AT ALL-TIME

01:05:34 HIGHS. THIS EVENT IS THIS MORNING.

01:05:41 EQUITIES AT RECORD HIGHS.

01:05:46 >> IF THE FED IS NOT CUTTING RATES BECAUSE THE ECONOMY

01:05:48 REMAINS STRONG, I THINK THE U.S. EQUITY MARKET WILL BE PRE-MUCH

01:05:50 FINE WITH THAT. IF THE FED IS CUTTING RATES

01:05:54 BECAUSE THE ECONOMY IS VERY WEAK, THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER

01:05:58 STORY. IF THE ECONOMY DELIVERS, EARNINGS DELIVER, MARKETS CAN

01:06:01 MOVE HIGHER. JONATHAN:

01:06:07 OPPENHEIMER, THE MOST BULLISH ON THE STREET, CALLING FOR 5200

01:06:10 BY YEAR-END. LISA:

01:06:18 MIKE WILSON OVER THE WEEKEND WAS TALKING ABOUT WHY HE

01:06:20 DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME KIND OF CONVICTION.

01:06:22 HE TALKED ABOUT THE FICTION OF THE BROADENING OUT.

01:06:26 HE WROTE SO FAR IN 2024, THE LAGGARDS OF TURNING 23 ARE BACK

01:06:28 TO LIGHTING AND THE WINNERS ARE BACK TO WINNING.

01:06:30 WHEN IN DOUBT, IT PAYS TO GO WITH THE HIGHEST MOBILITY

01:06:33 WINNER. IN THIS CASE, IT'S HIGH-QUALITY

01:06:34 GROWTH. PUSHING BACK AGAINST THIS IDEA

01:06:37 THAT EQUAL WEIGHING IS SOMEHOW GOING TO GAIN PRECEDENTS.

01:06:40 IT'S ALL ABOUT AI. JONATHAN: WITH US OR ON THE TABLE, HEAD

01:06:45 OF U.S. TRADING STOOD A G AT CITI,

01:06:49 ALONGSIDE THE BRILLIANT BOB DIAMOND.

01:06:52 YOU TALKED ABOUT THIS FOR A LONG TIME.

01:06:57 IS THE NEW STILL GOOD? STUART: I THINK THE NEWS IS STILL GOOD.

01:07:03 STILL SITTING HERE IN JANUARY 2023, IT WOULD BE VERY

01:07:08 DIFFERENT. I THINK THERE ARE A FEW MORE

01:07:11 BLEMISHES ON THE DATA THAN WE HAVE SEEN AND THAT HAS GOTTEN

01:07:14 PEOPLE MORE CAUTIOUS ABOUT IT BUT I GENERALLY AGREE WITH THAT

01:07:16 VIEW WHICH IS 2023 IS THE PERFECT TEST CASE FOR THAT

01:07:21 LOGIC, WHICH IS YOU HAD BASIS POINTS OF CUTS PRICED AND AND

01:07:25 THOSE CUTS GOT PRICED OUT AND EQUITIES DID JUST FINE.

01:07:28 THAT IS YOUR PLAYBOOK AT IS HIGHER THAN LAST YEAR. LISA:

01:07:34 WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE PUSHBACK, THE IDEA THAT EQUAL

01:07:36 WEIGHT CAN OUTPERFORM, THAT SOME OF THE BEATEN UP STOCKS

01:07:38 CAN SHINE AGAIN? DO YOU BUY INTO THAT? STUART:

01:07:41 WE DO. WE HAVEN'T STARTED EARNINGS

01:07:46 EITHER. THE -- THE VIEW ON BROADENING

01:07:52 OUT IS THAT IT IS NOT NECESSARILY A PRICE ACTION

01:07:53 STORY AND THE IDEA IS THAT YOU HAVE BROADER EARNINGS THAT

01:07:56 ALLOWS BROADER PARTICIPATION OF THE MARKETS.

01:07:59 I THINK WE WANT TO GET THROUGH EARNINGS BEFORE WE PULL THE

01:08:00 PLUG THAT WE DO BELIEVE IN BROADENING OUT. LISA:

01:08:05 THIS IS SOME PERMIT IS GOING TO BE KEY WHEN PEOPLE WONDER WHAT

01:08:06 IS GOLDILOCKS OR NOT.

01:08:13 YOU POINT OUT THAT A NOTABLE SLOWING IN U.S.

01:08:15 LABOR DATA IS THE TRIGGER FOR YOU. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

01:08:18 WHAT IS THE TRIGGER? STUART: IT IS PAYROLLS, CLAIMS AND

01:08:23 CREDIT CARD SPENDING. IF YOU WERE TO THINK, SOFT

01:08:27 LANDING, HARD LANDING, YOUR

01:08:33 SOFT LANDING IS PAYROLL STAY -- A HARD LANDING WOULD BE

01:08:36 NEGATIVE PAYROLLS AND A GET -- AND YOU GET THE UN-UP LIMIT

01:08:38 RATE ABOVE 4.5%.

01:08:44 FRANKLY, IF WE START PREDICTING SOME 100 K JOBS, THE MARKET IS

01:08:48 GOING TO INCREASE THE PUB OF THAT DOWNSIDE. JONATHAN:

01:08:52 HOW FRUSTRATING IS THIS FOR YOU, TRYING TO WORK OUT OF GOOD

01:08:53 NEWS IS GOOD NEWS? BOB: YOU PHRASED IT PERFECTLY AND

01:08:59 STUART, THIS FITS WHAT YOU ARE SAYING.

01:09:02 IF WE GO BACK A YEAR FROM TODAY, FED FUNDS ARE ABOUT 4%

01:09:06 AND EVERY ANALYST COMING OUT HERE IS SAYING WE ARE GOING TO

01:09:07 HAVE A RECESSION. AND ACTUALLY RATES WENT UP

01:09:12 ANOTHER 150 BASIS POINTS AND THE ECONOMY IS STRONGER.

01:09:15 THIS YEAR, EVERYONE IS SAYING WE ARE GOING TO HAVE CUT AFTER

01:09:20 CUT AND I THINK WE ARE BACK TO THAT SAME POSITION WHICH IS I

01:09:24 THINK THE CONSENSUS HAS GOT IT WRONG GOING INTO THE FIRST HALF

01:09:25 OF THIS YEAR. EXPECTING MULTIPLE INTEREST

01:09:32 RATE CUTS, WHAT OUR VIEW SIMILAR TO STUART'S IS THE

01:09:36 ECONOMY HAS SOME MOMENTUM. WE'RE LOOKING AT CONTINUED

01:09:39 GROWTH THIS YEAR. IF WE GET AN ECONOMY IN THE

01:09:44 FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR GREATER THAN 1%, WHICH IS THE

01:09:47 CONSENSUS, AND THE FED HAS GOOSED THAT A BIT, I THINK THEY

01:09:49 ARE GOING TO BE IN A DIFFICULT POSITION. JONATHAN: STUART?

01:09:54 STUART: I THINK THAT'S RIGHT.

01:10:01 I THINK OUR VIEW ON THIS WOULD GENERALLY BE THAT THE MARKET IS

01:10:05 TAKING AWAY FROM THE FED AND THE FED IS GOING TO SAY THEY'RE

01:10:08 NOT COMING NEXT AND THEY ARE PRICING A PROBABLY STICK

01:10:10 OUTCOME. THE MARKET MIGHT EXPECT TWO

01:10:17 WITH WHAT IF WE HAVE TO GET EIGHT BECAUSE THE ECONOMY IS

01:10:20 WEAK? THE AMOUNT OF CUTS PRICED IN

01:10:25 DOES LOOK TOO AGGRESSIVE BUT IT IS THE MARKETS SAYING YOU ARE

01:10:26 DONE HIKING. THE NEXT MOVE IS A CUT AND NOW

01:10:30 WE ARE JUST SORT OF MOBILITY ADJUSTING.

01:10:32 THE MARKET IS GOING TO HAVE TO I JUST THAT -- ADJUSTMENT.

01:10:38 -- HAVE TO ADJUST THAT. LISA: THIS IDEA THAT A LOT OF THE

01:10:43 BEATEN UP STOCKS INCLUDING REGIONALS CAN REALLY SHINE THIS

01:10:44 YEAR. STUART: IF I THINK BACK TO LAST MARCH,

01:10:49 OUR VIEW ON REGIONALS WAS UNTIL PRIVATE CAPITAL INVEST IN THESE

01:10:53 THINGS WE ARE GOING TO REMAIN PRETTY CAUTIOUS.

01:10:57 IF HE IS PUTTING MONEY AND WITHOUT A GOVERNMENT BACKSTOP,

01:10:58 THEN I'M ALL IN. WE DO BELIEVE IN THE BROADENING

01:11:00 OUT. REGIONALS AND SMALL-CAP, YOU'RE

01:11:04 GOING ALL THE WAY TO THE EDGE. OUR VIEW ON REGIONALS WOULD BE,

01:11:11 IF YOU GET INSURANCE CUTS, REGIONALS ARE GOING TO

01:11:12 ABSOLUTELY RIP BECAUSE THAT MEANS YOU'VE GOT STRONG GROWTH

01:11:15 WHICH THE REGIONALS WANT AND NEED, AND YOU'RE ARE GETTING

01:11:19 RELIEF ON THE RATES SIDE. IF YOU THREAD THAT NEEDLE,

01:11:21 REGIONALS QUITE RIGHT INTO THAT. WE ARE A LITTLE MORE CAUTIOUS

01:11:23 NOW. WE ARE STAYING WITH EQUAL WEIGHT S&P AND WE HAVE SEEN

01:11:29 THIS PUSHBACK. SMALL-CAP HAS A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:11:33 OF THAT RECESSION, CYCLICAL RISK AND A LITTLE MORE RATES

01:11:38 RISK. WE FEEL LIKE THERE WAS A BIG

01:11:41 ENOUGH OPPORTUNITY THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO TAKE THAT

01:11:44 ADDITIONAL STEP, BUT IF WE GET INSURANCE CUTS, -- LISA: I DO

01:11:48 HAVE TO SAY, YOU'VE BEEN BEHIND SOME PRETTY BOLD CALLS, BOB.

01:11:53 ALSO EU OVER U.S. BANKS WHICH IS SACRILEGE.

01:11:58 WHY IS THIS YEAR GOING TO MAKE SENSE? BOB:

01:12:03 SINCE 2008, WHEN THE U.S. -- AND EUROPE AND THE U.K.

01:12:08 DECIDED THAT BIBLICAL JUSTICE TO DESTROY THE BANKS WAS THERE

01:12:11 MODE, THE U.S. BANKS HAVE JUST RIPPED AND THE

01:12:13 EUROPEAN BANKS HAVE REALLY STRUGGLED.

01:12:18 I THINK FOR THE FIRST TIME, IF I COULD SAY IT DIFFERENTLY, I

01:12:21 AM LESS BEARISH ON EUROPEAN BANKS RELATIVE TO U.S.

01:12:24 BANKS FOR THE FIRST TIME, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT UBS AND TWO

01:12:30 BANKS AS AN EXAMPLE, I'M NOT SAYING ACROSS THE INDUSTRY,

01:12:34 THEY HAVE RETURN ON EQUITY, RETURN ON TANGIBLE EQUITY ABOVE

01:12:37 15%. THEY ARE LOOKING. A LOT MORE LIKE U.S. BANKS.

01:12:40 THEY HAVE VERY STRONG LEADERSHIP.

01:12:43 THEY HAVE STRONG WEALTH PLATFORMS. THEY HAVE INVESTMENT

01:12:46 BANKS THAT ARE QUITE PROFITABLE. NOT TRYING TO BEAT U.S.

01:12:51 BANKS BUT VERY SIMILAR TO THE WAY WE BUILT IT AT BARCLAYS

01:12:53 WITH BARCLAYS CAPITAL.

01:12:59 IF YOU LOOK AT UPS -- UBS, THEY ARE GOING TO PERFORM QUITE WELL

01:13:00 COMPARED TO U.S. BANKS. PART OF THAT IS THE VALUATION

01:13:02 SPREAD. PART OF THAT IS THEY ARE PERFORMING A LOT MORE LIKE U.S.

01:13:06 BANKS. STUART, YOU'LL RECOGNIZE THIS I

01:13:10 THINK. RATES ARE GOING TO STAY HIGHER

01:13:17 LONGER IN EUROPE THAN IN THE U.S. BECAUSE THE U.S.

01:13:19 ECONOMY, WE ARE PRETTY POSITIVE ON.

01:13:22 WE DON'T HAVE THAT FEELING ON EUROPE AT THE EUROPEAN BANKS

01:13:24 CAPTURE THAT INTEREST RATE DIFFERENTIAL.

01:13:27 AT A BETTER LEVEL THAN THE U.S. BANKS FOR ALL KINDS OF

01:13:30 STRUCTURAL REASONS. I'M VERY MUCH LESS BEARISH.

01:13:37 JONATHAN: GOOD TO SEE YOU, STUART KAISER

01:13:40 OF CITI ALONGSIDE BOB DIAMOND. BOB DIAMOND STICKING WITH US.

01:14:02 JONATHAN: TWO WEEKS OF GAINS COMING INTO

01:14:05 MONDAY. S&P 500 CLOSING AT ALL TIMES

01:14:06 HIGHS.

01:14:15 ON THE NASDAQ 100, UP BY .25%. IF WE TURN OUR ATTENTION

01:14:21 TOWARDS BIG CAP TECH OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS. ABIGAIL:

01:14:24 CAN THE BROADENING OUT CONTINUE? PEOPLE TALK ABOUT WHERE THE

01:14:27 PROFITS ARE GOING TO COME FROM. IF YOU LOOK AT THE

01:14:33 PROFITABILITY OF THE MAG SEVEN, THEY ARE EXPECTING 40% INCREASE

01:14:34 IN PROFITS YEAR-OVER-YEAR. SOMETHING INSIDE.

01:14:40 CAN THEY LEAD AS EVERYTHING A SLIDES BEHIND? JONATHAN:

01:14:43 EVEN WITH THESE LEVELS ACHIEVED IN THE BOND MARKET, WE HAD LAST

01:14:51 WEEK ON A TWO-YEAR, 24 BASES POINT MOVE HIGHER.

01:14:56 EQUITY PERFORMANCE WASN'T DECENT IN THE FACE OF A

01:15:00 TREASURY MARKET SELLOFF OFF THE BACK OF DATA OUT OF AMERICA

01:15:01 LAST WEEK. LISA: THAT IS WHAT EVERYONE KEEPS

01:15:03 SAYING. IT MATTERS WHY RATES ARE GOING

01:15:06 UP. IF THEY ARE GOING UP BECAUSE IT

01:15:11 IS A CONTROLLED INCREASE, IT IS NOT WHIPPING AROUND BY 20 BASIS

01:15:13 POINTS EVERY COUPLE OF HOURS, A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN LEAD INTO

01:15:14 RISK. THERE HAS TO BE A BREAKPOINT

01:15:21 WHERE PEOPLE HAVE TO REPRICE SOME EVALUATIONS IF FIELDS GET

01:15:22 MATERIALLY HIGHER. JONATHAN: LET'S FINISH ON

01:15:27 FOREIGN-EXCHANGE AND TAKE A SNEAK PEEK OF WHAT IS HAPPENING

01:15:29 IN AFFECTS WITH EURO AGAINST THE DOLLAR. UNCHANGED AT 1.09.

01:15:34 WE JOKED ABOUT HOW ANY TIMES WE HAVE HEARD FROM CHRISTINE

01:15:36 LAGARDE. THE PUSHBACK WE SAW POLITICALLY

01:15:43 FROM A CENTRAL BANK PRESIDENT LAST WEEK AGAINST WHAT WAS

01:15:46 HAPPENING POLITICALLY, NOT IN EUROPE, BUT IN AMERICA OVER THE

01:15:48 NEXT 10 MONTHS, 11 MONTHS. LISA: TALKING ABOUT HOW IT IS GOING

01:15:52 TO BE REALLY NEGATIVE FOR THE EURO REGION OF DONALD TRUMP

01:15:55 BECOMES THE U.S. PRESIDENT AGAIN.

01:15:57 THERE IS THIS QUESTION OF HOW MUCH OF THIS IS A POLICY ISSUE

01:15:59 THAT HAS TO DO WITH INVESTING IN EUROPE AND RIGHTSIZING

01:16:02 TECHNOLOGICAL INVESTMENTS, ETC. IT DOES RAISE A QUESTION -- HOW

01:16:07 SHE IS GOING TO FRAME THIS IN A PRESS CONFERENCE.

01:16:11 INEVITABLY, SOMEONE IS GOING TO ASK HER ASIDE FROM RATE CUTS,

01:16:13 WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT AND HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO A POTENTIAL

01:16:16 POLICY UNCERTAINTY IN THE U.S.? JONATHAN:

01:16:18 SHE IS GOING TO SAY IT IS ABOUT MONETARY POLICY TODAY.

01:16:21 I THINK IT IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT.

01:16:24 I WANT TO GO HOW WE STARTED IN THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM.

01:16:28 WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT HOW BROKEN THE EUROPEAN MODEL WAS,

01:16:32 THE DEPENDENCE ON ENERGY FROM RUSSIA, GROWTH ON CHINA AND

01:16:33 DEFENSE FROM THE UNITED STATES. WE SAW A LOT OF LEADERS COME

01:16:39 OUT, THE DUTCH PRIME MINISTER US IN SWITZERLAND SAYING THAT

01:16:41 FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS RIGHT.

01:16:45 ON NATO, WE HEARD FROM EMMANUEL MACRON.

01:16:50 WE NEED A SOVEREIGN EUROPE -- I WOULD SAY THEY ARE ON BOARD

01:16:52 WITH THE IDEA, THINGS ARE BROKEN AND WE NEED TO DO THINGS

01:16:54 ABOUT IT. LISA: THEY ARE LOOKING INTERNALLY AT

01:16:58 THE SOVEREIGN MARKET.

01:17:01 >> HE IS RATCHETING UP THAT CONCERN WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT

01:17:03 POTENTIALLY TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND CHRISTINE LAGARDE FOR

01:17:06 ONE WEEK TALKED ABOUT TRUMP WITH FRANCINE LACQUA WHEN

01:17:11 FRANCINE ASKED, I'M GOING TO NEED COFFEE TO TALK ABOUT THIS

01:17:13 AND SHE ENDED SAYING, IT IS TIME FOR EUROPE TO GO ON THE

01:17:16 PROTECT -- ON THE ATTACK TO PREPARE FOR A SECOND TRUMP TERM.

01:17:20 JONATHAN: LET'S GET TO TOP STORIES.

01:17:23 UNDER SURVEILLANCE, THE RACE FOR THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION

01:17:27 DOWN TO. FLORIDA GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS

01:17:29 ENDING HIS CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT AND ENDORSING DONALD

01:17:30 TRUMP. TRUMP NOW SET TO GO HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH NIKKI HALEY.

01:17:37 IT IS THE LAST REMAINING GOP CANDIDATE. ANNMARIE:

01:17:40 THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE PLACE NIKKI HALEY COULD

01:17:43 POTENTIALLY BREAK OUT. THIS CNN POLL YESTERDAY THAT

01:17:46 DROPPED, HE IS AT 50% NEW HAMPSHIRE.

01:17:49 THE QUESTION BECOMES, IF SHE DOES NOT COME CLOSE TO THAT OR

01:17:51 WHEN NEW HAMPSHIRE, WINDOWS NIKKI HALEY DROPOUT? LISA:

01:17:54 WHY DOES THE MARKET CARE? I KEEP WONDERING HI -- WHY

01:17:58 PEOPLE PRICE THIS OUT. WE HEARD FROM A WHOLE HOST OF

01:18:02 EXECUTIVES WAS, WE KNOW WHAT WE ARE GOING TO GET FROM JOE BIDEN.

01:18:06 THE UNCERTAINTY IS WE DO NOT KNOW FROM DONALD TRUMP.

01:18:10 A LOT OF THEIR TRADE POLICIES ARE SIMILAR AND THERE IS A

01:18:13 QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER IT WOULD BE THE SAME ON POLICIES THAT

01:18:14 ARE MOST IMPORTANT MARKETS. JONATHAN:

01:18:19 PAUL DIAMOND -- WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING OR WERE TO MOST?

01:18:22 YOU HAVE SEEN A FEW OF THESE ELECTORAL CYCLES.

01:18:24 HOW DIFFERENT IS THIS ONE FOR YOU?

01:18:26 >> I THINK IT IS NOT THAT DIFFERENT WHEN YOU STEP BACK

01:18:34 AND LOOK AT HOW THIS ELECTION IS PLAYING OUT FROM AN

01:18:35 INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE. KIND OF APROPOS FROM WHAT YOU

01:18:40 ARE SAYING ABOUT CHRISTINE LAGARDE OR MACRON OR THE NUMBER

01:18:43 OF PEOPLE YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN IN DAVOS LAST WEEK.

01:18:47 I THINK THERE IS A SURPRISE. ARE THESE REALLY THE TWO

01:18:50 CANDIDATES? IS THERE NO MORE CHANGE IN THIS?

01:18:56 I THINK THAT HAS BEEN FAIRLY CONSISTENT OVER THE LAST NUMBER

01:19:00 OF ELECTIONS, WHERE IT HAS BEEN THE STANDARDBEARERS COMING OUT.

01:19:04 I DO THINK THERE IS A DISAPPOINTMENT, AS NOT THAT

01:19:08 THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING, BUT I DO THINK THAT

01:19:13 THERE IS A NEGATIVE SURPRISE INTERNATIONALLY TO THESE TWO

01:19:14 CANDIDATES. JONATHAN: YOU MENTIONED EUROPE VERSUS THE

01:19:19 UNITED STATES BEFORE THE COMMERCIAL BREAK.

01:19:21 HOW RELEVANT IS IT NOW? BOB: THE MORE YOU RESEARCH THE

01:19:26 IMPACT OF ELECTIONS ON THE MARKETS, THE MORE YOU REALIZE

01:19:27 THERE IS NOT ONE. AND, IT IS NOT VERY RELEVANT,

01:19:32 JONATHAN. I HAVE BEEN TRAINED IN THAT WAY

01:19:38 BY LARRY CANTOR, OUR STRATEGIST AND OTHER PEOPLE.

01:19:41 YOU GO BACK THROUGH THE RECORDS -- WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE

01:19:44 ELECTION DOES NOT HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON THE MARKETS.

01:19:47 WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE IS THE MARKETS ARE JUST

01:19:51 DISCOUNTING THIS BEFORE WE START TO CONSIDER IT.

01:19:56 FROM OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGY, THERE IS VERY LITTLE IMPACT ON

01:19:58 WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE ELECTION. JONATHAN:

01:20:00 THAT IS THE DOMESTIC STORY. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE

01:20:02 INTERNATIONAL ONE. WHITE HOUSE WANTING HOUTHI

01:20:07 ATTACKS TO STOP IMMEDIATELY.

01:20:15 IN THE LATEST EFFORTS TO STOP THE REBEL ATTACKS, PRESIDENT

01:20:17 BIDEN'S DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR TELLING ABC

01:20:20 THEY WILL TAKE TIME TO PLAY OUT AND THEY WILL "HAVE MORE TO SAY

01:20:21 ABOUT IT SOON." CAN YOU TRY AND MAKE SENSE OF

01:20:25 THE COMMUNICATION ON THIS VERY ISSUE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION

01:20:28 OVER THE LAST WEEKEND? ANNMARIE: YOU SAID IT BEST WHEN BIDEN WAS

01:20:32 SAYING THE QUITE APART OUT LOUD. THE WHO THESE WILL CONTINUE

01:20:35 STRIKES. THE STRIKES ARE GOING AFTER

01:20:36 THEIR MATERIAL TO STRIKE THE RED SEA.

01:20:39 THEY ARE NOT GOING AFTER LEADERSHIP OR SOMETHING THAT

01:20:40 COULD POTENTIALLY PUT AN END TO THIS.

01:20:43 THEY ARE TRYING TO DEGRADE THE WHO THE'S -- HOUTHI'S ACTION

01:20:49 WITHOUT SPREADING WIDER CONFLICT. LISA:

01:20:52 I DO NOT KNOW HOW THIS IS PRICED INTO CORPORATE EARNINGS.

01:20:56 THIS IDEA THAT THE FREEDOM OF THE SEA IS BEING CHALLENGED IN

01:21:00 A MATERIAL WAY, THAT THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE LONGER

01:21:02 ROOTS. THAT IS GOING TO PACK IN LONGER

01:21:03 TIMES FOR DELIVERY, AS WELL AS MORE GAS.

01:21:06 THIS SEEMS LIKE IT SHOULD BE HITTING THINGS MUCH MORE

01:21:09 DIRECTLY. MIKE WORTH OF CHEVRON POINTING

01:21:11 OUT HE IS SURPRISED OIL PRICES HAVE NOT RESPONDED MORE TO THIS

01:21:14 AND GOING FORWARD, HE IS EXPECTING IF THERE IS SOME KIND

01:21:16 OF INCREASED ALTERCATION, PRICES TO GO BACK TO $100 A

01:21:18 BARREL. JONATHAN: THE PROSPECT OF GOODS INFLATION

01:21:25 RETURNING, WE WILL CATCH UP WITH SET FROM MORGAN STANLEY IN

01:21:26 THE NEXT HOUR TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THESE ISSUES.

01:21:30 MACY'S REJECTING A 5.8 BILLION OTHER TAKE OVER FROM INVESTORS,

01:21:33 CLAIMING THE OFFER LACK COMPELLING VALUE.

01:21:38 THE OFFER REPRESENTING A ROUGHLY 19% PREMIUM TO MACY'S

01:21:42 LAST CLOSING PRICE, BUT THE RETAILER SAYING THE INVESTORS

01:21:46 FAIL TO CONCERN -- TO ADDRESS CONCERNS OVER THEIR ABILITY TO

01:21:47 FINANCE THE TRANSACTION. LISA: THIS HIGHLIGHTS IF YOU GET

01:21:52 LOWER RATES, DO YOU GET MORE M AND A? TAKE A STEP BACK, IT IS

01:21:56 BASICALLY YOU CAN MAKE HIGH PROPOSALS.

01:22:00 WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO GET THE CAPITAL, ESPECIALLY GIVEN WHERE

01:22:01 PRICES ARE RIGHT NOW? IF YOU DO NOT HAVE VIABILITY,

01:22:06 WHY SHOULD YOU ACCEPT THAT TAKEOVER IF IT CAN DRAG YOU

01:22:07 THROUGH THE MUD? JONATHAN: WHICH ONE WAS IT?

01:22:13 WAS IT THE VIABILITY OF THE CAPITAL OR THE PRICE THEY WERE

01:22:14 OFFERING? LISA: RIGHT. AT A CERTAIN POINT, IT IS

01:22:19 PROBABLY THE PRICE BECAUSE IT ALWAYS COMES DOWN TO PRICE.

01:22:23 IF THEY ARE OFFERING A PRICE THAT CAN'T COME THROUGH ON IT,

01:22:25 THEN IT IS A WHOLESALE DISASTER. WHETHER IT IS WANTING TO LET GO

01:22:30 AND NOT CANNIBALIZE THE REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO IS ANOTHER

01:22:31 DEBATE. JONATHAN: CAN WE TALK ABOUT CAPITAL

01:22:34 AVAILABILITY? WE HAVE SEEN ISSUES IN THE

01:22:37 CAPITAL MARKET MARKET BACKED UP BY DEMAND.

01:22:40 HOW AVAILABLE IS CAPITAL CURRENTLY? BOB:

01:22:44 AS ALWAYS, WHAT I AM GOING TO SAY IS WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT

01:22:46 FOR THE RIGHT IDEA. THERE IS CAPITAL.

01:22:56 WE GO BACK TO THE CREDIT MARKETS, I THINK THE

01:23:00 EXPECTATION -- NOT THAT THERE IS CUTS, NECESSARILY, BUT AT

01:23:04 THE FED IS FINISHED, HAS CREATED A REAL OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:23:06 THE ISSUANCE OF CREDIT. JONATHAN:

01:23:09 ISSUANCE THROUGH THE ROOF OVER THE LAST MONTH OR SO. LISA:

01:23:14 IT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE BUSIEST JANUARY OR MORE THAN A DECADE

01:23:18 AS PEOPLE TRY TO COME BACK AND GET THEIR CAPITAL UP-TO-DATE.

01:23:22 I DO WONDER, WHETHER THIS IS PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN HOLDING

01:23:25 OFF WHO NOW HAVE CERTAINTY THAT RATES ARE GOING DOWN AND THEY

01:23:27 HAVE CERTAINTY OF THEIR BUSINESSES, OR IF THIS IS

01:23:29 PEOPLE HOLDING OUT FOR AS LONG AS THEY CAN AND NOW THEY HAVE

01:23:30 TO REFINANCE. I WONDER IF YOU GET MORE OF

01:23:34 THAT DOWN THE LINE WITH COMPANIES WITH LET'S -- WITH

01:23:39 LESS SECURE BUSINESS MODELS, DO YOU HAVE LESS RECONSTRUCTION

01:23:42 BECAUSE SPREADS ARE IN? JONATHAN:

01:23:44 WE TALKED ABOUT THAT LAST WEEK. THE HOPE IS THAT ULTIMATELY,

01:23:48 RATES COME DOWN. I GUESS WE WILL SEE. LISA:

01:23:51 I'M WONDERING HOW MANY ZOMBIES ARE GOING TO COME OUT OF THE

01:23:56 WOODWORK. TOM WITH HIS ZOMBIE ROLLUP,

01:23:58 THERE IS THIS QUESTION OF THERE ARE COMPANIES THAT WERE

01:24:01 SUSTAINED BY ZERO RATE POLICIES. YOU HAD 5% HIGH-YIELD BOND

01:24:06 YIELDS ALL IN YIELDS, NOW YOU ARE LOOKING AT 10%.

01:24:09 IS IT VIABLE FOR A LOT OF THESE COMPANIES? THE ANSWER IS NO.

01:24:12 MAYBE THEY WILL BE A LOT LOWER. SURVIVAL UNTIL 25 CONTINUED TO

01:24:16 THIS DAY. JONATHAN:

01:24:22 I LOVE THAT PHRASE, SURVIVE UNTIL 25.

01:24:25 LET'S GET YOU SOME HEADLINES FROM STORIES ELSEWHERE THIS

01:24:27 MORNING. DANI: THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL

01:24:32 PRIMARY IS NOW DOWN TO TWO CANDIDATES.

01:24:34 FLORIDA GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS DROPPED OUT ON SUNDAY, GIVING

01:24:39 -- LEAVING NIKKI HALEY AND DONALD TRUMP TO BATTLE IN NEW

01:24:40 HAMPSHIRE TOMORROW. DESANTIS ENDORSED THE FORMER

01:24:44 PRESIDENT. MACY'S WALKING AWAY FROM A $5.8

01:24:48 BILLION TAKEOVER BID. A DEAL WAS OFFERED THAT

01:24:54 REPRESENTS A 19% PREMIUM TO THE CLOSE ON FRIDAY.

01:24:59 MACY'S BOARD DECLINED TO PROVIDE DUE DILIGENCE.

01:25:03 ARC HOUSE SAYS IT IS HIGHLY MOTIVATED TO MAKE A DEAL.

01:25:09 SHARES OF BOEING DROPPED AS PARTS OF ANOTHER 737 MODEL

01:25:10 PRODUCED BY THE MANUFACTURER. THE REGULATOR RECOMMENDED

01:25:14 INSPECTING THE SAME TYPE OF PLUGS THAT FAILED ON ALASKA AIR

01:25:16 FLIGHT EARLIER IN THE MONTH. BOEING SHARES HAVE FALLEN

01:25:20 ALMOST 14% SINCE THE MIDAIR BLOWOUT OF THE 737 MAX NINE.

01:25:24 THAT IS YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF. JONATHAN: THANK YOU.

01:25:28 NEXT, THE FED REMAINS PATIENT.

01:25:32 >> WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT TO BEGIN LOWERING RATES, I BELIEVE

01:25:35 IT CAN AND SHOULD BE LOWERED METHODICALLY AND CAREFULLY.

01:25:38 JONATHAN: THAT IS NEXT ON THE PROGRAM.

01:25:42 YOU ARE WERE URGING -- YOU ARE WATCHING BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE.

01:25:57 [LAUGHTER] JONATHAN: LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY THIS

01:26:01 MORNING. HERE IS THE PRICE ACTION ON THE

01:26:04 S&P 500 INDEX. WE ADD SOME WEIGHT TO IT IS

01:26:06 MORNING. POSITIVE BY 0.4%.

01:26:10 UNDER SURVEILLANCE THIS MORNING, THE FED REMAINS

01:26:15 PATIENT. [VIDEO CLIP]

01:26:17 >> WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT TO BEGIN RATES, I BELIEVE IT CAN

01:26:19 AND SHOULD BE LOWERED METHODICALLY AND CAREFULLY WITH

01:26:23 ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND LABOR MARKETS IN GOOD SHAPE AND

01:26:29 INFLATION COMING DOWN GRADUALLY TO 2%, I SEE NO REASON TO MOVE

01:26:33 AS QUICKLY OR AS RAPIDLY AS IN THE PAST. JONATHAN:

01:26:35 THAT IS THE LATEST FROM FED GOVERNOR CHRISTOPHER WALLACE

01:26:37 SPEAKING TO THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTE LAST WEEK.

01:26:39 I DID NOT HEAR THE MONTH OF MARCH FROM ANY FED OFFICIAL

01:26:42 OVER THE LAST WEEK. LISA: THEY ALL TRIED TO PUSH BACK AND

01:26:45 THIS WHOLE IDEA THIS TIME IS GOING TO LOOK AT FRONT JUST

01:26:49 BECAUSE INFLATION IS STRUCTURALLY HIGHER, THERE IS

01:26:51 NO NEED TO CUT RATES TO MEDICALLY.

01:26:54 YOU ARE SEEING A DIP, THE DIP BEING THE BOND MARKET SELLING

01:26:55 OFF.

01:27:04 THE HEAD OF MACRO STRATEGY AT MORGAN STANLEY, THIS IS THE DIP

01:27:06 WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING TO BUY. WE SEE DOWNSIDE RISKS TO U.S.

01:27:12 ACTIVITY DELIVERED IN FEBRUARY. BLAME THE WEATHER, BLAME THE

01:27:16 FACT YOU HAVE PERHAPS LESS FISCAL SUPPORT, BUT MAYBE THE

01:27:17 DATA IS GOING TO TURN ACCORDING TO HIM. JONATHAN:

01:27:22 FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT J.P.

01:27:25 MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT, GOOD MORNING.

01:27:28 WE ARE CLOSING THAT GAP WITH MARKET COMING UP TO THE FED, OR

01:27:30 DO YOU SEE THE FED COMING DOWN TO THE MARKET SOON?

01:27:33 >> WE ARE CLOSING THAT GAP, BUT I DO NOT VIEW THE GAP AS THAT

01:27:38 WHITE. WALLER WAS MAY BE PUSHING BACK

01:27:40 ON THE TIMING, BUT I THINK HE WAS MAINLY PUSHING BACK ON THIS

01:27:45 IDEA OF VERY AGGRESSIVE CUTS. IF YOU REMEMBER ON THE WAY UP,

01:27:49 WE WERE HIKING 75 BASIS POINTS A CLIP.

01:27:52 BUT HE WAS TRYING TO PUSH BACK ON WAS ON THE WAY DOWN, THIS IS

01:27:57 GOING TO BE MUCH MORE GRADUAL AND METHODICAL.

01:27:59 DO NOT EXPECT US TO BE CUTTING AS FAST AS WE WERE HIKING

01:28:04 BECAUSE WE ARE NOT IN AN EMERGENCY ENVIRONMENT.

01:28:06 WE ARE IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE LABOR MARKET IS STILL

01:28:08 HEALTHY, INFLATION IS COMING DOWN.

01:28:10 THE JUSTIFIES CUTS PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE ON THE FOMC IF YOU

01:28:14 LOOK BACK AT THE DOT PLOT ONLY TO SHOW THE FED FUNDS RATE

01:28:17 UNCHANGED BY THE END OF THE YEAR.

01:28:20 EVERYONE IS IN CONSENSUS THERE. IT IS ABOUT THE SPEED.

01:28:24 I DO NOT SEE A HUGE GAP BETWEEN THE MARKET AND WHAT THE FED

01:28:27 ULTIMATELY WANTS TO DO. LISA: SO YOU THE FATE CUT IS STILL

01:28:32 PLAUSIBLE. JONATHAN: IT IS STILL PLAUSIBLE. KELSEY:

01:28:36 IT IS STILL PLAUSIBLE. AS YOU PUSH BACK ON MARCH, THAT

01:28:40 IS ONE LESS MEETING THAT CAN BE ACHIEVED.

01:28:43 I LOOK AT THE PATH OF THE FED FUNDS RATE NOT JUST OVER THE

01:28:46 CALENDAR YEAR OF 2024 BECAUSE WE GET OBSESSED WITH THESE

01:28:48 CALENDAR YEARS AND I LOOK AT WHERE IS THE FED FUNDS RATE

01:28:50 FROTHING AT. IT IS DROPPING AT 3.3%, THE

01:28:55 BOTTOM IN WHICH THE MARKET IS PRICING THE FED FUNDS RATE TO

01:28:56 GET TO. THAT IS A REASONABLE EASING

01:29:00 CYCLE. IT IS AN EASING CYCLE THAT IS

01:29:04 STILL CONSISTENT WITH SOFT LANDING PRICING. LISA:

01:29:07 WHAT I AM STRUGGLING WITH IS THE INCONSISTENCY WITH THIS

01:29:10 IDEA OF RATE CUTS, AGGRESSIVE OR NOT, GRADUAL, SURE, BUT RATE

01:29:15 CUTS THAT WITH AN ECONOMY MOVING AS ROBUSTLY AS WE KEEP

01:29:16 HEARING. IS THAT DISSIDENT FOR YOU, OR

01:29:19 DOES THAT MAKE SENSE? KELSEY: SO, I THINK THE ECONOMY DOES

01:29:25 NEED TO MODERATE FOR THE FED TO CONTINUE TO HAVE CONFIDENCE

01:29:27 THAT INFLATION IS GOING TO BE SUSTAINABLY AT 2%.

01:29:32 THIS IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A SITUATION WHERE INFLATION

01:29:35 TOUCHES DOWN TO 2% AND TAKES BACK OFF.

01:29:37 THIS NEEDS TO BE AN EXTENDED STAY AT 2%.

01:29:39 THE WAY THEY GET CONFIDENCE AND THAT IS THAT THE LABOR MARKET

01:29:42 COOLS ENOUGH. I THINK UNDER THE SURFACE, THE

01:29:44 LABOR MARKET IS COOLING. IF YOU LOOK AT PRIVATE PAYROLLS

01:29:50 AND STRIP OUT GOVERNMENT HIRING, WHICH TENDS TO

01:29:52 ACCELERATE IN THE LATE CYCLE WHICH IS SOMETHING WE HAVE SEEN

01:29:55 TIME AND TIME AGAIN AND YOU TAKE OUT EDUCATION AND HEALTH

01:30:00 CARE, WE ARE GRINDING DOWN TO NEARLY ZERO ON PRIVATE PAYROLLS

01:30:03 GROWTH WHEN YOU EXCLUDE THOSE CATEGORIES.

01:30:05 I THINK THINGS ARE SOFTENING. WE NEED TO BE COGNIZANT OF THAT.

01:30:12 THE FACT THE FED IS CONSIDERING RATE CUTS DOES INTRODUCE A NEW

01:30:15 TAIL RISK WE WERE NOT THINKING ABOUT IN 2023, WHICH IS THE

01:30:17 RE-ACCELERATION RISK. WE ARE CAUGHT IN THE MIST OF

01:30:20 THAT. JONATHAN: WHAT ARE CLAIMS DOING FALLING

01:30:24 IF THINGS ARE SLOWING AND GETTING WEAKER? KELSEY: RIGHT.

01:30:27 THERE IS TWO DIFFERENT PIECES OF THE LABOR MARKET PUZZLE,

01:30:29 RIGHT? YOU HAVE LAYOFFS, WHICH ARE

01:30:31 STILL LOW. BUT, YOU HAVE HIRING, WHICH IS

01:30:34 SLOWING. IT MAKES SENSE. COMPANIES, HOW DO THEY BEHAVE

01:30:38 WHEN DEMAND IS MODERATING? THEY DO NOT IMMEDIATELY FIRE

01:30:41 EVERYONE. THEY FIRST START BY LOOKING TO

01:30:46 CUT BACK PEOPLE'S HOURS, WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN.

01:30:51 ALSO, MAYBE THEY DO NOT NEED TO RAISE WAGES AS MUCH AS THEY DID.

01:30:57 FIRING, THEY ARE GOING TO BE MORE HESITANT TO DO THAT

01:31:00 PARTICULARLY BASED ON HOW HARD IT WAS TO FIND THOSE PEOPLE IN

01:31:01 THE FIRST PLACE. YES, THERE IS DISSONANCE THERE.

01:31:08 THERE ARE A LOT OF DATA POINTS THAT ARE SPORADIC RIGHT NOW,

01:31:11 WHICH I THINK IS INDICATIVE OF AN INFLECTION POINT.

01:31:14 I THINK YOU SEE MORE DATA POINTING IN DIFFERENT

01:31:16 DIRECTIONS WHEN YOU ARE AT A TURNING POINT IN THE ECONOMY.

01:31:20 BASELINE, YOU NEED THE ECONOMY TOOK COOL TO GET THE FED TO CUT.

01:31:23 THAT IS OUR EXPECTATION. JONATHAN:

01:31:27 THIS IS A QUESTION FOR BUSINESS OPERATORS, THE DECISION THEY

01:31:29 HAVE TO MAKE ULTIMATELY TO HOLD TALENT.

01:31:31 DO THINK THIS LABOR MARKET, THIS CYCLE IS GOING TO BE

01:31:34 DIFFERENT TO WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN CYCLES GONE BY? BOB:

01:31:41 OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS, I THINK HIRING TALENT HAS BEEN

01:31:44 MORE CHALLENGING THEN IT HAS NORMALLY BEEN.

01:31:47 PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO FORGET THAT IMMEDIATELY.

01:31:51 I WOULD NOT HAVE THOUGHT HOARDING TALENT WOULD BE THE

01:31:55 WAY, BUT I DO THINK CUTTING TALENTED PEOPLE WOULD BE VERY,

01:31:56 VERY CHALLENGING. I DO NOT THINK THE ENVIRONMENT

01:32:01 IS CALLING FOR IT YET, NEITHER DOES KELSEY.

01:32:04 I THINK PEOPLE WILL RECALL THAT WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH PROBABLY

01:32:09 THE MOST CHALLENGING MARKET FOR HIRING TALENT SINCE COVID BEGAN

01:32:11 THAT I HAVE SEEN IN MY CAREER. LISA:

01:32:15 I AM WONDERING WHAT YOU THINK OF WHAT KELSEY WAS TALKING

01:32:18 ABOUT, GIVEN THE FACT YOU SEE ONLY TWO RATE CUTS THIS YEAR

01:32:21 MAXIMUM AND THINK THE DOES NOT HAVE ROOM CUT RATES

01:32:23 AGGRESSIVELY. WHERE DO YOU DIVERGE FROM WHAT

01:32:24 KELSEY IS SAYING? BOB: I THINK WE ARE BOTH SAYING THE

01:32:29 FED BE DATA-DEPENDENT STILL AND THAT THEY HAVE NOT MADE THEIR

01:32:35 DECISION.

01:32:36 I THINK WHERE WE WOULD AGREE, KELSEY IS AT WE HAVE SEEN THE

01:32:38 PEAK. I WOULD BRING UP TWO THINGS IN

01:32:43 TERMS OF WHY I AM PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT MORE CAUTIOUS, BUT

01:32:46 ORIGINALLY, WE ARE KIND OF THE SAME.

01:32:48 ONE, WHILE MONETARY POLICY HAS BEEN TIGHT, FISCAL POLICY IS

01:32:52 GETTING LOOSE AGAIN. WE HAVE $2 TRILLION COMING UP

01:32:55 IN SPENDING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE. I HAVE NOT HEARD ANYONE TALK

01:32:57 ABOUT THAT. I THINK THAT IS ONE THING.

01:33:03 TWO, I BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT THE FED HAS TO BE VERY, VERY

01:33:06 CONSCIENCE OF GETTING AHEAD OF THIS.

01:33:11 IF THEY CUT RATES ONCE OR TWICE AND THERE IS AN ACCELERATION IN

01:33:14 INFLATION AND THEY HAVE TO REVERSE COURSE, I THINK THAT IS

01:33:15 THE WORST POSITION FOR THE FED. ON THE OTHER HAND, IF THE

01:33:22 ECONOMY BEGINS FLOWING -- SLOWING BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT

01:33:25 CUT RATES AND THEY CUT BECAUSE THE ECONOMY IS SLOWING, THAT IS

01:33:26 THE PLAN THEY WANT. I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO BE

01:33:29 EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS. LAST THING I WOULD SAY, I AM A

01:33:32 BIT OF A HISTORIAN. I MENTIONED THE WORK I DO WITH

01:33:38 OUR OPERATING PARTNER, LARRY CANTOR, EARLIER.

01:33:41 IF YOU GO BACK THROUGH HISTORY OF THE FED, THE BAR FOR

01:33:46 REVERSING COURSE IS VERY, VERY HIGH.

01:33:48 THERE IS NO QUESTION THERE IS A PAUSE.

01:33:51 THERE IS NO QUESTION THEIR INTENTION IS TO NOT RAISE RATES

01:33:55 ANYMORE. BUT, THE ACTUAL BAR FOR REVERSAL BECAUSE OF THE SIGNAL

01:33:59 WITH REVERSAL, IS VERY HIGH. I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO BE

01:34:03 REALLY CAUTIOUS AND MY SENSE IS IT IS GOING TO BE SECOND-HALF.

01:34:05 LISA: I WANT TO FOCUS ON THE FISCAL

01:34:06 FOR A MINUTE. 162 BILLION DOLLARS OF AUCTIONS

01:34:10 THIS WEEK ALONE. TOMORROW, 5-YEAR NOTE'S

01:34:12 WEDNESDAY. 41 BILLION DOLLARS OF SEVEN

01:34:15 YOUR NOTES ON THURSDAY. KELSEY, WHEN DO PEOPLE START TO

01:34:18 CARE ABOUT THE DEFICIT AGAIN? ARE WE ONE BAD OPTION AWAY FROM

01:34:23 THIS PREMIUM BAKED INTO VALUATIONS? KELSEY:

01:34:26 I DO NOT THINK THIS IS THE WEEK. [LAUGHTER]

01:34:29 MAYBE FAMOUS LAST WORDS. WE ARE IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE

01:34:34 THERE IS DEMAND MEETING THE SUPPLY.

01:34:37 WE HAVE HAD A TWO MINUTES FEW WEEKS IN INVESTMENT-GRADE

01:34:42 CREDIT. TO SPEAK TO THE AMOUNT, THE WAY

01:34:46 THAT SENTIMENT HAS SHIFTED THE LAST 12 MONTHS, THINK ABOUT

01:34:50 REGIONAL BANKS AND THE ISSUANCE THEY HAVE DONE THE PAST WEEK.

01:34:52 THESE ARE BANKS THAT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ISSUE LAST

01:34:55 SPRING. YOU WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

01:34:57 SELL THE PAPER EVEN IF YOU TRIED. NOW, THEY'RE ISSUING WITH

01:35:00 LITTLE CONCESSION. MULTIPLE TIMES OVERSUBSCRIBED

01:35:03 ON THE BOOKS. IT HAS BEEN A LARGE SENTIMENT

01:35:05 SHIFT. I DO NOT EXPECT THAT TO CHANGE

01:35:08 ANYTIME SOON. GETTING BACK TO THIS IDEA OF

01:35:17 WHERE THIS RISK THE FED MAY BE MORE CAUTIOUS AND MORE GRADUAL,

01:35:21 I THINK THAT IS NOT A BAD ENVIRONMENT FOR FIXED INCOME

01:35:23 INVESTORS BECAUSE WHILE WE ARE WAITING FOR THEM TO DECIDE WHEN

01:35:28 THE FIRST CUT IS GOING TO COME, YOU CAN COLLECT THAT CARRIE.

01:35:31 IN THE EVENT THE ECONOMY DOES SLOW DOWN MORE, THE FED HAS

01:35:35 MORE POLICY SPACE THAN THEY HAVE HAD IN A LONG TIME.

01:35:38 THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY CUT DURING COVID, THEY CUT 200

01:35:41 BASIS POINTS BECAUSE THAT IS THE ONLY SPACE THEY HAD.

01:35:46 NOW, THEY HAVE A LOT OF POLICY SPACE.

01:35:49 THEY HAVE A LOT OF AMMUNITION TO HELP THE ECONOMY IF THINGS

01:35:51 DO SLOW. JONATHAN: YOU TALKED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL

01:35:57 OF GOING BACK TO 3.30 ON FED FUNDS.

01:35:59 WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE LONGER END OF THE CURVE?

01:36:03 WHAT I'M HEARING FROM YOU IS INVESTMENT RISK WHETHER YOU ARE

01:36:05 LOOKING AT T-BILLS, MATURING AND REINVEST IN THAT CAPITAL,

01:36:07 YOU DO NOT WANT TO MISS OUT ON THE SMOOTH FURTHER OUT THE

01:36:11 CURVE IF YOU WERE AT OR PERCENT NOW, YOU RISK THEM DROPPING TO

01:36:12 WHAT? 3%? 3.5%?

01:36:19 KELSEY: ULTIMATELY MUST VOLATILITY IN

01:36:20 THE YIELD CURVE IS DRIVEN BY THE FRONT END.

01:36:24 IT IS THE STORY OVER LONGER PERIOD SOME TIME IS THAT AS THE

01:36:28 FED IS CUTTING RATES, YOU SEE THE CURVE.

01:36:32 AS THE FED IS HIKING RATES, YOU SEE THE CURVE FLATTENING.

01:36:36 AS THE FED IS CUTTING RATES, YOU SEE THE CURVE STEEPENING.

01:36:38 WE ARE ENTERING A PERIOD WHERE THE FED IS ON PAUSE.

01:36:41 THE NEXT MOVE IS GOING TO BE A CUT.

01:36:43 IN THAT ENVIRONMENT, THE CURVE IS GOING TO BE STEEPER.

01:36:47 IN THE SHORT TERM AS MARCH IS BEING PRICED OUT IN TERMS OF

01:36:49 THE MARKET PROBABILITY, YOU COULD SEE TACTICAL FLATTENING.

01:36:53 THAT IS VERY MUCH ON THE MARGIN. IN GENERAL, OVER CYCLES IF THE

01:36:58 FED IS CUTTING RATES, YOU ARE SEEING THE CURVE STEEPEN.

01:36:59 JONATHAN: ARE YOU MORE BULLISH RIGHT NOW

01:37:02 ON TREASURIES THAN CORPORATE CREDIT? KELSEY:

01:37:06 I WOULD SAY WE ARE ACTUALLY FEELING VERY GOOD ABOUT

01:37:07 CORPORATE CREDIT, AS WELL. AS PARTICULARLY

01:37:14 INVESTMENT-GRADE AND HIGH-QUALITY, BECAUSE THAT RISK

01:37:17 REWARD WE SEE IS VERY FAVORABLE. TECHNICALS ARE A BIG PART OF

01:37:22 THAT MARKET AND WE ARE SEEING QUITE A LOT OF DEMAND COME IN.

01:37:26 I THINK THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE CONCERNED IN NOVEMBER

01:37:27 AND DECEMBER THAT THEY MISSED THE RALLY.

01:37:31 IF YOU LOOK AT HOW MUCH THE U.S. AGGREGATE WAS UP IN NOVEMBER

01:37:33 AND DECEMBER, IT WAS 8%, WHICH IS MASSIVE.

01:37:37 THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE ASKING THE QUESTION, DID THEY

01:37:38 MISS IT? THE POINT IS, ANY OF THESE

01:37:44 BACKUPS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE PEOPLE TO GET INVESTED,

01:37:47 LOCK IN YIELDS YOU HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE IN HIGH

01:37:49 QUALITY FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO IN MULTIPLE DECADES. JONATHAN:

01:37:56 KELSEY BARROW OF JP MORGAN AND BOB DIAMOND. LOCK IT IN.

01:38:01 I HAVE HEARD THAT SO MUCH OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS. LISA:

01:38:05 IF YOU ARE LOCKING IT IN RIGHT NOW, WE ARE LOOKING AT SPREADS

01:38:08 ON INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT ARE THE LOWEST GOING BACK TO

01:38:09 FEBRUARY 2022. I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU HAVE

01:38:13 MISSED IT, BUT THE IDEA OF SELLING IT OFF -- THIS IS A

01:38:14 CONFUSING MARKET. THIS IS NOT WHAT WE NORMALLY

01:38:17 EXPECT WITH CREDIT SPREADS. JONATHAN:

01:38:22 WE TALKED ABOUT THIS A LOT, THE DEMAND AT OR IS GREATER THAN

01:38:23 THE DEMAND THAT EXISTED AT FIVE. THAT IS THE WAY MARKETS WORK.

01:38:27 LISA: WHEN SOMETHING IS ON SALE, YOU

01:38:28 DO NOT WANT IT. WHEN IT IS REALLY EXPENSIVE,

01:38:32 YOU GO ALL IN. JONATHAN: THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THINGS.

01:38:35 GOOD TO SEE YOU.

01:38:41 COMING UP, ALICIA LEVINE AND SETH CARPENTER.

01:38:44 WE CATCH UP WITH KAILEY LEINZ

01:39:00 >> WE ARE VERY PLEASED WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH

01:39:01 AUTOMOTIVE. WE ARE NOW WORKING WITH

01:39:05 VIRTUALLY EVERY CAR COMPANY P THE INNOVATION, THAT IS WHAT

01:39:07 WILL DRIVE US FORWARD.

01:39:10 >> WE HAVE BETTER JOBS, BETTER ECONOMIC AND WE ARE READY FOR A

01:39:12 TURBULENT WORLD.

01:39:15 >> ENTERTAINMENT IS DOING VERY WELL.

01:39:17 WELLNESS PRODUCTS ARE DOING VERY WELL.

01:39:21 >> YOU ARE GOING TO SEE THE BANKS DO REALLY, REALLY WELL

01:39:23 AND THEY ARE GOING TO BE A WONDERFUL, PERFORMING OUTSET --

01:39:26 ASSET IN 2024.

01:39:29 >> THIS IS "BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE"

01:39:32 WITH JONATHAN FERRO, LISA BRAMO IT'S AND ANNMARIE HORDERN.

01:39:34 JONATHAN: THIS IS "BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE"

01:39:38 ALONGSIDE LISA ABRAMOWICZ TOGETHER WITH ANNE-MARIE PORTER

01:39:42 AND -- HORDE RN. YOUR EQUITY MARKET THIS MORNING

01:39:47 ADDING WEIGHT TO THAT RALLY, POSITIVE BY 0.4%.

01:39:51 LISA SAID LAST WEEK THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DOERS AND

01:39:54 THINKERS IN DUBOSE, SWITZERLAND. LISA:

01:39:56 YOU JUST HEARD THAT IN ALL OF THE INTERVIEWS THAT WE DID IN

01:40:00 TERMS OF THIS OPTIMISM AND YOU TALK TO THE THINKERS, THEY SAY

01:40:05 ABOUT -- WHAT ABOUT THE MIDDLE EAST, THE ELECTION CYCLE AND

01:40:06 THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME SLOWDOWN? WHY ARE YOU GUYS SO OPTIMISTIC?

01:40:12 I UNDERSTAND THE ANCHORS BUT THE WORDS ARE GIVING A

01:40:13 DIFFERENT STORY RIGHT NOW. JONATHAN:

01:40:16 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, HOPING THE FORMER AND

01:40:19 THE LATTER ARE WRONG. ANNMARIE: BECAUSE THE RISKS RIGHT NOW ARE

01:40:24 CONCERNING FOR THEM, GIVEN THE FACT THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT

01:40:26 PEOPLE CARE ABOUT, IT IS THE ECONOMY.

01:40:28 PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO FEEL BETTER ABOUT IT.

01:40:32 GOOD INFLATION IS COMING DOWN. COULD SOMETHING LIKE WHAT IS

01:40:37 GOING ON IN THE RED SEA UP AND THAT ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES

01:40:38 TO INFLATION? JONATHAN: WHAT IS YOUR NORTHSTAR?

01:40:42 WHAT IS GUIDING YOU? IF YOU HAD TO PICK ONE THE LAST

01:40:46 12 MONTHS, IT MIGHT BE JOBLESS CLAIMS. JOBLESS CLAIMS DROPPING

01:40:51 LAST WEEK, NOT RETAIL SALES. 187,000. LISA:

01:40:56 WE TALKED TO THE BIGGEST STAFFING FIRM GLOBALLY.

01:41:01 THEY ARE SAYING THE SAME THING, PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO GET HIRED.

01:41:04 IF THE LABOR MARKET IS GOOD AND WE ARE TALKING TO STORE KAISER,

01:41:08 THAT IS LONE STAR WHAT IS GOING TO CAUSE THINGS TO TURN THE

01:41:09 OTHER WAY? THE KICKER IS, IF THAT IS THE

01:41:15 CASE, WHY SHOULD THE FED CUT SO AGGRESSIVELY AND HAS THAT FULLY

01:41:16 BEEN PRICED INTO THE MARKET? JONATHAN:

01:41:18 GOOD NEWS IS GOOD NEWS. BASED ON THE COMMUNICATION FROM

01:41:21 THE FEDERAL RESERVE IN THE LAST WEEK, MUST BE REINFORCED BY THE

01:41:26 ECONOMIC DATA. LET'S GET TO THE PRICE ACTION

01:41:29 POSITED BY ZERO POOR -- 0.4% ON THE S&P 500.

01:41:31 IN THE BOND MARKET, YIELDS DOWN THREE BASIS POINTS.

01:41:34 CALL IT 4.1% ON A 10 YEAR. LISA: THE BIG TEST IS ON FRIDAY, WE

01:41:40 GET CORE PCE, THAT HE INFLATION METRIC THE FED LOOKS AT.

01:41:43 IF YOU SEE IT COMES IN AS AGGRESSIVELY AS PEOPLE ARE

01:41:50 EXPECTING, THEN DO YOU GET THE LEADING INTO THIS GOLDILOCKS

01:41:52 EVERYONE HAS BEEN PLAYING INTO AND IT STARTS TO BROADEN OUT TO

01:41:54 NVIDIA? JONATHAN:

01:42:00 COMING UP, 90 MINUTES AWAY UNTIL THE OPENING BELL WITH

01:42:01 STOCKS SITTING AT ALL-TIME HIGHS.

01:42:04 WE TALKED LOTS ABOUT FINANCIALS THE PAST FEW WEEKS.

01:42:06 WALL STREET IS DONE. WE TALK ABOUT BIG TECH.

01:42:11 MICROSOFT AND APPLE IN EARLY FEBRUARY.

01:42:13 PRESIDENT BIDEN GETTING HIS WISH, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE

01:42:15 BEGINNING TO BOUNCE. DID NIKKI HALEY GET HER WISH

01:42:18 OVER THE WEEKEND? ANNMARIE:

01:42:19 IT DEPENDS ON WHERE THIS 5% THAT IS SANTA'S WAS POLLING IN

01:42:24 NEW HAMPSHIRE GO. DO THEY GO TO TRUMP OR NIKKI

01:42:27 HALEY? I THINK HE DID HER A FAVOR BY

01:42:31 DROPPING OUT BEFORE BECAUSE IT GIVES HER THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:42:34 GET SOME DESANTIS VOTES. IF YOU LOOK AT POLLING OVER THE

01:42:38 WEEKEND, IT IS TRUMP'S TOLUSE. HE IS AT 50%. LISA:

01:42:44 I AM SICK OF TALKING ABOUT THIS ELECTION THAT IS STARTING.

01:42:45 JONATHAN: IT IS JANUARY. LISA: BOB DIAMOND SAID THERE IS

01:42:51 DISAPPOINTMENT IN GENERAL THAT THESE ARE THE TWO CANDIDATES

01:42:53 AND THAT MAYBE THAT IS THE RISK PEOPLE ARE LEANING INTO RIGHT

01:42:55 NOW. JONATHAN: A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE SAID,

01:42:57 COULD WE HAVE DONE BETTER THAN THIS? LISA: I KNOW.

01:43:01 IT IS THE ELECTION AMERICANS DO NOT WANT. ANNMARIE:

01:43:04 THEY DO NOT WANT THIS REMATCH, BUT IT IS THE ELECTION THAT

01:43:07 THEY ARE GOING TO GET. JONATHAN: GIVEN THERE IS BASICALLY NO

01:43:13 ENTHUSIASM TO WIN OVER THESE TWO CANDIDATES? ANNMARIE:

01:43:16 ESPECIALLY THE GROUPS THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS GOING FOR HIM.

01:43:22 THAT IS GOING TO BE A HUGE PLACE LIKE IN WISCONSIN.

01:43:26 JONATHAN: KAILEY LEINZ, WE NEED TO TALK

01:43:29 ABOUT REJECTING A $5.8 BILLION TAKEOVER.

01:43:32 MACY'S IS PUSHING BACK AND PUSHING BACK HARD. LISA:

01:43:36 IS IT BECAUSE OF VALUATION AT 19% PREMIUM OR BE BECAUSE OF

01:43:38 QUESTIONS AROUND FINANCING? THE ISSUE WITH MACY'S IS, IT

01:43:44 HAS HOPE IT CAN REGENERATE AS SOME SORT OF JUGGERNAUT OF THE

01:43:46 SHOPPING RETAIL EXPERIENCE. OTHER PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT IS A

01:43:50 REAL ESTATE SHOP THAT THEY NEED TO SELL THEIR BUSINESSES.

01:43:55 AT WHAT POINT THEY HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR POTENTIAL

01:43:56 VALUATION VERSUS THEIR EXISTING VALUATION? JONATHAN:

01:44:00 IS IT ABOUT THE EVALUATION OR THE AVAILABILITY AND CAPITAL?

01:44:02 SOUNDS LIKE THE LATTER. LISA: I WAS ABOUT TO SAY, I HAVE
