If you want to see the future of Congress, look to Minnesota.

Democrats there achieved unified government in the 2022 midterms, winning a one-seat margin in the state Senate. With it, they managed in their just-ended session to enact “nearly their entire legislative agenda,” as one local report put it. The raft of new legislation included tax increases and tax breaks; child-care funding; infrastructure spending; legalized marijuana; abortion access; gun restrictions; paid family leave; free school lunches for all; and automatic voter registration.
