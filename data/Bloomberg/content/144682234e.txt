00:07 Newsmakers and Market movers. This is the pulse with friends who like.

00:15 Well, good morning and welcome to The Pulse, everyone in Francine Lacqua here

00:18 in London with the conversations that matter.

00:21 And here's what's coming up on today's program.

00:23 US and Japanese stocks had record highs as the Fed was data showing us

00:27 underlying inflation rose in January at the fastest pace in nearly a year.

00:32 Thomas Gordon will step down as president of the Swiss National Bank

00:35 later this year, ending an era where his institution was really at the heart of

00:40 currency and banking turmoil that rippled around the world.

00:43 Plus, China's factory activity fell for the fifth time in a row as weak demand

00:48 continues to hamper the world's second largest economy.

00:51 We also preview next week's NPC meeting. But first thing is first.

00:54 So as always, let's look at the European markets map again.

00:57 The focus is firmly on what we heard in the US, so we're seeing a little bit of

01:00 a lift to a lot of these stocks. You can see the IBEX of Footsie maybe

01:03 getting within a half a percent and 8/10 of a percent.

01:07 Banking and auto shares seem to be leading the gains.

01:10 And again, this comes after the Federal Reserve preferred inflation measure,

01:14 which is personal consumption expenditure rose in January at the

01:18 fastest pace in nearly a year, but it's actually also in line with estimates.

01:23 Sentiment also got a boost from jobless claims data that indicated labour market

01:28 is softening a touch. Now Dell is also soaring premarket after

01:32 it reported a bumper sales and profit driven by the AI boom Known for its PC

01:38 business, Dell has attracted attention for its high powered servers needed to

01:42 run AI systems. However, Dell says like many in the

01:46 industry, the business is being held back by the availability of advanced

01:50 computer chips. You can see pre market Dell 21% higher.

01:54 Commercial real estate lender New York Community Bank Corp said it discovered

01:58 material weaknesses in how it tracks loan risks wrote down the value of

02:03 companies acquired years ago and replaced its leadership to grapple with

02:07 the turmoil. Well, Alexandra de Mello is to succeed

02:10 Thomas Kean as the firm's chief executive.

02:13 And you can see pre-market New York Community Bancorp down some 21.7%.

02:19 Now to talk about all of this, we're joined from Munich by David Silva.

02:23 He's chief economist at Allianz. Thank you so much for joining us.

02:27 I don't know whether there's been a change in expectations because of some

02:30 of the data that came out, that preferred inflation data out of the Fed.

02:33 But how many times are you expecting the Fed to go this year?

02:38 We. Good morning first.

02:40 I think the PC numbers confirm the CPI numbers.

02:43 Of course, it was not really a surprise. We have the Fed voting by 75 basis

02:49 points to hundred basis points this year.

02:51 So markets are catching up with us because we had this cold for over a

02:55 year. But you saw the year end rally and the

02:57 craziness about the March pivots. That would have been horrible, I would

03:01 say, for the overheating of the US economy.

03:03 So we're still quite confident that the Fed has ample room to pivot in the

03:07 second half of the year. But those numbers, you know, I think

03:10 Goldman Sachs just released their outlook saying the USA power's on.

03:14 It's incredible to see how much the US still has in terms of engines of growth

03:18 and inflation in this first half of 24. Yeah, and Ludovic, it's pretty

03:23 incredible looking at some of the metrics.

03:25 Also productivity really soaring. Is there anything that makes you uneasy?

03:29 How long can the labour market actually stay at these strengths?

03:34 Look normally election year in the US like 2016, which would be a good example

03:38 because there is a lot of uncertainty about the outcome is a muddle through

03:42 where you have some sectoral recessions in the US.

03:44 So the cyclical sectors, construction, you know, automotive are usually in down

03:48 mode and so that could trigger the end of so the so called labour hoarding that

03:53 some US firms have been doing because they were waiting for the IRA, the

03:56 inflation prediction. So we are, you know, we expect the

04:00 unemployment rate in the US to uptick to tick up a little bit towards the second

04:04 half of the year. But to be fair, it's still a very tight

04:06 labor market. You mentioned the jobless claims and

04:09 it's not something that is going to be tremendous in terms of creating the room

04:14 for even a bigger pivot from the Fed because the labour market is still very

04:16 tied to the US. I think it's very clear that today

04:21 there's one story in town, and that's the fact that the S&P president is

04:24 stepping down. We don't know who will replace him for

04:28 the moment. There is a press conference that a

04:29 little bit later on. But does that change in any way how

04:32 you're looking at Switzerland and the currency?

04:36 Look, I think, you know, I think the best year for Switzerland has been all

04:40 about financial stability. Right.

04:42 So in the end, people didn't look so much about the other losses of the S&P

04:46 that, you know, look so much at the currency, the strains of the currency or

04:48 the weakness there. But it is true that I think Switzerland

04:52 is a very important marker of this whole normalization and preventing World War

04:57 II because it's such an important safe haven for the world and is also an

05:02 important location for financial folks, for financial impetus, which has been a

05:06 bit dented by the UBS. Pretty sweet story.

05:09 So I would say, you know, of course, the next leader of the S&P is important, but

05:14 just an extent. What is more important today is that,

05:16 you know, Switzerland reassures the taxpayers that the massive quantitative

05:21 easing that has been done and given given back to shareholders, you've seen

05:24 the results, I think, in Switzerland for those results is something of the past

05:28 and that going forward is going to be even better surveillance on the on the

05:32 banking sector in Switzerland. I think that would be better for

05:34 everybody, you know, around it. As you can imagine, because of the

05:37 cross-border credit risk that still over from that that that situation.

05:43 You're like the central bank whisperer. Or so is there.

05:45 What does an S&P president need to be like?

05:49 Is it more of the same? Do you need someone more radical?

05:51 Do you need someone that focuses more on politics?

05:55 Gosh, you know, I think we live in a world

05:58 where, you know, you have to be a politician to manage the currency.

06:02 You know, central bank independence is for the books.

06:04 And I do believe that in an era where we have a lot more financial weaponization,

06:09 we see that now is the situation between the US-China rivalry, but more generally

06:14 and the situation on currency and sovereignty going back to the forefront,

06:18 I think you need someone who really understands what is the business model

06:21 and the economic model of Switzerland, which is a lot about value added exports

06:24 in a world where trade is actually quite muted.

06:27 So I do think you need someone quite political, unfortunately, but that's the

06:30 time we are in. It's the time of war economics to a

06:33 certain extent where currency is a weapon.

06:37 We also had this pretty incredible survey, actually, that Bloomberg put

06:41 together, looking at what's worse. Is it worse that the ECB actually cuts

06:46 too soon? And many responds?

06:48 A majority of respondents think it's the big, dangerous ECB cutting too soon

06:52 rather than delaying it. Do you agree with that?

06:57 I would say yes, because then it would be seen as ECB

07:04 throwing the circulation baby with the bathwater.

07:08 I think you BCB cuts too soon because of the supply side inflation risks we have

07:12 compared to the US because of the imported inflation, because of energy

07:15 inflation. If we get before the Fed, I think

07:18 markets would sanction the euro, the euro and below us very fast.

07:23 So unfortunately for financial markets and for the two reasons, I would say

07:28 that's, you know, that would be bad for the ECB to get too soon.

07:32 But of course, as you can imagine, there is a social aspect to it.

07:34 So you're in the situation of very symmetric needs there.

07:37 The Eurozone is already in a no landing zone.

07:40 You know, we expect to GDP in Q1 to be zero at best year.

07:44 So I think there is a growing rational about me extending credit into the

07:48 economy to avoid the recession and to avoid certainly something where the

07:52 European or the eurozone is really stuck in zero growth.

07:56 We've seen a bit of high inflation situation.

07:58 So it's a catch 22. I still believe cutting too soon would

08:01 be riskier in the short run because that would completely catalyze this idea of

08:07 the US overperformance and therefore sanction somehow the financial flows

08:11 into Europe. What you do with you know, there's a lot

08:16 of talk about, of course, the tightening, quantitative tightening,

08:19 which a lot of markets focus on, but we tend to ignore I mean, this is an

08:23 important component for the ECB. Yeah, but we tend to ignore till the

08:29 moment that they report the losses. And you realize that unfortunately, you

08:33 know, the balance sheet matters. I think it's very interesting that, you

08:36 know, we are normalizing rates very fast, but we're not normalizing their

08:39 balance sheet as fast. Why?

08:40 Because of fragmentation in Europe. Right.

08:43 But it's the same in the U.S. It's because of the very strong

08:47 corporate leverage and the spreads have been really low and narrow.

08:51 Right. So so I think there is this idea that

08:53 balance sheet will normalize at too much gradual pace to avoid that.

08:57 The whatever it costs that we initiated in 2020 when we were really worried

09:01 about a financial meltdown is not all for nothing.

09:04 You know, we didn't have these higher debt and higher inflation for nothing

09:07 because we would reduce the size of the balance sheet of central banks too fast.

09:11 But be careful because of course, this is a contributor, somehow even indirect

09:16 and secondary to the strong inflationary pressures that are still rampant in the

09:21 US for sure, and somehow also in some cases in in Europe.

09:25 But but I would say the pace is the right one, but it's certainly not as as

09:30 fast normalizing as it should. If we would really want to get to demand

09:34 driven inflation and all these risks around rates, price spirals and so forth

09:38 back into their box. Yeah,

09:41 we do. We think so much as always, we'll have

09:43 plenty more from you. The chief economist at Allianz, he's

09:46 coming up shortly. Now.

09:47 Also coming up, we had inflation data from three of Europe's biggest economies

09:51 yesterday. So we get the figures for the whole of

09:54 the eurozone. We look ahead to Germany.

09:56 Actually, we'll focus in on Germany. That's next.

09:58 And this is Bloomberg.

10:18 Now two stocks we need to look at premarket Dell soaring premarket after a

10:22 reported bumper sales and profit driven by the boom.

10:26 Known for its PC business, Dell has attracted attention for its high powered

10:30 servers needed to run AI systems. Now New York Community Bank Corp.

10:35 has also plunged pre-market. That's after the bank said it had

10:38 discovered material weaknesses in how it tracks loan risks.

10:42 Wrote right down, wrote down the value of companies acquired years ago and

10:45 replaced its leadership to grapple with the turmoil that you can see.

10:49 25% lower pre-market for New York Community Bancorp.

10:53 Also, euro area headline inflation data is due in less than an hour.

10:57 Investors watching the state of the continent's economy ahead of next week's

11:01 ECB rate decision. Well, our very own Zoe Shani Weiss joins

11:05 us now from Frankfurt to discuss all of this.

11:07 She's in charge, of course, of all of our central banking coverage.

11:11 Zoe, so good to speak to on TV. So we've had data out of Spain, France

11:15 and Germany already. What can we actually expect from the

11:17 wider euro area? So we get that number in about 45

11:23 minutes. A reminder, in January, euro area

11:26 inflation stood at 2.8%. Economists predict that the number for

11:30 February will be 2.5. So that's a nice slowdown that this

11:34 inflation trend that policymakers have been speaking of will be on display.

11:40 Bloomberg's economics now cast would suggest even lower would suggest 2.4.

11:45 Either way, that's not close enough to the 2% that the ECB does want to see.

11:50 But it's obviously moving in the right direction.

11:54 So you and I so have covered many, many Swiss National Bank pressers.

11:58 Big news today that the president of the S&P, Thomas Jordan, will be stepping

12:01 down after more than a decade on the job.

12:04 You understand this and me like no one else.

12:06 Where does it leave the central bank? So it's obviously quite a seismic move,

12:12 him leaving. He has been the longest serving central

12:15 bank governor in the central bank's history.

12:17 So in more than 100 years, no one ever served as long as he did.

12:20 And he was just such a towering figure within the central bank and also within

12:25 Swiss politics. Overall, Switzerland's always is about

12:28 continuity. And again, Jordan is not stepping down

12:31 overnight. He's leaving in September.

12:33 So we do have several months to go. Overall, Switzerland's continuity would

12:37 suggest that the most obvious candidate to succeed him is his vice president,

12:42 Martin Schlager. Schlager now has only been on the

12:45 rotating panel since 2022, so not even two years now.

12:51 And the third person on the governing on that governing board,

12:56 Antoine Muhtar, only started in January. So it means we will have a very new

13:01 guard there. Jordan, even before he was central bank

13:05 president, was the deputy, and before that the number three on that right

13:09 setting board. So really, he has dominated the Swiss

13:12 central bank like no other. Thank you so much.

13:17 Ocean over there in Frankfurt who leads all of our coverage of central banks.

13:21 Now, later this afternoon, we'll also be speaking to the S&P Governor Thomas

13:25 Jordan. And I think there's a little bit of a

13:27 press conference ahead of that TV interview.

13:29 Now, let's get more from our guests, the chief economist at Allianz.

13:34 The one thing that's been keeping I imagine a lot of economists up at night

13:38 is commercial real estate, especially commercial real estate in Germany.

13:41 Is Germany really now the sick man of Europe?

13:46 I don't think Germany's the sick man of Europe, but I do think that the property

13:49 sector is under a lot of duress. Everywhere we see it.

13:52 But as you can imagine, the the atomized banking structure of Germany and the

13:58 very efficient specialization, one would say, of some of these banks onto the

14:02 commercial real estate sector creates an additional layer of risk.

14:06 And I think this is something we need to monitor.

14:08 The good news, I would say, is I have the impression that there is a form of

14:11 bottoming out, mostly because demand for construction is slowing down very fast

14:16 and there are still some supply constraints.

14:18 Right. So so we see some, you know, collateral

14:21 damage, insolvencies in the construction sector.

14:23 We do see it. You've seen some some events, some some

14:26 names, single names being at risk or being singled out.

14:30 But I do think that the bigger question we need to ask is what happens to the

14:34 housing sector? Because no politician in Germany,

14:36 unions, France one, to actually support the housing sector with very strong

14:40 fiscal. And I think that's a very interesting

14:42 change of times compared to what we used to see before.

14:45 So they consider this is out of their scope.

14:47 They let the interest rate rise, do their job to please the sector, which is

14:52 a sector where leverage has been power. Grosso Quite some time.

14:55 So something to watch this real estate banking in general, I would say that

15:00 goes for the U.S., that goes for the U.K., that goes for all of Europe.

15:03 But it's true that Germany has really hit rock bottom.

15:05 And we see that in the many leading indicators of the housing sector.

15:10 But what's the possibility of this becoming a bit of the doom loop or, you

15:14 know, some kind of big credit event that shakes financial world?

15:20 To be honest, when we scan the banks, the the system and the current real

15:26 estate exposure, we end up with a very huge number of very small banks.

15:31 But as you know, if something happens, it's always how you manage it that

15:34 matters. These famous bailing bailouts type of

15:37 procedures. And that's why there is so much urgency

15:39 to get the capital Markets union going and so forth, because I think we're

15:43 going to have some of these issues popping up on credit trees and

15:46 commercial real estate. So I'm not that worried about the domino

15:50 type of situation. I would say even not at all.

15:52 But I'm still very concerned about some special names in the banking sector

15:57 where they do look for these particular balance sheets are quite strong.

16:04 Finally, what's your take on Argentina? I know you call it a catch 22.

16:10 You know, look, I was in Davos when M.J. was here, and he was like the gods of

16:14 the gods. Everybody of the libertarians attending

16:16 Davos were so fan of L.A. and it took me some time to understand

16:19 why. But I think everybody feels that

16:21 Argentina is per se, so they all want to wear some of these mandates on trying to

16:25 power show growth in Argentina on the grounds, you know, he's had quite

16:30 a few political headwinds when it comes to passing his omnibus law.

16:35 And I think the main concern for me is today there's a lot of popular support,

16:39 but the social cost of the devaluation and the fiscal consolidation en masse.

16:44 It really has a flavor of 2001 73. And so I wonder how long, you know, the

16:50 international scene is very keen of. The local people are still keen on

16:54 delay, but when their purchasing power is really going to drop by 10 to 15%.

16:58 I'm not sure he's going to still get this popular vote.

17:00 So I'm looking forward to see if he can really pass some of the massive reforms,

17:04 even if that was turned out by Congress and whether people are still with him

17:08 behind him when there is a recession in the tune of 3%, as we expect in 2014 and

17:13 inflation is too high. Right, Because it's not really getting

17:16 under control yet. So that's that's where the popular vote

17:19 keeps could be eroding. And then the, you know, the melee halo

17:23 effect could actually disappear. As always, thank you so much for joining

17:29 us. Siobhan, they're chief economist at

17:31 Allianz. Now coming up, we talk from economics to

17:35 geopolitics as dozens of Palestinians are killed.

17:38 Now a convoy of aid trucks in Gaza. President Biden says the incident will

17:42 complicate talks but remains hopeful of a cease fire.

17:46 The latest from the Middle East, next. And this is Bloomberg.

18:04 US President Joe Biden says he remains hopeful about the prospects for a

18:07 temporary pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas, but that it's unlikely

18:11 to begin by Monday as he originally sought.

18:14 And he cautioned that a deadly incident around an aid convoy in Gaza will

18:18 complicate those cease fire talks. Joining us now is Roslyn Mathison,

18:21 Bloomberg's EMEA news director. Thank you for joining us.

18:26 Is there really hope for a cease fire before Ramadan?

18:29 Well, at this point, we are running out of time.

18:31 You know, Israelis made it clear that that's their timeline as the start of

18:34 Ramadan, which is only a bit over a week away.

18:37 If they don't have a deal, then for the remaining hostages, they may feel the

18:41 need at that point to go into Rafah. But there's still no clear plan for what

18:44 happens to the Palestinians who are currently in Rafah.

18:47 Israel says they should be able to channel them north, but there's not

18:50 really a path for them to go in. As we saw from this incident yesterday,

18:55 these fatalities around this aid convoy in the north of Gaza, there's obviously

18:59 still desperate situations happening. Northern areas of Gaza, central northern

19:03 Gaza. The conditions for people there.

19:05 So where are they going to go, where they can be safe?

19:07 And that's really a question as part of this.

19:10 And now the US president saying maybe not really Monday.

19:13 They're obviously trying really hard. I mean, he had phone conversations

19:16 yesterday again with the leaders of Egypt and Qatar.

19:19 There are efforts to get some kind of cease fire in, but they are running out

19:22 of time to get it done. We're also looking at pictures in

19:26 Moscow. Alexei Navalny will be buried actually

19:28 in Moscow today. What can we actually expect?

19:31 Well, we're seeing some initial signs of that and obviously a little bit of a

19:34 crowd gathering. Russia has been cracking down on the

19:38 protest as we've seen some protests since the death of Navalny arresting

19:41 those people. So making very clear they don't want to

19:44 have a big scene today. But we are seeing some people gather.

19:48 It was very difficult for Navalny's family to get a place to even have the

19:52 funeral. They obviously want to make this into a

19:54 moment. Also, Russia clearly does not.

19:57 So it'll be interesting to see the size of the turnout, the behavior of the

20:00 police, obviously, around that. And then what happens afterwards,

20:04 because Navalny's widow, his wife, she's now trying to establish herself as that

20:09 opposition figure in the wake of her husband's death.

20:12 After this moment, what happens? Is the momentum still there for her,

20:16 particularly can she get traction inside Russia?

20:18 So in a way, to look beyond this moment, also to see what is the trajectory of

20:23 the opposition inside Russia. Vladimir Putin is going to get

20:25 re-elected in a matter of weeks. He's going to have another term.

20:28 Is there any room left for dissent inside Russia?

20:31 Rose, thanks so much as always. Roslyn Matheson there, Bloomberg's EMEA

20:35 news director. Now coming up, we're in conversation

20:38 with the chief executive of an Italian challenger bank limited as Europe's

20:42 banking sector faces a more uncertain. That's next.

20:45 And this is Bloomberg.

20:55 It's.

21:06 US and Japanese stocks hit record high as the Fed weighs data showing us

21:10 underlying inflation rose in January at the fastest pace in nearly a year.

21:16 Thomas Jordan will step down as president of the Swiss National Bank

21:19 later this year, ending an era where his institution was at the heart of currency

21:23 and banking turmoil that rippled around the world.

21:26 Plus, China's factory activity fell for the fifth month in a row as weak demand

21:30 continues to hamper the world's second largest economy.

21:33 We also have a preview of next week's NPC meeting.

21:37 Well, good morning, everyone, and welcome to The Pulse.

21:39 I'm Francine Lacqua here in London. Now, two stocks to watch out for

21:42 pre-market. First of all, dell soaring after it

21:45 reported a bumper sales and profit driven by the AI boom now known for its

21:50 PC business, Dell has attracted attention for its high powered servers

21:54 needed to run AI systems. And New York Community Bancorp has

21:58 plunged pre-market. That's after the bank said it had

22:01 discovered material weaknesses in how it tracks loan risks.

22:05 Now, it also wrote down the value of companies it acquired years ago and

22:09 replaced its leadership to grapple with the turmoil you can see in New York,

22:13 Community Bancorp down 26%, pre-market. Now, it's also shaping up to be a more

22:18 uncertain year for the banking industry as a boost from rate hikes fade, the

22:24 geopolitical risks escalate. Europe's lenders are also assessing the

22:27 risk of the troubles in commercial real estate.

22:30 So what does this mean for Challenger Bank like Italy's Liberty?

22:33 Well, Corrado Pasta, the bank's chief executive, now joins us.

22:36 Mr. President, thanks so much for joining

22:39 us. I mean, it can't be easy being a

22:41 challenger bank in these kind of environments.

22:43 It's tough out there. Interest rates, inflation, What what's

22:47 it been like? A few black swans?

22:50 Actually, Just a few. Just a few.

22:52 In the five years of our short life, we went through a number of surprises.

22:58 But year after year, without interruption, volumes have gone up.

23:03 Now we ordered 7 billion, profits have gone up without interruption.

23:07 Now we are well above €100 million profit per year, very strong growth in

23:13 revenues. That is at the end of the evidence of

23:16 what we are doing and that we are a 360 million.

23:19 Very at the same time, in situations like this one, you have to be very

23:24 careful in keeping capital strength, liquidity, strength, quality of assets,

23:33 solidity. I mean, you have to keep everything

23:35 under control while you are growing. But how much you worry, for example,

23:39 about bad loans or people not being able to repay some of the loans?

23:42 Actually, that's not an issue for the time being.

23:46 Certainly for our portfolio, we are at the we have an MP ratio of 1.2, so it's

23:51 not a problem. But at the system level we don't see for

23:54 the time being get any real increase in the deterioration of the portfolios.

24:00 That's a good sign. Probably something will happen.

24:03 But you know, especially Italian banks have really cleaned their balance sheet

24:07 in the last few years in a major way. Mr.

24:10 FOSTER How much you worry about 2024? So 2023, you could argue, is actually

24:13 quite benign right now. You have a very uncertain geopolitics

24:17 that seems, frankly, to be getting worse by the day.

24:19 Yes, you have uncertain interest rates for the moment with the economy that

24:23 could really take a downturn. Yes, you mentioned uncertainty.

24:28 And probably the main risk we have in front of us is the accumulation of

24:35 uncertainties, growth, geopolitical risk, technology, democracy, health,

24:41 everything. So that's the environment in which CEOs

24:45 have to manage their companies. I believe that we are in the zero

24:50 something level of growth, and that's not enough.

24:54 That is the main concern for me. We have to avoid a recession because

24:58 social malaise might become too high. We have to work at the same time on

25:03 productivity and on poverty, and growth is the answer to it.

25:08 So monetary policy becomes crucial. So we had a survey actually, we surveyed

25:13 economists who see one fewer cut now in 2024 than a couple of months ago.

25:18 And basically the consensus was that the ECB cutting too soon would be worse than

25:23 delaying. Do you agree with that?

25:26 I believe we should give a clear sign that monetary policy has done its job.

25:33 So maybe after that, not too many reductions, one after the other.

25:38 But let's give a clear evidence that what monetary policies could do as been

25:44 done. Now we are entering a new phase.

25:46 We have to foster growth. We have to avoid recession.

25:49 So I would really expect a clear sign in the direction as soon as possible.

25:55 Do you start worrying, actually, about consumer consumer behavior in Italy?

25:58 Do you see anything in the way that people are lending, spending, using

26:04 that's being hurt by inflation? It makes you worry about a financial

26:08 credit event happening. High yields have made investments more

26:13 difficult, and that's why I strongly suggest our government to Europe in

26:18 general to do whatever they can to reward companies that invest in

26:24 innovation, because that's crucial. I mean, for Europe, for Italy, for any

26:28 other country. So, for example, any tax advantage you

26:32 can provide to companies that invest tax credit is the main instruments.

26:37 At the same time, in my opinion, we should accelerate what they said since

26:41 five years ago. Federal investments in technology.

26:44 Europe is losing the opportunity to be part of the new world.

26:49 We are lagging behind in terms of private companies.

26:52 Yes, but you have to do what the United States have done, what China is doing at

26:57 the federal level. You have to really reward, help,

27:02 incentivize a subsidy, whatever you can do to help to encourage companies to

27:08 invest in innovation, because we are really out of the ranking as of today.

27:12 And that's a liability. That's a weakness we have to cope with.

27:16 So it is five years old. Congratulation.

27:19 Five years old. Yes.

27:19 Working on a new business plan. What will that look like?

27:23 Growth. Growth where we are at our best.

27:26 Credit to SMEs and SMEs with growth potential with the will to go through

27:34 restructuring. So these are the two main areas going

27:37 concern with ambitious projects or with the will to go through their problems.

27:44 That's really where we give our best. Less or even no direct investments in

27:49 NPL that's less interesting. It used to be part of our business is

27:53 not anymore. We concentrate on going consumer, we

27:55 concentrate on SMEs that can grow, that can pull the growth of the country.

28:02 So your share price has had a bit of a tough time.

28:04 Yes, I think it's down 13% since November.

28:06 It's down significantly from when you IPO.

28:09 Are you? What's the underlying reason that I'm

28:11 sure you're disappointed of that? Absolutely.

28:14 But we know what we have in front of us. So, I mean, we are not exploiting the

28:22 increasing spread that the traditional banks are enjoying.

28:26 We always to remunerated our deposits. We want to keep doing it because it's

28:31 safer from a bonus point of view. So we are not those one of those one of

28:36 those banks that are really getting profits from just from a from if

28:41 not from yields. At the same time, our exit from the NPL

28:45 direct investment will help and at the same time,

28:50 our results, their continuous growth will show the market that that we are

28:55 worth much more than we are presently on down.

28:59 Mr. Rose, Are you telling me that as a

29:00 challenger bank you also have to be more generous with your depositors and the

29:04 traditional banks? Yes, not generous.

29:07 I mean, it's really a matter of always keeping a balance between the duration

29:13 of the liabilities and the duration of the assets.

29:16 I mean, I believe in that. I mean, certainly you'll give up some

29:20 profit margin, but your risk profile is much stronger and your long term

29:25 perspective is stronger. So that's our choice.

29:29 And that 100 million worth of profit and 7 billion worth of volumes is the

29:34 evidence that it's reasonably good strategy.

29:38 Would you take it back private? That's a question you shouldn't ask to a

29:43 listed company. No, not nothing on the table yet.

29:48 But in any case, I wouldn't answer to that question.

29:51 What's what's your biggest concern over the next 12 months?

29:54 I mean, we talked about the possible mistake from from interest rates and

29:58 from central banks. Geopolitics are extremely difficult

30:02 actually, to navigate. Probably price.

30:05 That's your main worry. That's the main word.

30:07 I mean, we are having at least two main war risk very close to us.

30:15 That's the main thing. I would avoid a recession because if you

30:20 add to this and geopolitical uncertainty, also more social malaise.

30:26 With so many elections coming out and we so many populist using these

30:33 uncertainties to trigger fears in the people, that might become the major

30:40 risk. Do you feel like Europe as a bloc is is

30:43 a bit weak because you don't have. AS Yeah, we certainly feel a lack of

30:47 leadership. Europe is one of the global powers, but

30:53 China is to be more United States are doing more.

30:56 India is coming up. The Middle East is creating a sort of

31:01 new poll of power and Europe is not expressing.

31:05 At what we could do because we have to be aware of our social and economic

31:11 model that is safer and probably more reliable than others.

31:15 We are big. I mean, we are still one of the very big

31:19 markets. We are not using our strength and we are

31:23 not investing on the future. That's why federal investments.

31:27 So money that we raised together in this legalistic way and the investments we do

31:33 together to foster innovation are in the common infrastructure has to become the

31:40 priority. Mr.

31:41 Pastor, as always, thank you so much. Thank you for dropping by.

31:43 Our London studio that was corralled by Sarah Liberty's chief executive.

31:48 And we're also getting some UK PMI readings.

31:50 Of course, it's 930, so we always have a bit of UK data manufacturing PMI coming

31:55 in at 47.5, pretty much in line with estimates actually a touch above.

31:59 It's the 19th consecutive month of contraction for the highest reading

32:02 since last April. So there you go.

32:05 You can see Sterling one 2627. Coming up, the French construction

32:09 materials company SAINT-GOBAIN results topped estimates as it agrees a takeover

32:14 deal with the Australian rival CSR. We'll be speaking exclusively to Sun

32:18 Global's chief executive, Ben Roberson. He's coming up next.

32:22 And this is Bloomberg.

32:38 Now, shares in Singapore have been slumping this morning, giving up earlier

32:41 gains after the French construction materials company reported earnings now

32:44 earlier this week. Sancho also struck a $3 billion deal to

32:49 take over Australian rival CSR. I'm pleased to be joined by the chief

32:52 executive of Saint-gobain. He is.

32:55 Mr. Buzz, thank you so much for joining us.

32:57 There's a lot going on certainly in your space and in your industry.

33:01 The construction and renovations market for new homes and office buildings have

33:06 been plunging after a pretty incredible couple of years.

33:09 So what does this mean for a single brand going forward?

33:13 We have delivered a very strong set of results for 2023.

33:18 Record operating margin, record cashflow.

33:21 It means that the transformation of SANGOMAR has delivered great results.

33:26 The Bulls are the initial targets and we have also given Western guidance for

33:31 2024 that despite certain difficult markets going forward, notably in

33:36 Europe, we are keen to deliver the fourth straight year of double digit

33:40 margin. So I'm very confident about the

33:42 prospects of Sangomar going forward and very happy that we will welcome soon.

33:49 And colleagues, it is a fantastic acquisition in the fast growing

33:53 Australian market. But Mr.

33:56 President, is there something that that analysts aren't quite understanding?

33:59 I know that share prices fluctuate, but at the moment your share price is down

34:04 four and a half percent. Were they expecting more?

34:07 I think they don't realize all the support and the confidence we have on

34:12 the margin. We adjusted a bit on the expectations

34:15 for slight negative organic growth that may have been for some of them.

34:19 The slight difference versus the consensus on slightly, we guide for low

34:26 single digit volume down and a slight negative price for technical

34:30 mathematical effect. This is the stronger read that we had in

34:33 2023. And I think the magnitude of also the

34:37 trade on price cost with energy raw materials coming down may have been a

34:42 bit underestimated this morning. So it's the first time that we guided

34:47 the beginning of the year for double digit margin.

34:50 So that shows the confidence that we have on the transformation of Sangomar

34:54 and all the structural benefits. So again, I think it will take a bit of

34:59 time for everyone to realise that. But the first time we got on the double

35:02 digits and it would be the fourth straight year of strong performance of

35:07 Sangomar. So I'm very confident that any weakness

35:10 is actually a strong point for some shareholders to run.

35:16 You're very good, Mr. Reza.

35:17 So can you give us a sense of, you know, these worry about construction and

35:20 renovation markets, the fact that in many countries in Europe, they're taking

35:25 a plunge? What does this mean for a single bank

35:26 going forward? You know, we are all driven by

35:30 renovation. It's 60% of all sales in Europe.

35:34 The new construction in Europe is only 12% of our total sales.

35:37 And that's the area where we were negative last year and will be negative

35:42 in 24. But quarter by quarter.

35:45 Country by country reaching the trough. So that's the good news.

35:48 We have reached a trough. For instance, if I take Poland, Eastern

35:51 Europe last year, where we are up in volumes.

35:55 So that's the new beat in Europe, which is the only area are saying goodbye,

35:59 will see negative volumes in 2024. In the rest of the world, North America,

36:04 Asia, emerging markets, we expect growth and that's positive.

36:08 And now after the huge transformation of sangoma that we have done over the

36:12 years, we have to third to third of our profit coming from North America, Asia,

36:17 emerging markets. So maybe there is a bit of disconnect

36:19 between the top line where we are still a bit more driven by Western Europe, but

36:23 the profit where we are to sell, driven by North America, Asia, emerging

36:29 markets. And that has been the success of Sangoma

36:31 and will remain so going forward. And I know you've also been reshaping,

36:36 of course, on Global's portfolio. You've exit, for example, distribution

36:39 of your construction products. Do you still want to supply glass to the

36:44 automotive industry? How will you continue reshaping your

36:47 portfolio and maybe exit some of the markets?

36:51 We are all driven by value creation and, you know, the return on capital employed

36:55 at renewable 15% consistently in the last few years.

36:58 Total shareholder return has been above 25% per year in the last four years.

37:03 So it's all about value creation and therefore continue to make some

37:07 tradeoffs on our payment deal with some exit of businesses which are far from

37:12 our strategy or soften our financial implications and then integrate, well,

37:18 some nice acquisitions. The recent ones in the US on

37:21 Construction Chemical have created value in year to one year ahead of plan.

37:25 So I think also sunk by, as shown in the last five years, a very strong high

37:30 level reputation and how we acquire and integrate fantastic businesses.

37:35 So it's all about value creation and just continue to reshape the portfolio.

37:40 We are committed to that within and out. Along with this, we love value creation

37:45 for all shareholders, good integration of acquisitions, Australians to get

37:49 confident about what it will bring to think about.

37:51 We have more IDs in North America, we have more ideas in construction,

37:55 chemical and yes, we will also continue to divest some businesses.

38:00 So when you say more ideas that you'd be looking to buy companies, I know CSR is

38:04 a big acquisition, so that will probably take time to pull it completely through.

38:08 But is there anything in emerging markets or elsewhere that you'd be

38:12 looking to buy? It's, of course, small size, but we did

38:15 some in Malaysia last year, in Egypt, in Mexico, in Brazil, in India.

38:20 We entered into insulation in India where we have a very strong position on

38:25 glass and plasterboard. So, yeah, there are many ideas around

38:27 the world on emerging markets and also in North America.

38:31 You know, we doubled our size in Canada in the last two years and we still have

38:34 a grow in North America. So we have to very clear and we have

38:39 been very consistent on our strategic goals.

38:42 One is geographic development, North America, Asia, emerging markets, and

38:47 second is construction chemicals. We will continue to push for that.

38:52 We add, for instance, 11 acquisitions in concentrate chemical last year and the

38:57 integration of Kaiser GCP is ahead of plan.

39:00 We improved the combined margin of more than 400 basis points.

39:04 That's a huge achievement. Yeah, we had more than 5% organic growth

39:08 on those businesses, so a lot of good positive prospects for Saint-gobain

39:11 going forward. Mr.

39:14 President, thank you so much for joining us.

39:15 I was the chief executive of Psagot. But now coming up, the world looks on as

39:20 China's NPC meeting begins. We preview the many challenges faced by

39:24 the leaders gathering in Beijing. Our chief minister Asia correspondent

39:27 explains next. And this is Bloomberg.

39:46 The conversations that matter, the insights you need.

39:48 This is a pulse. And I'm Francine Lacqua here in London.

39:51 Now, the so called the two sessions, the National People's Congress and the

39:54 Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference begin on Monday.

39:57 Our chief North Asia correspondent Andy Stephen Engle looks at the many

40:01 challenges faced by leaders gathering in Beijing.

40:06 The National People's Congress or NPC, is China's annual session of Parliament,

40:11 convened usually every spring in the Great Hall of the People next to

40:15 Tiananmen Square in central Beijing. Essentially, the NPC sets the political

40:20 agenda for the year ahead when the nearly 3000 delegates from around the

40:24 country get their marching orders on day one in the form of a lengthy work report

40:29 from Premier Li Qiang. While regarded as the highest organ of

40:33 state power, the NPC nevertheless operates under the direction of the

40:37 Communist Party of China. The NPC by design legislates and

40:42 executes the directives of the party. The roughly two week affair is

40:48 colloquially known as Liang Hui meaning the two sessions as the NPC is preceded

40:54 by a gathering of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, or

40:59 CPPCC, an advisory body supposedly representing views from the broader

41:04 society and business community. Even though party membership is not

41:08 required to be in the CPPCC, it is nevertheless directly supervised by the

41:15 Communist Party. Well, that was Bloomberg's chief North

41:20 Asia correspondent, Stephen Angle. Now, a couple of things we need to keep

41:23 an eye on, of course. Dow soaring premarket after it reported

41:26 bumper sales and profit driven by the eye known for its PC business.

41:31 Dell has attracted attention for its high powered servers needed to run AI

41:36 systems. You can see Dell pre-market gaining some

41:39 21%. This could also give a boost to some of

41:43 their competitors in the same space. Also, New York Community Bancorp has

41:48 plunged premarket. That's after the bank said it had

41:51 discovered material weaknesses and how it tracks loan risks.

41:55 It also wrote down the value of companies it acquired years ago and

41:59 replaced its leadership to grapple with the turmoil.

42:02 You can see at New York Community Bancorp down some 28.6%.

42:08 Now, of course, the story today is European stocks in general rising over

42:14 some of the relief after we got, of course, the US inflation figure now

42:19 moves in. Global equity markets yesterday were

42:21 positive because we had the Fed's preferred inflation measures and that

42:27 was on personal consumption expenditure. This is the data that we know the Fed

42:31 looks at. It rose in January at the fastest pace

42:34 in nearly a year, but it did match economists forecasts.

42:38 At the same time, some of the sentiment was surge, I guess, by jobless claims

42:42 data that indicated the labor market softening a touch.

42:45 A reminder also the other piece of news is that the S&P governor will be

42:50 stepping down in the second half of the year and we'll be speaking to him a

42:53 little bit later on that conversation with Thomas Jourdan this afternoon.
