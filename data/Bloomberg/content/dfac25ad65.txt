The video was truly shocking: a gang of masked gunmen assaulting the set of a news broadcast in mid-show, taking staff hostage and pointing their long barrels at reporters begging for their lives.



The viral images unleashed a cascade of social media commentary about the worrying state of affairs in Ecuador, a country that not long ago was among the safest in Latin America but is now a combat zone, with narco gangs disputing the stateâ€™s authority after years of institutional deterioration.

As exceptional and terrifying as this episode might seem, it speaks to a reality that has been entrenching itself around the region, without any control or solution in sight. More than 400 massacres were registered in Mexico in 2023; this year opened with a deadly episode in which narco groups allegedly used drones in an attack against locals. Even in Argentina, a relatively safe country, the new governor of Santa Fe province sent his family away after receiving death threats from criminal groups that operate in Rosario, a key corridor for drug trafficking to Europe.
