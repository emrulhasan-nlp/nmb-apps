UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said world leaders should hold back from regulating artificial intelligence before they’ve fully understood the rapidly developing technology, even as he outlined a host of risks it poses.

In a speech on Thursday outlining the threats posed by AI, Sunak said that if developers get the technology “wrong,” it could enable terrorists to “spread fear and destruction,” make it easier to build chemical and biological weapons, facilitate cyber-attacks, fraud and child sexual abuse, and even pose a risk to humanity itself. Nevertheless, he urged restraint when it comes to governing the technology’s development.
