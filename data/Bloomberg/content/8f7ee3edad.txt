The world’s per capita gross domestic product rose 185% between 1950 and 2000 — more since then. US agricultural output, which soared in the 1800s, rose again nearly fivefold in the ensuing century.

Despite the increase in global tensions, military expenditures are far lower than in the past — 2.2% of global GDP against 6.4% in 1961.
