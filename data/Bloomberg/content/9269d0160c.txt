Walt Disney Co.’s lawsuit against Ron DeSantis was reassigned to the Donald Trump -appointed judge who previously upheld the law that sparked the feud between the entertainment company and the conservative Florida governor.

The case was transferred to US District Judge Allen Winsor on Thursday, after US District Judge Mark Walker recused himself due to a relative’s ownership of Disney stock. Walker, a Barack Obama appointee, had ruled against DeSantis several times in culture-war cases.
