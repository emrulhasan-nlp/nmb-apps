Crime has surged to the forefront of Brazilians’ minds in recent months, supplanting economic issues as their top concern and sparking consternation inside President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva ’s administration over how to respond.

Roughly 60% of Brazilians now rank crime as the biggest issue facing the country, according to a March survey released by AtlasIntel, four times the share that said it was the economy. The worries have helped drive overall approval of the leftist Lula — whose winning 2022 campaign focused largely on rebuilding the economy and combating poverty in the wake of the pandemic — to the lowest levels of his term.
