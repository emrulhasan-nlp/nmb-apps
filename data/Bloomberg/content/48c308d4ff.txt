00:17 This is Bloomberg Daybreak, Middle East Africa.

00:20 Our top stories this morning. Super Tuesday sees Biden and Trump win

00:23 big and the most important round of primary contests.

00:26 But Vermont is cold for Nikki Haley. We'll bring you all the latest as the

00:30 results come in. Stocks in Hong Kong rebound as markets

00:35 look ahead to testimony from Fed Chair Jay Powell.

00:38 Bitcoin gives investors vertigo, hitting an all time high before plunging nearly

00:42 $10,000 in just a few hours. Plus, China's bullish growth target

00:48 leaves investors looking for more details.

00:51 Top officials from the central bank and the securities regulator are set to hold

00:54 a briefing later today. It's just gone 8 a.m.

00:58 across the Emirates. I'm Vonnie Quinn in Dubai.

01:00 Welcome to DAYBREAK, Middle East and Africa.

01:02 Let's see how we're shaping up for the Wednesday session.

01:04 This is markets trying to digest Super Tuesday results and, of course, the tech

01:09 meltdown that we saw yesterday, which had the Nasdaq 100 down 1.8% on the

01:12 session and the S&P 500 down 1%. Looks like we might be trying to reverse

01:17 things, at least in the very, very early going here with futures higher for the

01:20 S&P and the NASDAQ. We'll also be looking very much ahead to

01:24 Jay Powell's testimony today and tomorrow.

01:26 The ten year yield at four 1486. That's down 15 basis points in just a

01:31 week. Will it continue to urge patience?

01:33 We shall see. Brent crude at 1816, it is higher by

01:36 $0.12, but there is a little weightiness.

01:38 The AP said that stockpiles were pretty high.

01:41 Let's take a look at this chart, though, because it is really a fascinating one.

01:45 It turns out in the end, Bitcoin and gold hit their all time highs on the

01:49 same day. That day happened to be yesterday.

01:51 As you can see, gold stuck around. Bitcoin didn't.

01:54 It was down to 50,000, 59,000 and change at one point back up in the 60 to 63000

02:00 region now. An interesting start.

02:03 ETF flows are showing outflows from gold ETFs by about $4.6 billion.

02:10 Inflows into Bitcoin ETFs to the tune of about $8 billion.

02:14 Read from that what you will. Well, let's get more on that tech

02:17 meltdown now and how Asia is digesting all the news out of the NPC.

02:21 We'll get across to April Hong in our Singapore studio.

02:24 April 2nd. Yeah.

02:27 Vonnie digesting the NPC, but also looking to Powell's testimony and the

02:33 Super Tuesday results. So as you can imagine, there's not a

02:36 whole lot of appetite for risk in the region, particularly for tech.

02:40 Those are the shares that are coming under pressure, especially the Apple

02:44 suppliers. After counterpoint research that showed

02:47 that slump in iPhone sales in China, those China worries are not in

02:51 themselves new, but perhaps reinforcing the worries for a major market for

02:57 Apple. So the likes of LG infotech among the

03:00 big losers on the costs fee renesas among the big losers on the Nikkei.

03:03 So the board let's take a look at what we're seeing in China where it is almost

03:07 a reversal from yesterday's performance where Chinese tech stocks dragged the

03:12 Hang Seng today. It is doing the opposite.

03:15 And JD.com e-commerce giant leading the charge ahead of its earnings.

03:19 There is some optimism that it can beat the competition, but overall, Chinese

03:24 consumer names are doing well today, perhaps in anticipation of what we're

03:28 going to see from the press briefing from the senior Chinese officials later

03:33 today buddy. Exactly.

03:37 April, thank you. We'll be back with you to check on

03:39 market movements as April Hong in Singapore.

03:42 Former President Donald Trump sweeping Republican primaries, for the most part,

03:46 moving closer to clinching the party's nomination.

03:49 Meanwhile, President Biden has so far won all Democratic contests.

03:53 Both are gearing up for a likely rematch in the race to the White House in

03:57 November. Let's get the latest from Bloomberg's

03:59 Washington senior editor, Wendy Benjamin.

04:01 And so, Wendy, Nikki Haley didn't have a watch party, so we don't know her

04:05 reaction, but we have to wonder what will happen to those Haley supporters

04:09 now that Trump has basically made an almost clean sweep in Super Tuesday with

04:12 the exception of Vermont. Right.

04:16 Exactly. So she did win that one state tonight.

04:18 She won the District of Columbia primary, and that gives her a couple of

04:22 delegates to the nominating convention in July, but not enough to clinch the

04:27 nomination. And so Haley supporters now have a real

04:31 decision to make in the general election.

04:33 They have till November to decide, but they will decide whether to vote for

04:38 Donald Trump, who would clearly be their second choice if they voted for Haley in

04:42 the first place. Switch over to the Democratic ballot and

04:45 vote for Joe Biden if they really, really don't like Donald Trump or stay

04:49 home. So, you know, we just don't know yet how

04:52 that's going. But there is a real sense, while it's an

04:56 almost certainty that Donald Trump will be the Republican nominee for president

04:59 in 24. And just in the last few moments, Wendy,

05:05 as I'm sure you've seen, we're getting notification that Trump has won the

05:08 California GOP presidential primary. That's according to CNN and also to NBC.

05:15 So can we draw any other conclusions about the state of the race at this

05:18 point, other than the fact that it's going to be most likely a Biden Trump

05:22 rematch? Well, no, I mean, not from the results

05:27 tonight, really, except that we do know that the polling is showing that in

05:33 critical swing states. This is what our Bloomberg News Morning

05:36 Council poll shows Trump is leading in all of the states that will be decisive

05:40 in the election. The states that Biden is winning in are

05:43 the truly Democratic states California, you know, Vermont, Massachusetts, places

05:48 like that. But in the in the states where this

05:51 election is truly decided right now, Trump is polling ahead.

05:55 That could mean nothing in November. It could be that once people really

05:59 focus on the election, I mean, right now the election isn't till November.

06:04 Most people are sort of, you know, going about their lives, but at some point

06:08 they will turn their focus to the election and then really consider, you

06:13 know, whether they want another four years of Donald Trump or another four

06:16 years of Joe Biden. And that's what we'll all be seeing.

06:22 So in terms of what's next, Wendy, what happens now?

06:26 Campaign wise, we obviously know that Donald Trump still has legal issues to

06:30 contend with, although we did get one big decision this week.

06:33 But more will be coming down the pike. What's next for him and what's next for

06:36 Joe Biden, who's embroiled in this war? Two wars, basically.

06:41 Right. Well, he is.

06:42 But his hit, Biden's big moment comes later this week in Thursday night.

06:48 He will give his State of the Union address, which is an annual address to

06:51 Congress. It's always televised.

06:53 It's a big primetime event. But in this case, in an election year,

06:57 the incumbent president, if he or she is running again, will be laying out their

07:02 vision for not only the rest of this year, but in Biden's case, this year, a

07:07 second term. So that speech will really be seen and

07:11 is being seen by the White House as the kickoff to the general election campaign

07:15 against Donald Trump. So we'll hear what policy aims Biden has

07:21 for 2024 and maybe even his second term. And for Donald Trump, it's, you know, a

07:27 lot of the criminal trials he faces for criminal trials, some of them are being

07:31 delayed. There is one that will start later in

07:33 March. But he really doesn't have to do a lot

07:37 of campaigning. Retail politics, we call it where he

07:40 goes to, you know, fairs and things like that and talks to people.

07:43 He doesn't really have to do that. The next huge events besides a possible

07:47 conviction for Donald Trump would be the conventions that later this summer where

07:52 they will be formally nominated. Wendy, thank you so much for all your

07:57 context in the last few hours. That's Bloomberg's Washington senior

08:00 editor, Wendy Benjamin. Now to China and day two of the key

08:05 National People's Congress in Beijing. Markets are digesting the latest

08:09 comments from President Xi Jinping, calling for local governments to develop

08:12 new productive forces as China works to meet a round 5% growth target.

08:19 For more, let's bring in China economy editor Jill Jesus in Hong Kong.

08:22 So this new phrase, these more productive targets, what does it mean?

08:26 What is this new phrase supposed to symbolize?

08:29 Jill. Sure, Vonnie.

08:31 So, look, China loves its slogans. We hear them all the time.

08:34 They always have something to do with some strategy or economic development or

08:38 something like that. I think this one is pretty important.

08:42 One, it's Xi Jinping saying it. There's literally little else that's

08:46 ever more important than something that's coming directly from the mouth of

08:50 the most powerful man in China. And two, I think that in talking about

08:54 these new productive forces, focusing on, you know, where the targeted

08:58 industries, where that can be achieved is really important for the overall

09:02 growth trajectory of China in the next decade.

09:04 So, look, we know that China's property sector once contributed to something

09:09 like 25% of GDP is in crisis. And no matter what happens with the

09:13 resolution of the property turmoil, it's never going to get back to contributing

09:19 that much to overall economic growth. That means China has to focus on driving

09:23 up investments and activity in really, really targeted sectors where it sees a

09:28 lot more room for growth. So that's advanced AI.

09:30 You're looking at new energy vehicles, renewables, that kind of stuff.

09:34 Xi Jinping telling local economies to really sort of put this focus on, you

09:39 know, mobilizing these productive forces to, you know, make gains in those types

09:43 of industries indicates where the government really sees a lot of that

09:46 long term growth trajectory actually coming from now, how soon they can

09:50 actually achieve that and sort of mobilize the transformation of the

09:53 economy is another factor altogether. Well, certainly we're seeing a reversal

09:59 of some of the kinds, at least in Hong Kong today.

10:01 And we'll see if that continues throughout the day.

10:03 But there is still growing concern over whether China can actually achieve this

10:07 growth target of. Yeah.

10:11 So, Vonnie, we just talked a bit about more of those longer term trajectories

10:14 for the Chinese economy. I think when you're talking about the

10:17 growth target, you're really looking at shorter term what's happening in 2024.

10:21 China has set a goal for itself of around 5% growth in 2024.

10:26 That's same as last year's target, but it's up against a much less favorable

10:30 base of comparison. So that means that China's going to have

10:32 to do more to actually achieve that growth target.

10:36 Now, so far, what we've heard at the National People's Congress doesn't

10:40 really give analysts a whole lot of hope that we're going to see any kind of big

10:44 stimulus to actually make that target happen.

10:47 A lot of things that we've seen so far, the deficit ratio, that kind of stuff

10:51 seems pretty conservative as China is obviously incredibly focused on risks

10:56 from amassing too much extra debt or something like that.

10:58 But I think what economists are really hoping for, what investors are really

11:01 hoping for, is more that actually shows, you know, something in the way of

11:05 concrete policy action. How are we going to restore consumption

11:08 confidence, that kind of stuff. So what are we watching out for next

11:14 from the NPC jail? So the big thing is next up is going to

11:20 be this press conference later this afternoon, Beijing time.

11:24 So it's round, you know, two, 3:00 in the afternoon.

11:27 We're going to have a press conference with a bunch of major ministers.

11:31 So the head of the People's Bank of China, you're looking at the finance

11:34 minister, you're looking at the new securities regulator who has just put in

11:37 place a few weeks ago after this massive multitrillion dollar stock market rout.

11:42 And this is an opportunity for us to get more details on what exactly economic

11:46 growth is going to look like over the next year.

11:49 I think that's going to be a really fascinating press conference that we're

11:51 playing incredibly close attention to, just to see whether those ministers can

11:56 provide us with more detail on what exactly we're expecting out of the

11:59 world's second largest economy. Well, certainly the Hang Seng is

12:04 rallying hard today, up 2.3%. Not so much, though, for the CSI 300, up

12:09 just a fraction of 1%. Bloomberg's China economy editor Jill

12:12 Disease in Hong Kong. Thank you.

12:15 And still ahead, we'll talk global market strategy with Bank of Singapore's

12:18 chief economist. With the Fed's rate path and China

12:21 Growth Plans in Focus. Massimo, you will join us.

12:24 This is Bloomberg.

12:52 Investors are awaiting a key news conference at China's policy meeting.

12:56 They're standing by as well for Fed Chair Jay Powell's congressional

13:00 testimony. Stocks in Asia are trading fairly flat

13:03 while the tech sector is underperforming to a certain extent.

13:06 Let's bring in Mansoor Moli, Uddin, chief economist at the Bank of

13:09 Singapore. Very happy to have you this morning.

13:12 Mansoor. Thanks for joining us.

13:14 Let's look ahead to Jay Powell testimony.

13:16 Will we hear any messages from Powell beyond the fact that investors need to

13:20 be patient? Ivone And I think power's going to play

13:26 it safe today. I do think that he will indicate the Fed

13:30 still want to cut interest rates, but they're waiting for more evidence that

13:33 the economy is slowing down, labour market is easing and inflationary

13:37 pressures are coming down before the Fed will be willing to lower interest rates.

13:41 So I don't think we'll get any real surprises at today's testimony from

13:44 Powell. He definitely won't want to surprise the

13:49 market. It has happened in the past, though the

13:51 market has been surprised. We have seen a 15 basis point drop in

13:54 safe the ten year yield. Is that signaling anything, signaling

13:59 anything? I think ten year yields are moving

14:03 partly because of developments we saw overnight in Europe.

14:07 I don't think they're really moving yet on what Powell will say.

14:11 I'd say that he has surprise in the past.

14:13 So if there's anything that can move the markets, it would be, I suspect, Powell

14:18 reiterating confidence. The Fed do feel that they can cut

14:22 interest rates, say, from Q2. If he gives a clearer signal, then yes,

14:26 you'd see more moves lower in ten year yields and bond yields across the board.

14:32 So once we're we obviously get another payrolls report Friday, which will be

14:36 crucial, as is every data point these days.

14:39 But at last, look, the services still we're experiencing extremely high

14:45 inflation core services in particular, and that's not coming down.

14:48 Do we need to see that coming down before the Fed will cost

14:52 more than that? Yeah, I'd say right.

14:54 We did see core services coming down not just in the US, but in Europe as well

14:59 before central banks that can come. Then you say the payrolls number this

15:03 week is going to be really important. January's was a real surprise.

15:07 The payrolls numbers increased by over 350,000 jobs.

15:10 Now that's partly due to seasonals, but it still shows the strength of the US

15:14 labor market. So Powell and the rest of the FOMC will

15:18 want to see the payroll numbers slow down.

15:20 They'll want to see the core services numbers slow down as well.

15:25 And that's why I think today he'll just be very patient.

15:27 Play a safe game and suggest, look, the risks are that they will get that

15:31 slowdown that will cut rates, but not just yet.

15:34 So no signal yet for March or for May, more likely still June for the first

15:39 rate cuts. Let's move to China because we're

15:44 getting a growth target now 5%. Is that over optimistic months or.

15:50 You know what I think is I think what

15:53 they've done by setting the growth target the same as last year is to show

15:57 some ambition, but also to signal that the authorities will undertake further

16:01 easing. You remember last year growth target, 5%

16:04 was easier to achieve because the pace in 2022 was so low this year, trying to

16:10 get 5% growth means you do have to have stronger activity across the board.

16:15 So I think it signals we will get further fiscal and monetary easing this

16:19 year, Plus more measures on the property markets is really central for China's

16:23 recovery. Moving just a little bit further.

16:29 Japan, we had been anticipating that we'd see a move in April, but just in

16:33 recent days and weeks, investors seem to be pushing that out even more.

16:37 Is it possible now with the Fed sort of not looking likely to move until maybe

16:42 June, even at this point, that also Tokyo has to delay its interest rate,

16:47 move interest rates? I think what will happen in Tokyo is

16:53 that the Bank of Japan will really wait for the Asian to spring wage round

16:57 numbers. They'll come out this month.

17:00 I think this month's BOJ meeting is too early still for the central bank to

17:04 raise interest rates. But April really seems the right time to

17:07 go ahead. If the spring wage round shows salary

17:09 increases again for the second year in a row, then policymakers will feel

17:14 confident that inflation will settle around their 2% target.

17:18 If they don't move in April, then the risks are they can keep on getting

17:20 delayed further and further if they say any external shocks or external adverse

17:25 development. So I think April really means of time

17:28 for the bridge to move. And if they go ahead, then the market is

17:33 obviously looking to see whether they'll have a series of rate hikes or whether

17:37 they'll just do one and done. And we're in the latter camp.

17:39 We think it'll just be one BGA rate hike this year.

17:44 One and done. Well, right now we have the end trading

17:46 below 150 again. One 4995.

17:49 I just want to ask you if there's any little pockets of currency movement out

17:53 there that concern you because, you know, dollar or yen or even the yuan?

18:00 Yeah, it's very interesting. At the moment.

18:02 The markets have been pretty rangebound over the last few weeks.

18:05 They're looking for a catalyst to break out again.

18:07 There could be many changes by the Fed or other central banks, could be what's

18:12 going on the Middle East. Clearly, I do think probably it could be

18:15 the data itself. The US data in particular does finally

18:18 slow down. Then we like to see the dollar begin to

18:21 moderate. And that's why the payrolls number again

18:23 on Friday is going to be really the key focus this week.

18:29 We will be looking forward to that d x y right now at 103 81, Mansur Mo, chief

18:34 economist at the Bank of Singapore, thank you so much for joining us this

18:37 morning. Plenty more is still ahead right here on

18:40 DAYBREAK, Middle East and Africa. This is Bloomberg.

19:02 US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has urged Hamas leaders to agree to a cease

19:06 fire deal that would free some hostages in Gaza.

19:09 He's also calling on Israel to let in more humanitarian aid for increasingly

19:13 desperate Palestinians. Blinken was speaking after a meeting

19:17 with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed al-Thani in Washington.

19:20 Let's get more now from Bloomberg's owner.

19:22 And these aren't the official negotiations on war, but it's quite

19:26 clear that there's more pressure coming from Washington these days.

19:29 It wasn't just al-Thani. Other people were in the region as well.

19:33 I'm thinking about Benny Gantz. Does this add to the negotiation sort of

19:38 material? I think so.

19:41 I think the pressure by the U.S. is sort of an attempt to mitigate the

19:46 fallout from last week's incident near an aid convoy in Gaza where dozens of

19:52 people were killed. Joe Biden himself said that that

19:55 incident, the violence could set back the cease fire talks.

19:59 So what we're seeing today now in Washington is that Blinken is, on the

20:04 one hand putting the saying that the ball is in Hamas support to release the

20:09 hostages, increases the release of hostages to get the ceasefire talks

20:14 revived again. And on the other hand, he also used the

20:17 opportunity to press on with the prime minister in D.C.

20:20 to also say that more aid must come into Gaza as part of the as part of the part

20:27 of the deal that was for a deal. So I think the overall Blinken's message

20:30 has been to both sides that there should be more to breathe new life into a cease

20:35 fire which appears to have suffered from the violence needed from life in Gaza

20:40 that left dozens of people dead last week.

20:45 And not only there, but there's also trouble continually in the Red Sea.

20:50 The US has shot down a hoodie anti-ship ballistic missile and also three one way

20:55 drone attacks. It's the latest and it's ongoing.

20:58 Do we expect more or. Yeah, the drone and missile attacks have

21:03 been going on for months, as you know. I think the the peak in a way in these

21:09 attacks was the fact that the ruby mark, a vessel loaded with fertilizer and fuel

21:14 oil that had been hit by the missiles in February and go wild for this ship that

21:21 all instinct but it finally did a few days ago.

21:24 And now the authorities are warning that this is the first time that the attacks

21:29 on a ship resulting in this ship sinking is making clear to everyone that there

21:34 is also a great environmental risk in the Red Sea, not only a risk to

21:38 commercial shipping because the area is known for

21:43 is is basically very vulnerable to to to crude oil or or other forms of chemicals

21:52 released from ships that can sink just like the Ruby Mart did.

21:56 And the latest attacks after the latest incident was the fact that the two ships

22:01 to hit merchant ships were targeted in response to which the U.S.

22:04 Navy shot down an anti-ship ballistic missile by the Philippines yesterday.

22:10 Yeah. Owner is.

22:11 Thank you so much for all the context. We really appreciate it.

22:14 That's Bloomberg's owner. And just want to make a couple of

22:17 headlines out of Hong Kong. Hong Kong now saying that Telegram and

22:21 signal should both be prohibited in an Article 23 proposal.

22:25 Once again, Hong Kong, including Telegram and Signal bands and the

22:30 Article 23 Views Summary. Now, these are views submitted by the

22:34 public on Article 23 consultation. And again, they're saying the Telegram

22:38 and Signal, which are of course apps that users can use to stay anonymous

22:41 while communicating with each other. They're not quite as open as regular

22:45 email or texting. Signal and telegram should be prohibited

22:49 in an Article 23 proposal. Do stay tuned.

22:53 Plenty more ahead. This is Bloomberg Daybreak Middle East

22:56 and Africa.

23:20 This is Bloomberg Daybreak, Middle East and Africa.

23:22 Our top stories this morning. Super Tuesday sees Biden and Trump win

23:26 big in the most important round of primary contests.

23:29 But to our moms is called for Nikki Haley.

23:31 We'll bring you all the latest as the results come in.

23:35 Stocks in Hong Kong rebound as markets look ahead to testimony from Fed Chair

23:38 Jay Powell. Bitcoin gives investors vertigo.

23:42 It hit an all time high before plunging nearly $10,000 in just a few hours.

23:48 Does China's bullish growth target leaves investors looking for more

23:51 details? Top officials from the central bank and

23:53 the securities regulator are set to hold a briefing later today.

23:57 830 across the Emirates Flight Vonnie Quinn in Dubai.

24:00 And let's take a look at how we are shaping up for the Wednesday trading

24:02 session. This after a down day for the S&P 500

24:05 yesterday, down by 1%. The NASDAQ 100 was down by 1.8%.

24:10 A real meltdown in tech that we haven't seen for some time.

24:13 Following the China news, lacking in detail, perhaps, but we are seeing a

24:17 rebound today. So not long lived.

24:19 Futures definitely pointed higher for the US.

24:21 Session markets will be trying to digest the Super Tuesday results, too, with

24:25 Donald Trump having a near sweep. On the Republican side, we're down 15

24:29 basis points in a week on the ten year yield.

24:30 We'll see if that changes after Fed Chair Jay Powell's first day of

24:33 testimony later. Brent crude, even though we are awash in

24:36 supply, according to the API 8218 and WTI also is still above $78 a barrel.

24:44 Take a look at this chart neatly summarizes what's been happening with

24:47 gold and bitcoin. You wouldn't have thought they'd hit an

24:50 all time high on the same day, but they both did.

24:52 As you can see, Bitcoin retreated. Gold didn't.

24:56 In the ETF world, we are seeing outflows from gold ETFs to the tune of about $4.6

25:01 billion. While we're seeing major inflows into

25:04 Bitcoin ETF there, it's to the tune of about $8 billion.

25:08 So the dynamics are really interesting. But let's check in on how markets in

25:12 Asia are faring. One day after we began to get a trickle

25:15 of news out of the NPC. April Hong is in our Singapore studio.

25:18 April. Yeah.

25:22 Funny. I showed you earlier how Hang Seng Tech

25:25 is recovering from yesterday. And key among those moves is what we're

25:29 seeing in JD.com, the e-commerce giant surging by the most since December 2022

25:34 ahead of its earnings. Some of this might be short covering,

25:38 but there also seems to be optimism that it can beat the competition because of

25:41 its focus on value for money products. And if you take a look at what it's done

25:46 in the past couple of quarters is actually here in yellow, its revenue

25:50 growth has been trailing the competition.

25:52 Why it is Alibaba and we have VIP shop in Orange.

25:56 So that's something to keep in mind ahead of its earnings release.

25:58 Let's look at the board. We also want to take a look at some of

26:00 the other movers in the Asia-Pacific. We're zeroing in on two of the shadow

26:06 lenders in India, GM Financial i f l finance after India's regulator more or

26:12 less tightened scrutiny on financial risk.

26:15 And now they're saying these financial lenders, shadow banks, they cannot lend

26:20 via shares or bonds. So there's an extension of the declines

26:25 from yesterday. This stock already tanked 20% yesterday,

26:29 piling on those losses today. GM Financial also in focus.

26:32 This is a systemically important shadow bank that we've been watching as well.

26:36 Money. Yeah.

26:39 What are we seeing in central bank expectations in the API region?

26:43 April. Yeah, I think the G tens are in focus

26:49 and as we have swaps market is pricing in that April lift off of the BOJ.

26:54 We have the biggest Japanese lender saying that it is positioning for a

26:59 march move from the central bank. Meantime, we had the chief economist of

27:04 the RBNZ saying that if the Fed cut the RBNZ, it could ease sooner because that

27:10 would lift the Kiwi, that would help inflation.

27:13 That is helping the Kiwi bonds and the ones in Australia.

27:17 Also supporting the case might be that GDP print that we saw for the last

27:21 quarter of 2023 that was subdued growth. So this might also pile on pressure for

27:26 the RBA to start its easing cycle 20. Absolutely.

27:32 We will be watching for all of those moves.

27:34 April, thank you. That's April Hong in our Singapore

27:36 studio. Saudi Arabia is seeking to attract as

27:39 much as $80 billion in private investment to fuel tourism.

27:43 The government is planning to spend around $800 billion over the next decade

27:46 as it prepares for a post-oil future. Let's bring in Kata Haque, chief

27:51 economist and head of research at Emirates, N.V., who says the kingdom's

27:54 budget deficit will widen as investment spending continues.

27:57 I think that's a given but cannot continue to spend at these levels.

28:01 At what point does it need to rein itself in?

28:04 I think we are already seeing some indications from ministers that they are

28:07 looking at some projects that perhaps haven't been announced yet can be scaled

28:13 back or delayed in some way. But I think there is a limit to what

28:16 Saudi Arabia can cut in terms of its investment, because they have got some

28:21 pretty aggressive deliverables and they do need to host some big events and they

28:26 need to be ready for those events, which means infrastructure needs to be built

28:29 and delivered by the end of the decade effectively.

28:33 So I think, you know, we are still of the view that the investment in

28:38 infrastructure and the giga projects will continue almost regardless of where

28:43 the oil price is, even if it means that they've got to go out and borrow more in

28:47 order to fund their budget deficit. And will they be able to do that pretty

28:51 easily? I mean, we are looking at growth this

28:53 year, which is better than last year. Right.

28:55 And the economic fundamentals seem okay. And tourism wise, 100 million tourists

28:59 and 2023, albeit mostly local. Yeah, I think the economy is held up

29:04 very well against a backdrop of much higher interest rates.

29:08 And we've seen that in the UAE as well. Very solid non-oil sector growth in 2023

29:12 in the region of 45%. We're expecting a similar level of

29:16 non-oil sector growth this year in Saudi as well.

29:19 And then, of course, as we see those rate cuts feeding through, hopefully in

29:22 the second half of the year, that should provide some support and ease some of

29:26 the financial strain perhaps on firms that want to borrow to invest in 2025.

29:31 Saudi also very much wants to develop its debt capital markets.

29:35 Right. Would this be a way to do it, to issue

29:37 bonds and have it have money raised that way even more?

29:40 Yes. I mean, we've already seen them issue

29:42 significant amounts, both in terms of the sovereign in January and also the

29:46 public investment fund came to the market with both conventional bond and

29:51 Sukuk. So I do think that that will continue.

29:54 I think they may need to tap external capital markets again later this year.

29:58 But they are also issuing domestically, of course, most of those bonds are

30:03 bought by local banks and held. They're not really traded a huge amount,

30:07 but certainly they are looking to deepen local capital markets.

30:11 And that's part of a push across the region, really.

30:13 Yeah, for sure. And the more foreign investors that come

30:16 in, you know, the better structure those markets will be.

30:20 Can we move to Egypt? Because we have seen since the big

30:23 announcement of the investment that, you know, 12 month forwards on the Egyptian

30:27 pound have really come in and we think we're around 52 now.

30:29 We were down 4748 at one point. Are we out of the woods a little bit for

30:33 the Egyptian pound or does the devaluation need to happen as quickly as

30:36 it might have needed to otherwise? Well, I think in the short term, clearly

30:41 there is a bit of space. So we have had some inflows last week

30:45 already with the Russell Purchase and we are expecting to see more in a couple of

30:51 months time. Our view is that the government should

30:55 really use this opportunity to move ahead with the devaluation because they

30:58 do now have foreign exchange reserves that they can use to kind of manage

31:02 perhaps the demand side and provide that additional supply of dollars into the

31:06 market. But we haven't yet seen an announcement

31:09 of a devaluation. So we're waiting for that.

31:12 We do think they will need to devalue at some point.

31:15 They probably could wait a bit, but we would hope that they do it sooner rather

31:19 than later. It's interesting, though, because this

31:20 sort of did the first devaluation for them.

31:23 Right. As long as they hold at these levels, is

31:26 there a possibility that we'll start creeping higher again?

31:29 Yes, I think if the government doesn't actually, you know, strike while the

31:32 iron is hot, I think we will start to see those 12 month forwards pick up

31:36 again. You know, if they do a devaluation and

31:39 are able to bring the the the parallel market and the official rate closer

31:43 together, then I think that provides a bit of confidence to investors and, you

31:48 know, other parties as well. And hopefully that moves forward with

31:52 with the IMF deal, which again, is potentially a significant source of

31:56 support. But they will only provide those funds

32:00 if the government is able to move to flexible exchange rates.

32:03 I think that is key. Foreign direct investment.

32:06 Where do you see it mostly going in the region this year?

32:08 I mean, does it go everywhere or are there particular markets that are very

32:11 hard right now? So we've seen the UAE really attract the

32:14 most in terms of foreign direct investment over the last couple of years

32:17 in the region. That has really gone into the key

32:23 sectors that we've seen tourism increasingly software and business

32:27 services. Renewable energy has been a big source.

32:30 Of FDI into both Saudi Arabia and the UAE and also in Egypt.

32:35 If we look back over the last three or four years.

32:38 So we think given the strong growth, given the amount of public sector

32:41 investment that's going to be happening, particularly in the UAE and Saudi

32:45 Arabia, we think there is going to be appetite and investment coming in to

32:50 support those projects over the long term.

32:52 Yeah, we're just taking a look at the last years for many of the regional

32:55 markets. And, you know, it's really interesting.

32:57 Some of them are shooting higher. I mean, this is all just can't be

33:00 stopped. Right?

33:01 And even Egypt's main index has risen something like 23% this year.

33:05 So there's a lot of hope in the region, it would seem.

33:08 Talk to us a little bit about Turkey having difficulty.

33:11 Obviously, with inflation, it could go up as high as 73%, according to

33:15 Bloomberg Intelligence. Is that where you see it added?

33:18 We are of the view that inflation will slow and we will have support of base

33:23 effects to help bring it down in the second half of the year.

33:25 And we also have a central bank that is committed to bringing inflation down.

33:31 We think they probably have done what they need to do in terms of rate hikes,

33:35 but we certainly aren't looking for easing anytime soon on Turkey.

33:39 But I think as long as they're able to push ahead with the fiscal policy

33:44 reforms that they need to make and the conventional monetary policy that

33:48 they've been pursuing over the last year and a half, you know, that should

33:52 continue to see inflation trend lower when, you know, clients come and ask you

33:59 for recommendations. I mean, it's not you know, you're saying

34:01 you're head of research and chief economist, but you know, what is

34:05 Emirates saying in terms of recommendations for this region?

34:08 We are very positive on the UAE and Saudi Arabia, not just for 2024, but

34:12 really over the medium term. We see it as a long term growth story.

34:17 There is a huge amount of structural reform which is happening in these

34:19 economies, which we think is going to drive investment over the medium term.

34:24 And we're very optimistic about the the outlook for these economies and their

34:29 diversification goals and the push that they're making to really diversify not

34:34 just onshore but also the balance of payments.

34:37 So we're looking at growth and services, we're looking at bringing in high tech

34:41 manufacturing and skills and investment from firms that can bring technology as

34:46 well. So I think all of these bode well.

34:48 And I think when we look at the performance of these economies relative

34:51 to what we're seeing in advanced economies and in many emerging markets,

34:55 the growth story really is very positive compared to what we're seeing elsewhere

34:59 in the world. Khadijah, thank you so much for joining

35:02 us and particularly in our Dubai studio this morning.

35:04 That is because he's a hack chief economist and head of research at

35:07 Emirates and Mehdi, Qatar Airways says traffic jumped by 31%

35:12 in the first two months of the year as the Gulf carrier expanded its network to

35:16 new destinations, as well as increasing trips on 15 major routes.

35:21 Chief Commercial Officer Terry Antonioni told Bloomberg the airline is benefiting

35:25 from resurging travel demand after the pandemic.

35:32 We will enter a phase. We as a strong airline, will continue to

35:36 grow fast and go well. But where the gap between the best and

35:41 the second tier may increase more than maybe one year ago, where everybody was

35:47 benefiting from the bottlenecks. In India, demand

35:51 is a supply story. Where is the.

35:53 Where is the supply? Where is the demand coming from?

35:56 Which routes are strongest right now? Which parts of the plane are working

36:00 best for you? We have a chance as a Qatar Airways to

36:05 be a kind of a geographically very well positioned

36:10 airline between the between Asia Australasia and Europe, between Africa

36:16 and Europe and Asia. So we can capture globally almost all

36:21 the flows except the transatlantic flows and the Trans-Pacific flows.

36:25 And so is the geographical, geographical location of the are we we capture a bit

36:31 of everything, but we have a very, very strong demand between Europe and Asia

36:36 and Australia, Malaysia's these days. Regarding the cabin, because we are also

36:41 now aligned to having also a broader segment of customers premium Malaysia

36:48 cooperate, everything coming well, we are not a pure, pure corporate airline

36:53 like some of our European peer. So we were able to fill our aircraft

36:58 with a very good premium Malaysia demand between Europe and, for instance,

37:02 Southeast Asia. But in the corporate space we are doing

37:05 well thanks to the quality of our product and the quality of our hub in

37:08 Doha. And even if the corporate market is

37:13 recovering slower and still not industry wise at the level of pre-COVID, Qatar

37:18 Airways, you're already 35% above pre-COVID levels regarding the corporate

37:24 business. So all cabin and mainly the European,

37:29 Asian and Africa flows are giving us a source of satisfaction.

37:33 That is. That was Qatar Airways chief commercial

37:38 officer Terry Antinori. Plenty more still ahead on DAYBREAK,

37:42 Middle East and Africa. This is Bloomberg.

38:03 Let's get more now on the M&A deal between a French media giant and South

38:07 Africa's biggest broadcaster. Canal Canal+ has boosted its bid for

38:11 MultiChoice by almost a fifth as it enters exclusive talks on acquiring

38:16 control of the African broadcaster. Bloomberg's on Ontario Congo joins us

38:19 now from Kigali. So Vivendi increases its offer.

38:23 Why under Ole? Mm hmm.

38:27 I think the reason speaks for itself. They know the value that MultiChoice

38:32 brings on the table. And a lot has happened ever since they

38:35 made their first offer. We've seen MultiChoice has increased by

38:39 52% since the 1st of February. And since Tuesday, when this new

38:43 announcement was made, MultiChoice offers about 4.7%.

38:47 Now, speaking on the matter, the CEO of Canal Plus and also the chairperson says

38:51 that they have enough and valuable insights into MultiChoice and that's why

38:56 they've offered the new price of 125 runs per share, up from 105, bringing

39:01 the company's total valuation to $2.9 billion.

39:05 Now, conversations are ongoing with JPMorgan and Bank of America to draft a

39:10 formal offer, and MultiChoice, on the other hand, is going to constitute an

39:14 independent board to be able to make recommendations based off of this offer.

39:22 What is the significance of this deal to Canal Plus?

39:29 It opens them up to way more subscribers.

39:32 Plus has a subscriber base of 8 million across Francophone MultiChoice.

39:37 On the other hand, 23 million subscribers.

39:40 So this buyout opens them up to over 50 African countries in the sub-Saharan

39:47 region where MultiChoice operates. There are also other advantages.

39:51 Take a look at MultiChoice streaming platform Showmax its leading in terms of

39:55 subscription on the African continent, nearly 40% with Netflix coming in second

40:00 with 1.8 million subscribers compared to Showmax who have 2.1 million

40:04 subscribers. And this growth did not happen in a

40:06 vacuum. They've invested a lot in content.

40:09 They've also partnered with Comcast, NBCU, Universal and also Sky to bring

40:15 live Premier League matches. So Vivendi is hoping that they can grow

40:20 to about 50 million subscribers and Canal Plus is hoping that soon they can

40:24 become one of the top five streaming platforms in the world.

40:30 Ontario, Thank you so much. A fascinating deal which we will

40:33 continue to follow. That is Bloomberg's Ontario Ganga.

40:37 Staying with South Africa now. The nation's economy escaped a technical

40:41 recession in the fourth quarter, with GDP expanding 0.1% in the final three

40:45 months of last year, Southern Africa's biggest economy benefited from fewer

40:50 power cuts, which helped a rebound of energy intensive industries, including

40:54 mining growth for the full year came in at 0.6%.

40:58 That compares with 1.9% growth in 2020 to the economy's lackluster performance

41:04 last year was partly caused by logistical challenges at a state owned

41:08 course and by rail operator. Is that hit exports?

41:13 Plenty more is still ahead. This is Bloomberg.

41:34 Dubai's latest IPO sold out in minutes yesterday with investors rushing to snap

41:38 up shares in the city's public parking business.

41:41 Let's get back into Middle East markets now with our equities reporter Fara El

41:44 Bakraoui. So far, you were anticipating that there

41:47 might be some excitement around this. Within minutes, though, literally within

41:51 minutes, as soon as the books open. Vonnie it was fully covered, basically.

41:56 So, so much excitement for dubai. Parken

42:00 we were just talking about how busy the city is and they expect the demand for

42:05 parking to rise by 60% by 2033. So that's, you know, a lot of demand and

42:10 a lot of excitement on that front. And it is a play on device cyclicality

42:14 on its population growth. And we did see a lot of investors coming

42:18 in on that front. Dubai government is selling a 25% stake

42:22 in this company. And it is this will be the sixth one out

42:27 of the ten state companies that it has promised the market.

42:31 Its price range is currently between two drums and 2.1 dirhams potentially

42:36 raising as much as 429 $429 million.

42:42 So was there a strategic reason for them pricing at that price when there was

42:46 obviously so much demand that they could have potentially priced higher now?

42:50 Well, you could also argue that they want to leave a little bit more for when

42:54 the stock actually goes to the market for people to be able to snap up the

42:58 shares. You know, the question is, how does that

43:01 affect volumes as well? So definitely create some participation

43:05 if not everyone gets the allocation that they want.

43:07 Everyone will be watching for the dividend yield, which is a very

43:10 important player in the Dubai market at the moment.

43:13 So that's for it to buy a person and we'll see where it prices.

43:18 Now we're seeing layoffs at Starbucks in the Middle East, slashing jobs, in fact.

43:22 What's behind it, Fara? Absolutely.

43:24 So al-Sharia, which is the license partner for the chain in the region for

43:29 a decade now with about 1300 locations across the MENA region, has eliminated

43:35 2000 jobs and which reduces Starbucks workforce in the region by 20%.

43:42 And that's in response to what they say is challenging trading conditions.

43:46 And we do know that there have been very a lot of calls for boycotts of Starbucks

43:52 for not doing more potentially for its response to Israel's war in Gaza and

43:57 Gaza so that we know that Starbucks itself, Starbucks Corp has said that it

44:03 has seen a significant hit on traffic in the Middle East in its most recent

44:08 earnings. And that's clearly starting to show up

44:11 in the workforce by a Shia. Yeah, so fascinating.

44:14 Kara, thank you so much for those updates that Sara el Barbie, our

44:17 equities reporter here. Now some top stories we're following

44:21 corporate wise on the Bloomberg. Alibaba is leading a financing round of

44:25 at least $600 million for the Chinese startup Minimax.

44:30 Our sources say the funding will value minimax on more than two and a half

44:33 billion dollars. We're also told that hongshan is among

44:36 the committed investors. It's Alibaba's second major deal in the

44:40 sector this year as it seeks to beef up its air portfolio.

44:45 Bloomberg has learned that the largest U.S.

44:47 public pension fund is looking externally for its next chief investment

44:50 officer. Sources say CalPERS is shortlist of four

44:54 candidates includes Jonathan Global, CIO of the Los Angeles County Employees

44:59 Retirement Association. The $490 billion fund has had four CEOs

45:04 since 2009. Citigroup's CEO Jane Fraser says her

45:10 reorganization, aimed at streamlining the bank and making it more competitive,

45:14 has gone faster than expected. Frazier told a banking conference in New

45:17 York that Citi is not going to repeat mistakes it has made in the past.

45:21 The bank is cutting 20,000 jobs in its bid to boost returns.

45:27 Let's have a look at how markets are shaping up then for the Wednesday

45:30 trading session. Equity futures pointed higher, at least

45:33 for now, particularly Dow and NASDAQ 100 futures.

45:37 The Nasdaq itself was down about 1.8% yesterday.

45:40 Not particularly good news for tech stocks out of China, although we are

45:44 seeing a major rebound for the Hang Seng and the technology shares in Hong Kong

45:50 and across the mainland as well today. We have Dow futures obviously unchanged,

45:54 zero stocks futures look to be pointed to a higher open there, Treasuries wise.

45:58 Well, that market will be listening to Fed Chair Jay Powell later on be of the

46:01 ten year yield at four 1413 and declining to a certain extent.

46:06 And then let's take a quick look at oil and bitcoin oil continuing to hold up in

46:10 spite of us being awash in supply. Stay tuned.

46:15 This is Bloomberg.

46:39 This is Bloomberg Daybreak, Middle East and Africa.

46:41 Our top stories this morning. Super Tuesday sees Biden and Trump win

46:46 big in the most important round of primary contests.

46:49 But Vermont is called for Nikki Haley. We'll bring you all the latest as the

46:53 results come in. Stocks in Hong Kong rebound as markets

46:57 look ahead to testimony from Fed Chair Jay Powell.

47:00 And Bitcoin, though, gives investors vertigo, hitting an all time high before

47:04 plunging nearly $10,000 in just a few hours.

47:08 Plus, China's, but China's bullish growth target leaves investors looking

47:12 for more details. Top officials from the central bank and

47:14 the securities regulator are set to hold a briefing later today and will be

47:18 paying close attention to that. But it is just past 9 a.m.

47:22 across the Emirates, 7 a.m. here in Johannesburg.

47:24 I'm Jennifer Isabella. Sergeant, nice to be with you this

47:26 morning. A quick check on how markets are shaping

47:29 up this morning for this Wednesday morning.

47:30 It's been a busy day. Right now.

47:31 We're seeing futures pointing slightly higher, as you can see right there.

47:35 The S&P at 5090, but that coming after a Tuesday where the S&P dropped about a

47:42 1%. NASDAQ futures also suggesting

47:45 potentially a rebound. But again, Tuesday was a difficult day

47:49 for the Nasdaq after it saw its biggest drop in weeks as both Tesla and Apple

47:54 fall. The ten year right now, looking at 41

47:57 for 67, we saw a weaker ISM services index on Tuesday that sent yields down.

48:04 As we mentioned, we're going to be hearing from Jay Powell later today.

48:06 Question is whether or not that will have an impact on the ten year and Brent

48:10 crude hovering around $82 a barrel. That's steadying after dropping about

48:15 9/10 of a percent on Tuesday. We got a report on Tuesday that showed

48:19 U.S. inventories are continuing to expand,

48:22 potentially bringing, again, this issue about supply and demand back into the

48:26 fore. And the big story we mentioned is at the

48:28 top of the show, both Bitcoin and gold reaching new highs on Tuesday, really

48:33 having a Super Tuesday. If you take a look at that gold, if you

48:36 look at this chart maintaining that upside.

48:40 Bitcoin, on the other hand, plunging after reaching its high, still of course

48:45 seeing a bit of upside. But clearly we're seeing a number of

48:49 traders taking the opportunity to take a little bit of profit with these latest

48:52 moves. So busy day.

48:54 All right. Let's get to markets in Asia and see how

48:57 they're faring. Avery Hong is in our Singapore studio.

48:59 Hey, April. Hey, Danielle, we're seeing a mixed bag

49:04 in Asia Pacific Equities, the Nikkei, Cosby, they've been struggling a little

49:09 today, but the Hang Seng is surging two plus percent, helped along by gains in

49:14 tech stocks. Key among them, JD.com, ahead of its

49:17 earnings. There is some optimism that it's going

49:20 to be able to beat the competition by, I think, the primary focus for investors a

49:25 day after the NPC with a growth the budget deficit target disappointed will

49:30 be the press briefing from senior officials, including the PBOC governor

49:35 and the chiefs of the Commerce as well as finance ministry perhaps gives us

49:39 some clues on how they intend to boost consumption, how they intend to bring in

49:43 the private sector for that buzz phrase, new productive forces.

49:48 Are we also seeing bonds extending their rally Now flip the board, because

49:52 something else we've been seeing in China is that Hong Kong, China, that

49:58 stock benchmark, has been doing well, but margin trading has also been

50:01 rebounding. And this could be a sign of risk

50:04 sentiment returning to the markets potentially.

50:07 What we saw yesterday was an overt doing of the selling, Jen.

50:13 April, thanks so much for that update. We'll check in with you later today.

50:16 Our other top story. Former President Donald Trump is

50:19 sweeping Republican primaries moving closer to clinching the party's

50:23 nomination. Former governor of South Carolina Nikki

50:26 Haley, though, has scored her first primary victory in the state of Vermont.

50:30 President Biden has so far won all Democratic contests.

50:34 Let's get the latest from Bloomberg's US government editor Jon Harney, who I

50:38 imagine has been up all night covering this.

50:40 So, John, a bit of inevitable inevitability when it comes to these

50:43 results. But but how are you reading into this?

50:45 What are the big takeaways from the night?

50:48 Well, of course, Trump did very well. He needs 215 delegates to win.

50:57 After tonight, he should have close to 1100.

51:00 So he does not yet have the nomination, but he almost certainly will by the

51:05 middle of the month or at the latest, by March 19th, when other big states like

51:12 Ohio and Illinois fold. So, yeah, it was a major triumph for him

51:19 tonight. And now it's pretty much on to the

51:24 general election, although Nikki Haley has yet to leave the race.

51:30 Yeah, and let's just stick on that, John, because we are looking at pictures

51:33 of Nikki Haley and Donald Trump. And really the big question was, does

51:36 Nikki Haley stay in this past Super Tuesday?

51:39 Considering what we did see on Tuesday? I mean, where does this leave her?

51:44 Well, of course, as you said, as you pointed out, she won Vermont.

51:47 She won the District of Columbia. She won the District of Columbia

51:50 primary here last weekend. So, you know, she hasn't been completely

51:56 shut out. But, you know, it's a case of

51:58 diminishing returns. She you know, once Trump was Donald

52:03 Trump win, you know, get to 12 or 15 delegates, it's over.

52:08 So she did not drop out tonight, as some had speculated.

52:12 But her you know, her her campaign does not have much further to go.

52:20 And John, when we think about what will likely be the match up that we're going

52:25 to see in a few months time. I mean, what is it that that voters are

52:28 going to be voting on? Is it going to be domestic issues?

52:31 We heard Donald Trump talking about inflation and the economy last night.

52:35 Is it going to be foreign policy in terms of what's happening in the Middle

52:38 East? I mean, what is it that that you think

52:40 voters are really going to hone in on? Well, of course, you know, it's it's

52:46 difficult to predict. I mean, two years ago, I don't think

52:49 anyone thought that Russia or more than two years ago, I don't think

52:54 anybody thought Russia would invade Ukraine.

52:57 It's going it's going to be the economy is going to be a big factor, of course.

53:01 Yes. Immigration is has become an enormous

53:06 and enormous issue that weighs on the minds of voters.

53:09 So and then and then, of course, there are Donald Trump's trials coming up.

53:14 He has on one of them starts in New York, a state trial, March 25.

53:19 Others others may begin this year. So

53:26 there's always in every election, there's always you always have to

53:31 predict some unpredictability. I think that's the best way to put it.

53:37 John Harney, Bloomberg's US government editor, staying up for us in DC.

53:41 John, great to speak with you today. Now on to China and day two of the key

53:46 National People's Congress gathering well underway in Beijing.

53:49 Markets are digesting the latest comments from President Xi Jinping

53:53 calling for local government to develop, quote, new productive forces as China

53:58 works to meet its 5% growth target. For more, let's bring in our Asia

54:02 government and economy correspondent Rebecca chang Wilkins.

54:04 So, Rebecca, I heard Averil earlier calling this the buzzword.

54:08 I mean, what are you making of these comments here from President Xi?

54:13 Well, we first heard this catch phrase from President Xi back in September when

54:16 he was doing a tour of northwestern China.

54:20 And like many of these catch phrases, it's sort of quite vague in its

54:24 specificity. But the idea of productive forces

54:28 actually touches on Marxist theory, and it's now sort of likely to be enshrined

54:33 in other party documents. It seems to be the ways in which Xi

54:37 Jinping, you sort of encapsulating his new vision, his new projection of what

54:41 his model of the economy is going to be. State media has sort of tried to provide

54:46 some kind of clarity over what it could mean.

54:48 They haven't done much. They've said it can refer to everything

54:51 from tourism to the so-called three forces, that's EVs, batteries and

54:56 renewables. So we're really waiting to see what new

54:59 meat sort of is on the bone when it comes to specifically what this means.

55:03 But I think we can expect to hear much more from it.

55:06 And the People's Daily, in fact, has put it today on their list of buzz words.

55:12 Oh, wow. And the year is still only just getting

55:14 started, Rebecca. I mean, and the big question after we

55:17 heard about this 5% target on Tuesday was whether or not China can actually

55:21 achieve this growth. I mean, is is there the expectation that

55:25 China can and our markets convinced. Yeah.

55:30 I think investors, by and large have been pretty underwhelmed.

55:34 And part of that is the lack of clarity over precisely how we get to that 5%

55:38 target, particularly because China so far has said the fiscal deficit is going

55:43 to be 3%, implying not that much debt. So really how we get from there to 5% is

55:48 going to be a heavy lift and in fact, a much heavier lift.

55:52 The last year where we were coming off a very low base because of COVID and

55:55 lockdowns that were still sort of across China.

55:59 This year, it's going to be tough. And I think the lack of clarity and

56:03 particularly the absence of a briefing that we usually expect from the Premier

56:08 that comes at the NPC, which may have provided a bit more clarity over sort of

56:13 a bit more confidence to to investors over precisely what the plan was.

56:17 The absence of that, I think has sort of re reinforced these concerns about

56:23 precisely the nature of Beijing's plan to get to that very ambitious target.

56:29 So then if we're not looking out for that briefing that traditionally happens

56:33 at the end of the NPC. Rebecca, what is it that we're looking

56:35 out for next? What is the big headline we're waiting

56:37 for? Yeah, so if the PBOC does have a joint

56:42 briefing and we're expecting that to come and news to come from that today

56:46 and that has become more important, I think in the absence of that premier

56:50 briefing, as you say, and a couple of things to watch from that.

56:53 I mean Pangong Sheng Governor Pangong Cheng tends to be quite newsy in these

56:57 briefings. For example, he introduced news about

57:00 the trip a la carte in his January briefing.

57:03 So investors will be looking, I think, closely at him to see what precisely he

57:07 says. And this is also going to be sort of the

57:09 first big public presentation by the new head of the CSC.

57:14 That is the regulator that was sort of abruptly put in place after that stock

57:19 market meltdown that we had just a few weeks ago.

57:23 Now, this this character watching characterises the broker Berkshire.

57:27 He's known as sort of a hard liner on firms that are doing and financial firms

57:31 that are doing wrongdoing. So I think those are sort of the two

57:34 characters that will be looking closely at today.

57:39 Great to get that color from you. Asia Government and economy

57:42 correspondent Rebecca Chung Wilkins. Rebecca, great to have you on this

57:45 morning. Thanks so much.

57:46 All right. Still ahead, we'll talk global market

57:49 strategy with the CIO of bank size. With the Fed's rate path and China's

57:53 growth plan in focus. Stick with us.

57:56 This is Bloomberg.

58:21 SLB CEO says that he's not surprised to see the oil industry consolidating.

58:26 He told Bloomberg's Alix Steel his energy sector outlook at Bloomberg's NRF

58:31 and annual Barrel of Tomorrow forum in Houston.

58:34 Take a listen. Mid reset is at the record high level of

58:39 investment combined with the old capacity expansion in Saudi, but in

58:45 other over country UAE, Kuwait and the rubbing off of Iraq or Libya, further

58:50 expansion. Secondly, in the entire Middle East

58:54 region, gas is becoming a critical priority and more conventional gas like

59:01 cattle is developing for energy export or unconventional and conventional gas

59:06 for for local consumption or for replacement of oil or in production.

59:11 So if Saudi Aramco stays conservative like it, does it start to bite in like

59:15 2025, 2026? No, I don't think they are conservative.

59:19 I was there for a week three weeks ago, and the activity is as high as we has

59:24 ever been and ever seen in the Middle East and North Korea.

59:29 In Saudi, it is such it's very, very strong.

59:32 And we got a high line activity and we've got high offshore activity.

59:37 This expansion that was supposed to happen is at the moment suspended,

59:40 delayed, could come back because it could provide an over 1 million buy in

59:45 addition from offshore. We happen to be very well exposed and

59:49 very long on onshore exposure because of our integrated contract.

59:53 We happen to be also extremely well exposed to gas in Saudi.

59:57 So for us is minimum or immaterial impact for this year for sure and for

01:00:01 the foreseeable future. We see growth this year, very

01:00:04 significant growth in all or almost all the country.

01:00:07 Middle East wants to build this activity, momentum to continue into next

01:00:12 year. And this change of of two projects that

01:00:15 have been postponed, that has been cancelled, that do not impose on more

01:00:18 than 1% of the total upstream spend per year is not changing.

01:00:24 Our strategy is not changing. The game is not changing.

01:00:27 What is the largest and biggest investment cycle in Middle East.

01:00:31 And that is very good perspective to keep in that when we hear these

01:00:33 headlines that they cross. So just to wrap up.

01:00:36 Speaking of Saudi Arabia, we just saw Opec+ continue the extension of their

01:00:41 cuts. Is 80 a floor, a top like how do you see

01:00:45 the oil market? Where's the band?

01:00:47 The band has been I think OPEC has been willing to to set the floor up 80 or

01:00:52 more. The oil price has stood between 7585

01:00:57 once spread to this market to stay, to stay as such, because they'll back will

01:01:02 continue to use opec+ continue to use their opportunity to adjust to the

01:01:06 market, to the market demand supply equation.

01:01:10 As you can see, the maturity of the US market starting to go towards production

01:01:18 plateau. We create more pool on international

01:01:21 liquid demand and gas activity to actually continue to expand due to gas

01:01:26 security. So this combination will continue to

01:01:29 push and support activity outlook and I'm not willing to predict, we will not

01:01:33 predict on price, but we believe that the the balance of impact plus the

01:01:39 continued pull on international supply that will stretch the existing resource

01:01:44 basins internationally will continue to support very healthy oil prices going

01:01:48 forward. And that was the sub CEO there speaking

01:01:53 with our Alix Steel. Let's turn now to markets.

01:01:56 Investors are looking ahead to a news conference at China's policy meeting.

01:02:00 And later today, fed chair jay Powell is congressional testimony.

01:02:04 Stocks in Asia are trading broadly higher.

01:02:07 Let's bring in charles on Raymond Chow, the chief investment officer at Bank

01:02:11 XYZ, joining us from our Dubai studio. So, Charles Henry, great to have you.

01:02:15 I want to start in China because we were talking about this new buzz word that we

01:02:19 got from the president about new productive forces.

01:02:22 It still seems like markets and investors need a little bit more

01:02:26 convincing in terms of confidence in this economy.

01:02:29 What is it that you're going to be paying attention to when we get this

01:02:32 briefing later today? Well, you know, looking at what we

01:02:38 heard, you know, since the start of the of the week, there was no, let's say,

01:02:42 big news coming. So we heard about fiscal forward

01:02:46 guidance, but nothing on the wholesale consumption and also related markets.

01:02:51 So anything which is bringing positive surprises on these tools or household

01:02:57 consumption and we states could be a good news for the market.

01:03:00 But for the rest, you know, it seems that we'll be able to get these 5% GDP

01:03:05 growth this year, but that is not allaying, you know, market concerns.

01:03:10 So I'm afraid that despite the fact that this sentiment is over, swords

01:03:14 valuations are quite attractive. We still don't get the kind of stimulus

01:03:18 that the market is waiting for. What does that mean then for equities?

01:03:23 I mean, is the expectation that their hold where they are or could we

01:03:27 potentially see more downside if we don't get some of those details?

01:03:33 Well, we know there's a national team which is making sure that we don't,

01:03:38 let's say, drop much further. But I'm afraid that's for the time being

01:03:43 when it comes to foreign flows. We are still not there yet.

01:03:46 It's it could be that's a short term tactical call, but they're on all sides.

01:03:50 We continue to avoid this part of global markets.

01:03:53 There are other, let's say, interesting markets to play with in emerging

01:03:58 markets. And this is one so trying to equities

01:04:01 that we still avoid. And I know Japan is one of those

01:04:05 interesting markets that you and your team are looking to.

01:04:08 Is that correct? Yeah that's correct that we've been

01:04:13 position on and Japan's for quite some time now.

01:04:17 The rally has been quite interesting. But when you look at valuations and when

01:04:21 you look at the catalysts, we believe that there is some upside on these

01:04:24 markets. So that's the one we are looking at in

01:04:27 Asia, India, Indonesia are also very interesting markets.

01:04:31 But again, for the time being we are watching China.

01:04:35 Let's talk to us, Charles Andre, because we are, as we mentioned, still seeing

01:04:40 some upside, although we saw some downside in terms of tech dragging down

01:04:44 the Nasdaq on Tuesday. Are you still overweight in the U.S.

01:04:48 and how much momentum do you think equities really have have to go right

01:04:53 now? Yeah, well, no.

01:04:57 First, we believe that currency macro conditions so nominal gross, ac

01:05:02 favorable to equities, equities have been performing bonds for quite some

01:05:06 time now when it comes to U.S. is still the most attractive markets.

01:05:10 Yes, we did see some pullback yesterday, which is not quite normal.

01:05:14 I know it has been almost two year without a 2% drop in the S&P 500.

01:05:19 So it will not be a surprise to see some pullback.

01:05:22 Yes. The fact that the US equity market,

01:05:26 possibly tech is overvalued, overcrowded is not a problem until it gets a problem

01:05:32 becomes a problem. So, again, you know, some volatility

01:05:35 could be expected, but this is still a part of the market that we favor.

01:05:41 So you don't see potentially froth coming into the market because we've

01:05:44 heard some start to insinuate that maybe that is what we're seeing, maybe we're

01:05:49 reaching a bubble status. Yeah.

01:05:54 So it's kind of overstretch in terms of positioning that.

01:05:57 That's for sure. It's not cheaper.

01:05:59 But when you look, for instance, at the large cap tech stocks, they are

01:06:03 expensive for a reason. You know that if you look at earnings

01:06:06 revision, for instance, it has been positive they are better position in

01:06:10 terms of sales and margin expectations for the years to come.

01:06:14 But I think yesterday the key catalyst was China.

01:06:18 We know that the relationship between us and China is breaking.

01:06:21 It was not just about Apple. You probably saw AMD, AMD they had this

01:06:25 issue with, you know, when they want to export chips to China, they need to have

01:06:29 a another a special license. So China is not only weighing that's on

01:06:33 the local market, but also on what could happen on the tech sides.

01:06:38 So clearly that was a catalyst. Doesn't seem to be monitor it.

01:06:41 But see, in the medium term, we still like, you know, tech and US stocks.

01:06:46 And we also, you know, we're waiting for Fed Chair Powell.

01:06:49 He's going to be testifying today. But then we also get a jobs numbers on

01:06:53 Friday. I mean, could either of these

01:06:55 potentially affect your current portfolio positioning?

01:07:01 I think the key point here is that if you look at the Fed's rate cut

01:07:05 expectations, we have moved from 6 to 7 rate cuts expected at the start of

01:07:09 February to just three. In the meantime, the market has rallied.

01:07:13 Why is that? Because so far, the good news on the

01:07:16 earnings side, the good news of them on the growth side are offsetting the fact

01:07:21 that, you know, we are pulling back in terms of rate growth expectations.

01:07:25 If, you know, we still gets positive growth momentum and inflation, which is

01:07:31 not. We are eating too much.

01:07:33 We are seeing the sweet spots. If we get any news which are getting

01:07:37 into the direction of stagflation risk, then you will see a pull back, you know,

01:07:41 from the markets. So when it comes to Mr.

01:07:43 Powell today, we don't expect much. We believe that the message will be

01:07:48 okay. We have made some progress, but we are

01:07:49 still not there yet. We are still that are dependent.

01:07:51 So no big news awaited. But still, I would like to see some

01:07:55 comments, some follow up on what we heard last week from Fed Governor

01:08:00 Christopher Walter about this Operation Reverse twist.

01:08:03 I think that came as a shocker on Friday.

01:08:05 So maybe we'll get some more color on this today.

01:08:09 Right. I didn't even get to talk to you about

01:08:11 gold and Bitcoin. Hopefully next time.

01:08:13 Charles on Montreal bank Size Chief Investment Officer, thanks so much for

01:08:17 joining us in Dubai. All right.

01:08:18 Plenty more still ahead. Stick with us.

01:08:20 This is Bloomberg.

01:08:37 Let's take a quick check on markets before we take you to our next block.

01:08:41 This is a look at Middle East markets right now and where they closed last.

01:08:45 But we see a bit of downside for some of the Mideast markets.

01:08:48 But the Dow seeing saw some upside. They are closing at about 3/10 of a

01:08:53 percent up. Let's take a look at more broadly where

01:08:57 futures are pointing right now, because Tuesday was a difficult session for a

01:09:01 number of the indices. The S&P dropped on Tuesday.

01:09:05 The Nasdaq also dropped with Tesla and Apple really leading the declines, but

01:09:09 potentially a rebound we're looking at today.

01:09:11 Euro Stoxx 50 futures also seeing some upside.

01:09:14 All right, stick with us. This is bloomberg.

01:09:40 This is Bloomberg Daybreak, Middle East and Africa.

01:09:43 Our top stories this morning. Super Tuesday sees Biden and Trump win

01:09:47 big in the most important round of primary contests.

01:09:50 But Vermont is called for Nikki Haley. We'll bring you all the latest as the

01:09:55 results come in. Stocks in Hong Kong rebound as markets

01:09:58 look ahead to testimony from Fed Chair Jay Powell.

01:10:02 Bitcoin gives investors vertigo, hitting an all time high before plunging nearly

01:10:06 $10,000 in just a few hours. Plus, China's bullish growth target

01:10:12 leaves investors looking for more details.

01:10:14 Top officials from the central bank and the securities regulator are set to hold

01:10:18 a briefing later today. We'll be paying close attention to that.

01:10:22 It is just past 9:30 a.m. across the Emirates, 7:30 a.m.

01:10:25 here in Johannesburg. I'm Jennifer Zambezia.

01:10:28 A quick check on where markets are. Right now, we're seeing futures edging

01:10:32 slightly higher for the start of Wednesday's session.

01:10:35 If you can see, S&P futures, they're up nearly 3/10 of a percent, but that is

01:10:39 coming after a Tuesday drop that saw the index close, a drop about 1%.

01:10:46 Nasdaq futures also potentially suggesting some upside here after seeing

01:10:51 its biggest drop in weeks on Tuesday, that as Tesla and Apple both fall.

01:10:56 The ten year is remaining pretty steady. If we can see right there.

01:10:59 It's at four one, four, six, seven and Brent crude.

01:11:03 Brent crude is up about 2/10 of a percent.

01:11:06 Interesting. It's just about 80 to 22 right there,

01:11:09 dollars. It saw a drop on Tuesday after a report

01:11:13 showed that U.S. inventories are continuing to expand

01:11:16 that potentially bringing this question about supply and demand back into the

01:11:21 fore. But let's take a look at the big highs,

01:11:23 the new highs that we saw on Tuesday, which are Bitcoin and gold, both of them

01:11:28 reaching new highs on Tuesday. Bitcoin with its all time high.

01:11:31 And as you can see from this chart, gold was able to maintain that upside.

01:11:36 Bitcoin, though, as we mentioned at the top of the show plunging after reaching

01:11:40 its high. Clearly seeing some opportunity by

01:11:43 traders to take a bit of profit with these latest moves.

01:11:45 We'll see where it goes next. We're going to go next to markets in

01:11:48 Asia, though. Avery Hong is in our Singapore studio.

01:11:50 Hey, Errol. Hey, Jen.

01:11:54 Yeah. As you mentioned a short while ago,

01:11:57 we're seeing Chinese tech stocks rebounding sharply in the afternoon

01:12:01 session. All eyes will be on the press briefing

01:12:04 from the most senior officials, from the commerce, the finance ministry.

01:12:08 But also interesting to see how Japan's Cros asset picture is shaping up.

01:12:13 The Nikkei has been flat for much of the session.

01:12:17 We're seeing the topics helped along by gains among the mining related stocks.

01:12:22 But something that we've been focusing on is how the Japanese lender, the

01:12:27 biggest among them FMG. It seems to have a more definitive bit

01:12:33 now of when exactly the BOJ will exit negative interest rate policy.

01:12:37 It sees a lift off in March versus what the swaps market is pricing mostly

01:12:42 seeing a move in April, JGBs coming off, we're seeing the yen moving below 150

01:12:49 against the greenback. Certainly the central bank is in focus

01:12:54 in the region. Jan and April.

01:12:57 April, we know you're paying close attention to India's regulator now

01:13:01 cracking down on shadow banks. I mean, what's the significance here for

01:13:04 you? Yeah, absolutely.

01:13:08 I mean, we've seen a move this week on one of the shadow banks, and this is to

01:13:15 kind of bar the kind of lending for what's allowed for these shadow lenders.

01:13:21 So let's talk about maybe let's take a look at how the two of them that are in

01:13:25 focus are faring today. GM Financial I if Elvis was the one that

01:13:30 saw action earlier in the week, it is extending those declines today.

01:13:35 It already lost 20% yesterday. GM financial.

01:13:38 Double digit losses as well. And this is amid the moves by the Indian

01:13:43 regulator to kind of constrain the financial risk in the country.

01:13:50 And shadow bankers certainly in focus. This one is one of systemic importance

01:13:56 in the country, Jen. Everyone.

01:14:00 April, thanks as always for that update. All right.

01:14:02 Let's turn now to Saudi Arabia. It's seeking to attract as much as $80

01:14:07 billion in private investment to fuel tourism.

01:14:10 The government is planning to spend around $800 billion over the next decade

01:14:15 as it prepares for a post-oil future. Let's bring in Bloomberg's Matthew

01:14:20 Martin, who is in Riyadh for us, also wrote the story on the Bloomberg for us.

01:14:25 So, Matthew, give us the assessment here.

01:14:27 Maybe the report card on how this Saudi tourism push is going for the kingdom so

01:14:31 far. Well, so far it's been it's been going

01:14:36 quite well for them, really. I mean, this is a country that until

01:14:40 2019 it was virtually impossible for anyone to visit in terms of leisure

01:14:46 travel. And even if you could get a visit, then

01:14:49 the infrastructure was not there at all for you once you arrived.

01:14:53 Over the past over the past few years that they've been really investing in

01:14:57 this area, they see as a key growth economic diversification prospect for

01:15:02 the Milky Way of trying to raise foreign currency.

01:15:05 And aside from the oil income, which is really the main way that they raised

01:15:09 currency other than the Saudi real. And so this is this is a key area

01:15:14 they've celebrated. Now in 2023, they had 100 million

01:15:18 tourists. And so they have exceeded the target,

01:15:21 which is originally a goal for 2030. They've got they're seven years early.

01:15:25 They're now expanded the target they want to hit by 2030.

01:15:29 Digging into the detail there, though, only only around 30 million of those are

01:15:34 foreign visitors. There's still some way to go in terms of

01:15:36 attracting foreigners in here. And

01:15:39 this new drive to attract foreign capital into the tourism sector is

01:15:43 really part of recognising that all of the investment so far has really been

01:15:48 driven by the government. After the $800 billion that you

01:15:51 mentioned that they've earmarked to invest in the industry.

01:15:55 So far all of that been coming from the Government and the Government's

01:15:58 obviously got a lot of things we're going to need to pay for over the next

01:16:01 few years that it's trying to find other investors to come in and help.

01:16:06 And we know that it's so critical to the kingdom's vision 2030 that they've

01:16:10 talked so much about. I mean, who are these foreign investors

01:16:13 that that they're looking to tap? I mean, are there, you know, countries

01:16:18 already sort of lining up to be a part of this private capital that the kingdom

01:16:22 needs? Well, this is going to be interesting to

01:16:26 see how this develops, because so far, as I say, most of the investment is

01:16:30 being done by the government, the big hotel chains, all the big brands are all

01:16:35 coming here and running hotels for a large part.

01:16:38 They're coming in and running hotels that have been built for them.

01:16:41 And they're really just coming in as operators.

01:16:45 And often, I mean, some of the hotel chains as well, which are coming in, are

01:16:48 coming in on the back of having investment from the Saudis.

01:16:51 So a lot of it is sort of, you know,

01:16:55 there's not a lot of risk that these chains are coming in.

01:16:58 So I think it's going to be tough to see until you really start to see these

01:17:02 hotels getting filled up. The people that foreign investors are

01:17:07 going to want to come in and take a bit of risk on the occupancy rates that

01:17:11 you're going to see here, Bill, there's still a huge amount to be

01:17:16 done in terms of getting this country ready and and to the standard where it's

01:17:21 going to be able to attract foreign investors and foreign tourists as well.

01:17:27 So in the short term, I think it will be quite tough to see foreign investors

01:17:31 coming in. But if they continue with the sort of

01:17:34 growth rate and hotel occupancy that you've seen around some of these resort

01:17:38 but developing, then it will probably start to look a bit more attractive.

01:17:43 It's a fascinating story and very ambitious.

01:17:46 Bloomberg's Matthew Martin, the reporter there.

01:17:48 Thanks, Matthew, so much, joining us from Riyadh.

01:17:51 Let's take in the region. Qatar Airways says traffic jumped by 31%

01:17:55 in the first two months of the year as the Gulf carrier expanded its network to

01:17:59 new destinations, as well as increasing trips on 15 major routes.

01:18:04 Chief Commercial Officer Terry and Torrey told Bloomberg the airline is

01:18:08 benefiting from resurging travel demand after the pandemic.

01:18:14 I think we will enter a phase where as a strong airline will continue to grow

01:18:19 fast and go well. But where's the gap between the best and

01:18:24 the second tier may increase more than maybe one year ago, where everybody was

01:18:30 benefiting from The bottlenecks in the demand

01:18:34 is a supply story. Where is the jet?

01:18:36 Where is the supply? Where is the demand coming from?

01:18:39 Which routes are strongest right now? Which parts of the plane are working

01:18:43 best for you? We have a chance as a Qatar Airways to

01:18:48 be a kind of a geographically very well positioned

01:18:53 airline between the between Asia Australasia and Europe, between Africa

01:18:58 and Europe and Asia. So we can capture globally almost always

01:19:04 the flows except the transatlantic flows and the transpacific flows, and so is

01:19:09 the geographical, geographical location of the are we we capture a bit of

01:19:14 everything, but we have a very, very strong demand between Europe and Asia

01:19:19 and Malaysia's these days regarding the cabin, because we have also now aligned

01:19:24 to having also a broader segment of customers.

01:19:29 Premium Malaysia, US co-operates, everything coming well, we are not a

01:19:34 pure, pure corporate airline like some of our European peer.

01:19:38 So we were able to fill our aircraft with a very good premium Malaysia demand

01:19:43 between Europe and for instance, Southeast Asia.

01:19:46 But in the corporate space we are doing well thanks to the quality of our

01:19:49 product and the quality of our hub in Doha.

01:19:52 And even if the corporate market is recovering slower and still not industry

01:19:59 wise at the level of pre-COVID categories, you're already 35% above

01:20:04 pre-COVID levels regarding the corporate business.

01:20:07 So all cabin and mainly the European, Asian and Africa flows are giving us a

01:20:15 source of satisfaction. That was Qatar Airways Chief Commercial

01:20:22 Officer Terry Antinori there speaking with our Guy Johnson.

01:20:26 Let's stick again in the region. Dubai's latest IPO sold out in minutes

01:20:30 yesterday with investors rushing to snap up shares in the city's public parking

01:20:35 business. Let's bring in Middle East markets

01:20:37 reporter Fara Al-barnawi who is joining us from Dubai so far.

01:20:41 You always have excitement around a new IPO.

01:20:44 Talk to us about this one and really what happened on Tuesday.

01:20:50 Absolutely, John. I mean, it's no surprise, massive demand

01:20:53 for this listing covered within minutes of the book's opening.

01:20:58 So a lot of excitement for parking as the public parking business is known.

01:21:03 And Dubai Investment Fund is selling a 25% stake in this company with a price

01:21:08 range of 2 to 2.1 dirhams. So they will raise about 430 million

01:21:13 dirhams or up to that much from this listing.

01:21:18 There has been massive demand for Dubai government listings and just not that,

01:21:23 but in Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia, as the markets grow and as the governments

01:21:27 sell down stakes in many of their companies.

01:21:30 And Parkin specifically said that demand for parking will grow by 60% through

01:21:36 2033. So it's really a plan to buy cyclicality

01:21:39 and Dubai's population growth. And that's perhaps what's caused a bit

01:21:44 of the excitement. It's also potentially going to attract

01:21:47 some dividend yield players. So we'll see where that price is and how

01:21:51 that will look like and especially with the opens, because if not everyone gets

01:21:56 the allocation that they want, potentially they might look into the

01:21:58 secondary market. Wow.

01:22:01 It'll be interesting to see how that plays out.

01:22:03 Far We also know you're tracking this story about Starbucks slashing jobs in

01:22:08 the Middle East. What's behind this?

01:22:10 Is it still the Middle East crisis that's sort of fueling what's happening

01:22:14 within the company? Effectively, that's what's happening.

01:22:19 So al-Qaida, which is the license partner for Starbucks for over the past

01:22:25 decade in the Middle East and North Africa, with 1300 locations in the

01:22:29 region, cut 2000 jobs, reducing the workforce in Starbucks by 20%.

01:22:37 That's amidst a tough economic climate, challenging trading conditions, as well

01:22:42 as ongoing boycotts by consumers that are sort of opposing the way Starbucks

01:22:50 has responded to Israel's war in Gaza. So we do know that these jobs have been

01:22:57 eliminated. There have been these ongoing boycotts.

01:22:59 And it's not just al-Qaida or Starbucks that has been

01:23:03 affected by that. We've seen those widespread across even

01:23:06 names like McDonald's, Pizza Hut and KFC.

01:23:09 And one way that materializes through these

01:23:13 job cuts and Starbucks. All right, Middle East equities reporter

01:23:18 for a faraway bar. Thanks so much for the update.

01:23:21 All right. Plenty more still ahead.

01:23:23 This is Bloomberg.

01:23:41 All right. Let's stick in the region here in Africa

01:23:44 and get more on an M&A deal between a French media giant and South Africa's

01:23:48 biggest broadcaster. Vivendi's Canal Plus has boosted its bid

01:23:52 for MultiChoice by almost a fifth as it enters exclusive talks on acquiring

01:23:58 control of the African broadcaster. Let's bring in Bloomberg's Indira Ganga,

01:24:02 who's joining us now from Kigali. So, Indira, why exactly did Vivendi

01:24:06 increase its offer? Talk to us about the backstory here.

01:24:11 Mm hmm. I think they truly understand the value

01:24:13 of MultiChoice and the impact that it will have on on their company once they

01:24:18 acquire them. Since the the bid was made, we've seen

01:24:21 MultiChoice offers rise by 52%. And we've also seen their share prices

01:24:27 rise by 4.7% since Tuesday when the announcement was made.

01:24:31 Speaking on the matter, the CEO of Canal Plus, who's also the chairman, says they

01:24:36 have valuable insights on the value and the real

01:24:41 prices of shares of MultiChoice. And so that's why they increased the

01:24:46 offer that they were making from 105 cents per share to 125, bringing the

01:24:51 company's total valuation to $2.9 billion.

01:24:55 Now, since this announcement was made, Canal will be working with Jp morgan and

01:25:00 also Bank of America to draft a formal offer.

01:25:04 They're also very keen on still listing on the JSE.

01:25:07 On the other hand, MultiChoice is going to form an independent board to consider

01:25:11 these offer and issue recommendations. And know, I mean, I don't think we can

01:25:17 understate how significant MultiChoice really is to the to the continent when

01:25:22 it comes to the significance of Canal Plus now trying to make this deal

01:25:26 happen. Can you just outline really why it's so

01:25:30 important and could be pretty instrumental?

01:25:35 It opens them up to the rest of the continent.

01:25:37 Canal Plus has a subscriber base of 8 million concentrated in Francophone.

01:25:42 On the other hand, MultiChoice brings on board 23 million.

01:25:46 So this buyout opens them up to access to 50 sub-Saharan countries with which

01:25:51 MultiChoice operates in. They're also other advantages because if

01:25:55 we take a look at Showmax, which is the streaming platforms, they have a

01:25:58 commanding lead on streaming on the continent with nearly 40% subscriber

01:26:02 base at 2.1 million subscribers compared to Netflix at 1.8.

01:26:06 And all this did not happen in a vacuum. MultiChoice has invested heavily in

01:26:10 content. They've partnered with Comcast, NBC,

01:26:13 Universal and also Sky to revamp their streaming, introducing new products like

01:26:18 live Premier League matches. And so Vivendi is hoping that by

01:26:22 acquiring MultiChoice, they'll grow their subscriber base to nearly 50

01:26:26 million. A very ambitious target.

01:26:28 But also Canal Plus is hoping that they can become one of the top five global

01:26:32 streaming platforms. Yeah, it ups the ante in terms of

01:26:36 streaming wars on the continent. Bloomberg's Indira Gandhi.

01:26:39 Indira, thanks so much for that update. And let's stick here.

01:26:43 In South Africa, the nation's economy escaped a technical recession in the

01:26:47 fourth quarter, with GDP expanding a 10th of a percent in the final three

01:26:51 months of last year. Southern Africa's biggest economy

01:26:54 benefited from fewer power cuts, which helped a rebound of energy intensive

01:26:59 industries, including mining growth for the full year, came in at a sixth of a

01:27:04 percent, compared with 1.9% in 2020 to the economy's lackluster performance

01:27:10 last year was partly caused by logistical challenges at a state owned

01:27:14 port and rail operator that hit its exports.

01:27:18 All right. Plenty more still ahead.

01:27:21 This is Bloomberg.

01:27:44 Turning now to the UK, where it's budget day.

01:27:47 The chancellor is planning to put personal tax cuts at the top of his

01:27:51 agenda. Jeremy Hunt is attempting to balance

01:27:53 very tight public finances with Conservative Party demands for a

01:27:57 pre-election giveaway. Let's get more with Bloomberg's Lizzie

01:28:01 Borden, who is all over this story and joining us from London.

01:28:03 So, Lizzie, give us the outline. What are we expecting here?

01:28:07 Well, John, there's not likely to be room for many giveaways after the

01:28:10 chancellor has cut one of the main rates of tax.

01:28:13 That's what we're expecting today. It was thought to be income tax.

01:28:17 Now it's thought to be National insurance.

01:28:19 So he started cutting national insurance back in the Autumn Statement.

01:28:23 And it's thought to be preferable to cutting income tax because it would be

01:28:26 less expensive and less inflationary, but it'll still be inflationary to some

01:28:31 degree. How could it not be when you're handing

01:28:33 £10 billion back to consumers, but you've got Conservative MPs complaining

01:28:39 already that an income tax cut would be an easier sell on the doorstep, more

01:28:44 easy to understand politically. On the other hand, who can claim that a

01:28:50 national insurance cut is going to help incentivise people back to work because

01:28:54 it only applies to people in jobs? Our reporter Alex Wickham reckons that

01:28:59 an income tax cut is going to be coming not today but down the line and that

01:29:03 will be a key battle line in the general election because it's a promise that

01:29:08 Rishi Sunak made when he was vying to be Conservative leader.

01:29:13 Hmm. And then, Lizzie, I mean, how worried

01:29:15 then? We're looking at the chancellor right

01:29:17 now. Some video of the chancellor.

01:29:18 I mean, how worried does he need to be, then, about potentially bond vigilantes

01:29:22 coming in here? I think any chancellor in the aftermath

01:29:26 of Liz Truss is worried about the bond vigilantes.

01:29:29 And my nerves haven't recovered from Liz Truss this mini budget and nor have many

01:29:33 British people's mortgages. So they lie as a spectre over any fiscal

01:29:38 event in the UK. But the reality is it's likely that the

01:29:42 markets will be pretty relaxed about this fiscal statement.

01:29:45 As long as Jeremy Hunt does that, does that.

01:29:48 He nods to fiscal prudence as long as he allows the Office for Budget

01:29:53 Responsibility to mark his homework because in the past they have forgiven a

01:29:58 little fudge here and there. A bit of fiscal fiction.

01:30:01 Like, for example, the fact that the temporary fuel duty freeze has been

01:30:06 temporary since 2011. But if you do get a big reaction in the

01:30:11 bond market, you'll know that Jeremy Hunt has done something particularly

01:30:15 egregious. And of course, it would lift the cost of

01:30:17 borrowing for the government. And Lizzie, you're perfectly positioned

01:30:22 to do this interview with Jeremy Hunt later today.

01:30:25 Just considering what you have gone through in what you just outlined there,

01:30:27 I mean, what is what is at the top of your list in terms of what you want to

01:30:31 hear from the chancellor? There are a couple of things, John.

01:30:34 I want to know whether he is being fiscally responsible, because that's the

01:30:38 question for those bond vigilantes. Do his sums really add up?

01:30:43 And is he just doing all of this tax cutting to win voters or is it

01:30:48 economically responsible? Finally, is it economically responsible?

01:30:52 Is it politically responsible? Does he really think that all of these

01:30:56 measures are going to win him? And to the Prime minister, Rishi Sunak.

01:31:01 The election this year. Fascinating.

01:31:05 Can't wait for that conversation. Bloomberg's Lizzie Borden in London for

01:31:08 us. Lizzie, thanks so much for joining us

01:31:10 this morning. All right, look, quick, let's take a

01:31:12 quick check on markets before we let you go, starting with Bitcoin, because we've

01:31:15 been talking about the swings that we've been seeing from Bitcoin now at 65,000,

01:31:20 80, 70. What we mentioned to you yesterday, it

01:31:23 saw an all time high on Tuesday, but then retreated back looking like it's

01:31:27 gaining a bit of steam there. We'll see how much legs an upside there

01:31:33 there has for the cryptocurrency there. Let's take a look at where futures are

01:31:37 as well, because the markets are digesting a lot of news right now.

01:31:41 Of course, there's what's coming out of China.

01:31:43 But also later today, we're waiting to hear from Fed Chair Jerome Powell.

01:31:48 On Tuesday, it was a difficult day for US equities.

01:31:52 S&P futures, though, pointing to the upside potentially for the Wednesday

01:31:55 session. NASDAQ futures also seeing a bit of a

01:31:58 rebound after seeing its biggest drop in weeks on Tesla and both Apple dropping.

01:32:05 Euro Stoxx 50 futures also potentially looking at some upside up about a 10th

01:32:11 of a percent. We'll see whether or not that actually

01:32:14 materializes. And maybe a quick check on brent crude

01:32:17 before we go if we have time. Not sure.

01:32:21 Brent crude, there we go, 8230. A bit of upside for Brent crude there.

01:32:25 All right, stick with us, Bloomberg Daybreak.
