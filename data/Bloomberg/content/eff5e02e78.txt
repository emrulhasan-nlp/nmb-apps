In a fit of pique, stung by their inability to take action on the border crisis, House Republicans have resorted to their usual go-to moves: distraction and retribution. It is a playbook that has been used before in state government, with a far less satisfying result: frustration.

The impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas by a single vote was certainly disgraceful, as Republicans presented no credible evidence of any wrongdoing. They simply don’t like the policies of President Joe Biden and needed to change the subject from their own policy failures — including a previous failed attempt to impeach Mayorkas. The bar should be much higher. As Biden rightly noted shortly after the vote Tuesday night: “History will not look kindly on House Republicans for their blatant act of unconstitutional partisanship.”
