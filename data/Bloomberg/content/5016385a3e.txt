00:13 >> FROM THE WORLD POLITICS TO THE WORLD OF BUSINESS, THIS IS

00:18 "BALANCE OF POWER."

00:28 LIVE FROM WASHINGTON, D.C. KRITI: KAILEY: KAILEY:

00:35 FROM BLOOMBERG -- FROM BLOOMBERG'S WASHINGTON, D.C.

00:39 STUDIOS WORLDWIDE, WELCOME TO "BALANCE OF POWER." JOE:

00:43 NIKKI HALEY ENDS HER CAMPAIGN AFTER DISAPPOINTING SUPER

00:48 TUESDAY SETTING UP DONALD TRUMP

00:55 AND JOE BIDEN DONS THE LONGEST ELECTION IN AMERICAN HISTORY.

00:57 KAILEY: THE HOUSE PASSES A SIX-BILL

01:03 FUNDING PACKAGE TO AVERT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN.

01:08 A REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN FROM MICHIGAN WILL BE WITH US AS

01:17 WELL.

01:20 INTERESTING SIT DOWN WITH THE CHAIRMAN.

01:24 WE WILL GET INTO THIS LATER ON, BUT INTERESTING TO FINALLY GET

01:27 DETAILS ON THESE CLIMATE DISCLOSURES THAT HAVE BEEN SO

01:32 CONTROVERSIAL. KAILEY:

01:34 DEFINITELY POLITICALLY SENSITIVE DECISION.

01:41 THERE ARE THOSE THAT DO NOT THINK THE SEC SHOULD BE WAITING

01:44 INTO THESE WATERS AS WELL. ON THE OTHER HAND, WE HAVE

01:46 CLIMATE ACTIVIST TO SAY THE SEC DID NOT GO FAR ENOUGH.

01:50 THAT ONE OF THE VERY POLITICALLY CHARGED QUESTIONS

01:54 WE ARE DEALING WITH IN WASHINGTON.

01:56 OF COURSE, IT'S A NEW DAY. IT'S POST SUPER TUESDAY, THE

02:00 WEDNESDAY AFTER, SO FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES, THE

02:02 GENERAL ELECTION HAS BEGUN. JOE: WE START WITH THE STATE OF THE

02:07 RACE THIS EVENING AFTER NIKKI HALEY OFFICIALLY SUSPENDED HER

02:08 CAMPAIGN THIS MORNING. HERE SHE IS.

02:15 >> THE TIME HAS NOW COME TO SUSPEND MY CAMPAIGN.

02:16 I SAID I WANTED AMERICANS TO HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD.

02:20 I HAVE DONE THAT. I HAVE NO REGRETS.

02:25 ALTHOUGH I WILL NO LONGER BE A CANDIDATE, I WILL NOT STOP

02:30 USING MY VOICE FOR THE THINGS I BELIEVE IN. JOE:

02:33 THAT'S WHERE WE BEGIN YOUR CONVERSATION WITH BLOOMBERG'S

02:36 MICHAEL SHEPPARD COMING OFF A LATE SUPER TUESDAY.

02:39 I'M NOT SURE YOU HAVE GONE HOME YET.

02:40 THE STATEMENT FROM THE CAMPAIGN LAST EVENING BEFORE SHE DROPPED

02:49 THIS MORNING, THERE WERE A LOT OF

02:52 REPUBLICANS EXPRESSING DEEP CONCERNS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP.

02:57 >> THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO LISTEN TO WHAT SHE SAID TODAY.

03:01 SHE SAID -- AND THIS WAS A MESSAGE TO DONALD TRUMP -- HE

03:05 WILL HAVE TO EARN THEIR SUPPORT. HE WILL HAVE TO WIN THEM OVER,

03:10 AND WE SAW THAT A NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS WHO WERE VOTING IN

03:13 THE PRIMARIES FOR HALEY WERE DOING IT ACTIVELY BECAUSE THEY

03:17 DID NOT WANT HIM TO BE RETURNING TO THE REPUBLICAN

03:20 TICKET OR EVEN MORE SO TO THE WHITE HOUSE. KAILEY:

03:25 EVEN THOSE WHO ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT MIGHT NOT WANT TO SEE

03:27 HIM RETURN FOR A SECOND TERM, THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN CRITICAL OF

03:33 HIM, SEEM TO BE FALLING IN LINE AFTER HAILEY'S DEPARTURE, ONE B

03:36 AND MITCH MCCONNELL, WHO CALLED TRUMP PRACTICALLY IMMORALLY

03:37 RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HAPPENED AT THE CAPITAL -- HAPPY CAPITAL

03:46 -- AT THE CAPITOL BUT TODAY SAID HE IS THE REPUBLICAN

03:49 NOMINEE AND OF COURSE HAS HIS SUPPORT.

03:50 >> WE'VE BEEN WONDERING IF HE WOULD MAKE THE NOMINATION OF

03:52 TRUMP. BTW -- THE TWO MEN HAVE NEVER

03:58 HAD A GREAT RELATIONSHIP, EVEN GOING BACK TO 2015 WHEN TRUMP

04:00 CAME DOWN THE GOLDEN ESCALATOR. I REMEMBER HIM COMING INTO THIS

04:04 OFFICE AND EXPRESSING SOME CHAGRIN DURING A ROUNDTABLE

04:07 WITH EDITORS AND REPORTERS ABOUT TRUMP'S PREDILECTION FOR

04:11 TWEETS AND FOR JUST SELLING A LITTLE BIT OF CHAOS.

04:15 HE WAS JOKING ABOUT IT AT THE TIME, BUT BEHIND THE JOKE WAS A

04:18 MORE SERIOUS CONCERN ABOUT WHERE THE PARTY WAS HEADING

04:19 WITH TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

04:25 THE BREAK BECAME OFFICIAL, AS YOU SAID, AFTER JANUARY 6,

04:29 2021, AND THE TWO MEN HAVE NOT SPOKEN SINCE.

04:33 IT WAS INTERESTING, THE TIMING OF MCCONNELL'S ANNOUNCEMENT.

04:37 20 MINUTES AFTER NIKKI HALEY FINISHED SPEAKING, SO IN A WAY,

04:40 THAT REALLY CLOSE THE BOOK ON ONE PHASE OF THE REPUBLICAN

04:46 PARTY AND OPENED A NEW BOOK, A NEW PHASE OF THE STORY FOR THE

04:47 GOP. KAILEY: ABSOLUTELY.

04:53 THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. WE HAVE TO POINT OUT THAT LAST

04:57 NIGHT'S BINARIES WERE NOT JUST AT THE PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL.

05:00 THEY ALSO SET THE STAGE FOR SEVERAL KEY CONGRESSIONAL RACES.

05:04 WE WANT TO BRING IN EARLIER -- BRING IN OUR TEXAS BUREAU CHIEF.

05:06 TEXAS WAS JUST ONE OF THE RACES WE WERE WATCHING, INCLUDING

05:11 THAT KEY SENATE RACE IN WHICH TED CRUZ WILL FACE A CHALLENGER.

05:17 >> HE WILL FACE A CHALLENGER, CONGRESSMAN: ALL RED.

05:21 TED CRUZ HAS A BIG BASE IN TEXAS, BUT BETO Oâ€™ROURKE DID

05:25 COME WITHIN THREE POINTS IN 2018 AGAINST SENATOR CRUZ.

05:26 DEMOCRATS PINNING THEIR HOPES ON COLIN ALL RED, A FORMER NFL

05:30 STAR. THEN HE WAS AN ATTORNEY. THEN HE WORKED IN THE OBAMA

05:34 ADMINISTRATION. THEY HAVE VERY HIGH HOPES FOR

05:36 HIM, BUT YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE STATE OF TEXAS WHERE IT'S VERY

05:41 DIFFICULT. NO DEMOCRAT HAS WON STATEWIDE

05:44 OFFICE SINCE THE MID-1990'S. BOTH WILL HAVE TO RAISE A LOT

05:46 OF MONEY IN THIS RACE. JOE: INDEED.

05:51 IT COULD BE ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE IN THE COUNTRY.

05:56 THEN AGAIN, WE TURN TO CALIFORNIA.

06:00 WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT ADAM SCHIFF'S PLAN TO ELEVATE A

06:03 REPUBLICAN TO BE HIS CHALLENGER. >> THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE DID.

06:07 HE WANTED STEVE GARVEY TO BE HIS CHALLENGER. NOW HE IS.

06:11 HE'S COUNTING ON DEMOCRATS TO COME HOME.

06:13 THAT'S WHAT HIS PLAN WAS ALL ALONG.

06:15 IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF GARVEY CAN GET SOME TYPE OF

06:17 FOLLOWING IN A VERY BLUE STATE, BUT THAT WAS ADAM SCHIFF'S PLAN.

06:22 HE DID NOT WANT TO FACE ANOTHER DEMOCRAT AND GOT HIS WISH.

06:26 KAILEY: ADAM SCHIFF IS CURRENTLY SITTING IN THE HOUSE OF

06:29 REPRESENTATIVES. I IMAGINE HE WAS ONE OF THE

06:31 DEMOCRATS WHO CAST A VOTE TONIGHT TO PASS A FUNDING

06:35 PACKAGE, SIX BILLS, THIS FIRST WANTS TO AVOID A GOVERNMENT

06:39 SHUTDOWN THAT COULD HAVE BEGUN AFTER THE DEADLINE ON FRIDAY.

06:42 IT OBVIOUSLY WILL NOW GO TO THE SENATE, BUT THEORETICALLY, THE

06:46 HARDER FIGHT, THE OTHER SIX BILLS THAT REQUIRE PASSAGE,

06:47 COULD STILL BE AHEAD.

06:50 >> EXACTLY. THESE ARE THE BILLS THAT WOULD

06:53 BE EASIEST TO PASS. AGAIN, THE CAN HAS BEEN KICKED

06:56 DOWN THE ROAD. ESSENTIALLY, A LOT OF DEMOCRATS

07:00 CAME THROUGH TODAY FOR THE REPUBLICAN SPEAKER.

07:01 NOW HE HAS TO GET THIS DONE MARCH 22.

07:04 THE REPUBLICAN SPEAKER HAS TO KEEP A GROUP OF CONSERVATIVES

07:07 VERY HAPPY. HE HAS TO KEEP SOME MODERATES

07:09 VERY HAPPY. YOU TALK ABOUT AID IN FOREIGN

07:13 COUNTRIES AS WELL. THIS PART WAS THE EASIEST PART,

07:17 AND AGAIN, THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FACE THIS, AND NOBODY

07:21 WANTS A SHUTDOWN IN AN ELECTION YEAR, BUT THEY WILL HAVE TO

07:23 FACE THIS AGAIN IN JUST A FEW WEEKS. JOE:

07:28 APPRECIATE YOU BEING WITH US FROM TEXAS. WE THANK YOU.

07:33 ELSEWHERE, FED CHAIR JAY POWELL TESTIFYING IN THE HOUSE ABOUT

07:35 INFLATION AND THE OUTLOOK FOR RATE CUTS.

07:37 HERE'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY.

07:40 >> WE BELIEVE OUR POLICY RATE IS LIKELY AT ITS PEAK FOR THIS

07:42 CYCLE. WE WANT TO SEE MORE DATA SO WE

07:44 CAN BECOME CONFIDENT AND SO WE CAN TAKE THAT STEP OF BEGINNING

07:49 TO REDUCE POLICY DEBATES. THE COMMITTEE DOES NOT EXPECT

07:51 IT WILL BE APPROPRIATE TO REDUCE THE TARGET RANGE UNTIL

07:55 IT HAS GAINED GREATER CONFIDENCE THAT INFLATION IS

07:57 MOVING SUSTAINABLY TOWARD 2%. WHEN WE REACH THAT CONFIDENCE,

08:00 THE EXPECTATION IS WE WILL DO SO SOMETIME THIS YEAR.

08:06 WE CAN BEGIN DIALING BACK THAT RESTRICTION ON OGRE POLICY.

08:08 IF THE ECONOMY EVOLVES BROADLY AS EXPECTED, IT WILL BE

08:10 APPROPRIATE TO BEGIN DIALING BACK POLICY RESTRAINT AT SOME

08:15 POINT THIS YEAR. JOE COLEY HERE TO HELP US

08:19 UNPACK WHAT WE HEARD FROM WASHINGTON, MICHAEL MCKEE,

08:22 BLOOMBERG ECONOMICS EDITOR WITH US HERE IN WASHINGTON.

08:23 GOOD TO SEE YOU AT THE TABLE. DID WE ACTUALLY LEARN ANYTHING

08:24 NEW TODAY? MICHAEL: NOT IN THAT REGARD.

08:31 MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE MIGHT HAVE BEEN HOPING FOR A NEW SET OF

08:32 HAND-ME-DOWNS. THIS IS ALL STUFF THAT HAS BEEN

08:39 SAID BEFORE. IN TERMS OF MONETARY POLICY,

08:41 THERE WAS NOTHING NEW, BUT I CAN SAY SOMETHING THAT MIKE

08:51 SHEPPARD CANNOT SAY, JAY POWELL BROUGHT CONGRESS TOGETHER TODAY.

08:54 BIPARTISAN COMPLAINTS ABOUT BANKING REGULATION.

08:55 THE BANKING INDUSTRY DOES NOT LIKE WHAT THEY CALL THE BASEL

09:00 THREE ENDGAME RULES THAT WOULD RAISE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR

09:03 BANKS AND IMPOSE ANOTHER LEVEL OF REGULATION ON THEM.

09:07 EVERY DISTRICT HAS A BANKER.

09:15 EVERY BANKER LOBBIES CONGRESSMAN , AND IT WORKED

09:16 BOTH SIDES. REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS WERE

09:20 CRITICAL OF THESE REGULATIONS AND PUSHED POWELL ON THEM.

09:23 POWELL IS NOT A FAN OF THEM EITHER.

09:25 HE WOULD LIKE TO DIAL THEM BACK. HE SAID THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE

09:28 THEY MIGHT EVEN BE SCRAPPED ENTIRELY BUT SAID WE ARE STILL

09:30 A LONG WAY FROM PUTTING REGULATIONS OUT THERE.

09:36 HE THINKS THERE WILL BE MAJOR CHANGES MADE, BUT IT WAS

09:38 INTERESTING TO SEE IT WAS NOT JUST REPUBLICANS WHO HAD

09:42 ANNOUNCED IT WOULD BE GOING AFTER HIM ON THE SUBJECT.

09:44 DEMOCRATS JOINED IN AS WELL. KAILEY:

09:48 DEMOCRATS AND THE OTHER CHAMBER THAT WILL HEAR FROM POWELL

09:51 TOMORROW MAY BE SINGING A DIFFERENT TUNE.

09:56 COULD WE GET ANSWERS TO ANYTHING WE DID NOT GET ANSWERS

09:58 TO TODAY WHEN HE IS BEFORE THE SENATE? MICHAEL: PROBABLY NOT.

10:03 IT'S NOT IN HIS INTEREST TO GIVE ANY KIND OF TIMETABLE AT

10:06 THIS POINT FOR WHEN THE FED MIGHT BE CUTTING RATES.

10:08 THEY HAVE MADE THE CASE THEY ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THE

10:09 DATA. THEY WANT TO SEE FURTHER PROGRESS ON INFLATION, SO

10:17 THERE'S NO BENEFIT TO HIM FOR GIVING ANYBODY ANY KIND OF

10:19 CLUES THAT WOULD SEND THE MARKET SCRAMBLING IN ANY ONE

10:22 DIRECTION OR ANOTHER. PROBABLY GET THE SAME THING ON

10:24 THAT. HE HAS ALREADY SAID, I HAVE

10:28 PROBLEMS WITH THE BANKING BILL. THIS MAY BE ONE OF THOSE

10:30 HEARINGS WHERE THE EXCHANGES BETWEEN ANGRY SENATORS AND THE

10:34 CHAIRMAN WHO IS ALWAYS NICE AND CALM AND COMPOSED, WILL WE GET

10:38 MOSTLY. JOE: JOBS DAY COMING. WE WILL BE TALKING WITH YOU

10:42 ABOUT THAT FRIDAY. WHAT IS JAY POWELL'S NEXT STOP

10:48 ON THE ROAD WHEN IT COMES TO ECONOMIC DATA? MICHAEL:

10:53 THEY WANT TO SEE JOBS NUMBERS GO DOWN.

10:56 WE HAD THE ADP DATA TODAY WHICH WALL STREET GENERALLY IGNORES,

11:00 BUT IT WAS EVEN STRONGER THAN WHAT THE FED WANTS TO SEE.

11:05 WE HAD 353,000 LAST MONTH. WE WILL SEE IF THE FED REVISES

11:08 DOWN AT ALL. THAT STILL TELLS THEM THEY HAVE

11:12 A STRONG ECONOMY, WHICH FEEDS DEMAND, WHICH SLOWS THE PROCESS

11:13 OF BRINGING INFLATION DOWN. WE ALSO GET THE CPI NEXT WEEK.

11:22 IT SEEMS LIKE JUST YESTERDAY WE HAD A CPI REPORT. JOE:

11:25 WE MANAGED TO KEEP THE GOVERNMENT OPEN, SO WE CAN KEEP

11:26 PRODUCING DATA. MICHAEL: THAT'S TRUE. KAILEY:

11:31 I'M SURE WE WILL BE HEARING ABOUT THE ECONOMIC DATA TENDS

11:36 -- IN PRESIDENT BIDEN'S SPEECH TOMORROW EVENING.

11:38 COMING UP, MORE ON NIKKI HALEY'S WITHDRAWAL FROM THE

11:39 PRESIDENTIAL RACE.

11:46 >> NIKKI IS GOING TO WIN. YOU SEE THAT IN POLLS.

11:49 WE NEED PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE. KAILEY:

11:56 THAT'S ONE PERSPECTIVE FROM REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN JIM

11:57 JORDAN. WE SPEAK WITH THE FORMER HEAD

12:00 OF THE NEW HAMPSHIRE REPUBLICAN PARTY COMING UP ON "BALANCE OF

12:04 POWER" ON BLOOMBERG TV AND RADIO.

12:23 >> IT IS NOW UP TO DONALD TRUMP TO EARN THE VOTES OF THOSE IN

12:28 OUR PARTY AND BEYOND IT WHO DID NOT SUPPORT HIM AND I HOPE HE

12:31 DOES THAT. AT ITS BEST, POLITICS IS ABOUT

12:35 BRINGING PEOPLE INTO YOUR CAUSE, NOT TURNING THEM AWAY.

12:37 THIS IS NOW HIS TIME FOR CHOOSING. KRITI:

12:45 THAT --KAILEY: THAT WAS FORMER PRESIDENTIAL

12:47 CANDIDATE NIKKI HALEY BOWING OUT OF THE RACE BUT WITHHOLDING

12:50 ENDORSEMENT OF DONALD TRUMP. LET'S BRING IN STEVE DUPREE,

12:53 FORMER CHAIR OF THE NEW HAMPSHIRE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND

12:56 SUPPORTER OF NIKKI HALEY. GREAT TO HAVE YOU BACK ON

12:59 BLOOMBERG TV AND RADIO. NIKKI HALEY ESSENTIALLY TALKING

13:02 ABOUT THIS NOTION THAT TRUMP NOW NEEDS TO EARN THE SUPPORT

13:05 OF PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR HER. CAN HE DO THAT OR ARE THOSE

13:11 VOTERS LIKELY TO GO ELSEWHERE?

13:18 >> I THINK THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN.

13:21 OBVIOUSLY, THEY RAN A VERY WELL RUN PRIMARY CAMPAIGN.

13:27 THIS WAS A LOT BETTER ORGANIZED THAN 2020 WHEN HE WAS

13:30 ENCUMBERED OR 2016 WHEN HE RAN AS A CELEBRITY.

13:32 THEY RAN A GREAT CAMPAIGN, BUT THAT SLICE OF VOTERS WHO HAVE

13:36 CONCERNS ABOUT DONALD, AS DO I, WILL WATCH HOW THIS NEXT PHASE

13:40 OF THE CAMPAIGN PLAYS OUT. JUST LAST WEEK, FOR EXAMPLE,

13:42 WHEN FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE HIS COMMENT ABOUT PUTIN

13:48 BEING FREE TO DO WHAT HE WANTED WITH COUNTRIES THAT WERE NOT

13:52 MEETING THEIR DEFENSE SPENDING OBLIGATION TO NATO, THAT KIND

13:56 OF RECKLESS COMMENT HAS CONSEQUENCES, AT LEAST TO US

13:59 OLD-FASHIONED REPUBLICANS WHO BELIEVE YOU HAVE TO CONDUCT

14:00 YOURSELF A CERTAIN WAY. THAT WILL BE THE CHALLENGE, TO

14:03 SEE IF DONALD TRUMP CAN BRING THOSE VOTERS WITH THESE KINDS

14:07 OF CONCERNS INTO THE PARTY, MUCH LIKE PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS

14:10 THE CHALLENGE TO BRING SOME OF HIS BASE BACK HOME. JOE:

14:13 WHEN YOU GATHERED PARTY FAITHFUL AT THE SNOWSHOE CLUB

14:18 IN CONCORD, NEW HAMPSHIRE, ON THE PEOPLE OF THE PRIMARY,

14:23 EVERYTHING WAS STILL POSSIBLE. NOW THAT WE ARE HERE, AND I

14:26 KNOW YOU HOLD THIS GROUP CLOSELY IN THE FIRST OF THE

14:30 NATION PRIMARY STATE, IF I CAN STILL CALL IT THAT, IS IT NOW

14:31 TIME FOR A CONVERSATION ABOUT A THIRD-PARTY RUN, THE NO-LABELS

14:35 TAKE IT?

14:41 >> NO, I DON'T HEAR MUCH TALK ABOUT THAT.

14:45 I THINK PEOPLE WHO ARE STRONGLY AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD

14:47 SEE A NO LABELS CANDIDATE AS DRAWING MORE VOTES AWAY FROM

14:51 PRESIDENT BIDEN THAN FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP.

14:52 THE HISTORY OF THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATES SHOWS THEY DON'T

14:55 WORK. THEY DON'T WIN. I THINK THE TWO PARTY SYSTEM IS

14:58 JUST TOO WELL ENTRENCHED. BUT FOR ROSS PEROT, GEORGE

15:02 HERBERT WALKER BUSH WOULD HAVE BEEN PRESIDENT A SECOND TERM

15:06 AND BILL CLINTON WOULD HAVE BEEN A FORMER GOVERNOR OF

15:08 ARKANSAS. I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY

15:10 DISCUSSION OF THAT. I THINK THE PEOPLE WHO ARE FOR

15:15 NIKKI HALEY OR OTHER CANDIDATES WILL SIT BACK AND WATCH THE

15:19 TRIAL ISSUES THAT ARE STILL PENDING IN FRONT OF PRESIDENT

15:22 TRUMP PLAY OUT. THEY WILL WATCH HOW HE CONDUCTS

15:24 HIMSELF. THEY WILL WATCH HOW RESIDENT

15:27 BIDEN DOES AS WELL AND I THINK THAT WILL BE A LATEBREAKING

15:33 GROUP, BUT A LOT OF IT CENTERED AROUND SUBURBAN,

15:35 COLLEGE-EDUCATED WOMEN, AND I THINK IN THE BATTLEGROUND

15:36 STATES, THAT'S GOING TO BE THE REAL BATTLEGROUND.

15:42 KAILEY: I WANT TO RETURN TO THE WAY YOU

15:45 JUST DESCRIBED YOURSELF, I THINK YOU SAID AN OLD-SCHOOL

15:46 REPUBLICAN? THERE'S A LOT OF CONVERSATION

15:49 HAPPENING ABOUT HOW THIS IS KIND OF NOT JUST THE DEATH

15:55 KNELL OF NIKKI HALEY'S 2024 CAMPAIGN, BUT IT MIGHT BE, TOO,

16:00 FOR THE REAGANESQUE REPUBLICAN PARTY IF YOU WILL.

16:04 ESPECIALLY AS WE CONSIDER NIKKI HALEY'S POLITICAL FUTURE.

16:07 DO YOU THINK THERE WILL BE A PLACE FOR HER, EVEN LOOKING

16:10 FORWARD TO 2028, OR IS THE PARTY JUST TWO DIFFERENT?

16:18 >> THE PARTY IS JUST -- THE PARTY IS DIFFERENT.

16:20 I REMEMBER THE DISCUSSIONS WHEN RONALD REAGAN CAME ALONG.

16:23 THESE MOVEMENTS HAVE PHASES. THEY ADDED AND THEY FLOW.

16:26 THE SUCCESS OF DONALD TRUMP IN 2016 IS THAT HE REALIZED BEFORE

16:32 ANY OTHER CANDIDATE AND BETTER THAN ANY OTHER CANDIDATE THAT

16:35 PEOPLE ARE UPSET WITH BOTH PARTIES.

16:38 THEY THINK THERE'S A LOT OF TALK, NOT MUCH ACTION.

16:40 THEY HAVE NO RESPECT FOR CONGRESS, THEY DON'T SEE

16:41 PROBLEMS GETTING SOLVED, AND THEY ARE NOT.

16:44 HE WAS VERY BRILLIANT AND PICKING THAT AS A THEME.

16:48 THESE KINDS OF TIDES FLOW. THEY. FOUR YEARS FROM NOW, IT COULD

16:53 BE A VERY DIFFERENT PARTY. WHO KNOWS?

16:57 I DO THINK THERE IS A FUTURE FOR PEOPLE LIKE NIKKI HALEY

17:03 REGARDLESS OF IF DONALD TRUMP OR JOE BIDEN WINS, IN FOUR

17:05 YEARS, THERE WILL BE AN OPEN RACE ON BOTH SIDES, WHICH

17:08 LIKELY MEANS A DOZEN CANDIDATES ON EACH SIDE AND EACH NEW

17:15 CYCLE, THE PARTY REDEFINES ITSELF. JOE:

17:17 GOVERNOR SUNUNU PASSIONATELY MADE THE CASE FOR NIKKI HALEY.

17:21 HE HELPED DELIVER NEW HAMPSHIRE TO JOE BIDEN?

17:26 >> KEEP IN MIND JOE BIDEN ONE NEW HAMPSHIRE BEFORE AND OUR

17:31 ENTIRE DELEGATION IS DEMOCRATIC. WE TRULY HAVE BECOME A PURPLE

17:33 STATE. I DON'T THINK CHRIS SUNUNU

17:38 DELIVERED THE STATE FOR JOE BIDEN BECAUSE CHRIS SAID VERY

17:40 CLEARLY HE WOULD SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP IF YOU WERE THE NOMINEE,

17:44 BUT I THINK IT WILL BE A VERY TOUGH RACE FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP

17:48 HERE BECAUSE IT'S A VERY PURPLE STATE AND CHRIS WAS A GOVERNOR

17:53 WHO FIT THE TIME AND THE ELECTORATE. KAILEY:

17:55 WOULD YOU VOTE FOR BIDEN IN THE ABSENCE OF NIKKI HALEY, IF IT'S

17:59 JUST THOSE TWO CHOICES?

18:04 >> I HAVE NOT MADE UP MY MIND, BUT WHAT'S PARAMOUNT IN MY MIND

18:09 IS I WANT A PRESIDENT WHO I'M PROUD OF, REGARDLESS OF PARTY.

18:13 THAT THEY CONDUCT THEMSELVES WITH THE SERIOUSNESS AND

18:15 STATURE AND GRAVITY IN THE WORLD AND TO OUR CITIZENS OF

18:19 THE UNITED STATES WITH THE KIND OF DECORUM AND RESPECT FOR THE

18:23 OFFICE THAT HAS BEEN THE HALLMARK OF EVERY PRESIDENT

18:28 SINCE THE HISTORY OF OUR REPUBLIC, THAT IS EMBRACING,

18:30 THAT BRINGS US TOGETHER, NOT DIVIDES US, AND I THINK DONALD

18:33 TRUMP HAS A CHANCE TO WIN THOSE FOLKS.

18:36 I'M GOING TO WATCH HOW THAT PLAYS OUT, LIKE I THINK LOTS OF

18:41 VOTERS ARE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. JOE:

18:44 INTERESTING THE WAY YOU CHOSE TO ANSWER THAT.

18:45 TO WHAT EXTENT WILL THE STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS TOMORROW

18:47 FACTOR INTO THAT DECISION?

18:51 >> I THINK EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS BETWEEN NOW AND THE

18:53 ELECTION, THE STATUS OF THE CRIMINAL TRIALS AGAINST FORMER

18:59 PRESIDENT TRUMP, HOW PRESIDENT BIDEN EITHER TRAVELS WITH OR

19:02 SOLVE THE IMMIGRATION PROBLEM -- YOU ARE NOT THINK YOU NEW

19:05 HAMPSHIRE PEOPLE WOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT IMMIGRATION.

19:08 THE ECONOMY IS REALLY THE ISSUE, BUT PEOPLE IN BOTH

19:13 PARTIES ARE UPSET ABOUT IMMIGRATION.

19:15 I THINK IF PRESIDENT BIDEN DOES NOT TAKE SOME VERY DEFINITIVE

19:18 STEPS, THAT ISSUE ALONE COULD TURN THIS ELECTION. JOE:

19:20 STEVE DUPREE, WE THANK YOU FOR

19:26 BEING WITH US THIS DAY AFTER SUPER TUESDAY.

19:27 FASCINATING INSIGHTS. COMING UP, WE TURN TO THE

19:29 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, OUT TODAY WITH NEW

19:32 CLIMATE RULES. WE SPOKE WITH THE CHAIR OF THE

19:37 SEC. WE WILL HAVE SOME HIGHLIGHTS FROM THAT

19:38 CONVERSATION NEXT. THIS IS "BALANCE OF POWER"

19:41 ON BLOOMBERG TV AND RADIO. â™ª

20:07 JOB: THIS IS "BALANCE OF POWER" ON BLOOMBERG TV AND RADIO.

20:11 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WILL FORCE COMPANIES

20:14 TO DISCLOSE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FOR THE FIRST TIME,

20:19 BUT WATERED DOWN, A KEY REQUIREMENT AFTER HEAVY

20:22 LOBBYING FROM INDUSTRY GROUPS. FCC CHAIRMAN GARY GENSLER SET

20:26 DOWN TO DISCUSS WITH US EARLIER TODAY HERE ON BLOOMBERG.

20:31 >> OF YOUR HISTORY, OH YOUR REMIT IS ABOUT THAT WHICH IS

20:33 MATERIAL FOR INVESTORS, AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING HERE.

20:41 WE ARE CLIMATE RISK AGNOSTIC, AND IF MORE COMPANIES MAKE THIS

20:48 DISCLOSURE OR FEWER MAKE THE DISCLOSURE, IT'S ABOUT

20:51 MATERIALITY, BUT I WOULD SAY WHAT WE DID TODAY IS IMPORTANT

20:54 BECAUSE IT WOULD BRING SOME CONSISTENCY IF IT IS A REAL

20:57 RULE. JOE: OBVIOUSLY, LEGAL CHALLENGES ARE

20:59 ALREADY BEING PLANNED. THERE ARE NINE STATES, LED BY

21:03 WEST VIRGINIA, THAT WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT. IS IT GOVERNMENTS?

21:07 IS IT CORPORATIONS? IS IT ENVIRONMENTALISTS WHO

21:12 WILL BRING THE LEGAL CHALLENGES OR IS IT ALL OF THEM?

21:17 >> AT THE SEC, WE ENDEAVOR TO DO THINGS WITHIN THE LAW AND

21:22 HOW THE CORPORATE -- HOW THE COURTS INTERPRET THE LAW.

21:26 WE TAKE THESE 24,000 COMMENTS INTO CONSIDERATION AND OF

21:32 COURSE, WE TAKE IN ANOTHER LAW THAT I WILL CALL THE

21:33 ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT, HOW WE DO RULE WRITING.

21:38 I FEEL QUITE CONFIDENT THAT WE HAVE DONE SOMETHING WITHIN THE

21:43 CONGRESSIONAL MANDATE, AND WHY IS THAT? IT'S BECAUSE WE ARE A

21:46 DISCLOSURE AGENCY. THAT'S ALL WE ARE DOING HERE.

21:53 1000-PLUS COMPANIES ARE ALREADY PUTTING OUT SOME CLIMATE RISK

21:57 INFORMATION. INVESTORS ARE ALREADY MAKING

22:00 DECISIONS. WE ARE SAYING GROUND IT IN

22:03 MATERIALITY. PUT IT IN YOUR FINDINGS AND BE

22:08 CONSISTENT WITH WHAT YOU ARE DOING. KAILEY:

22:13 THAT WAS SEC CHAIR GARY GENSLER SPEAKING WITH US EARLIER ON

22:14 BLOOMBERG. YOU WERE ALLUDING TO LAWSUITS.

22:19 HE AND THE SEC COULD BE DEALING WITH IT FROM BOTH ENDS, FROM

22:24 ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISTS AND FROM THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY.

22:26 IT COULD BE NO ONE IS SATISFIED. JOE:

22:30 NOT TO MENTION THESE ATTORNEYS GENERAL WHO COULD GET A LOT OF

22:35 FREE PRESS OUT OF THIS.

22:37 KAILEY: WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT

22:41 STORY COVERED FOR YOU HERE ON BLOOMBERG TV AND RADIO.

22:44 COMING UP, WE WILL BE JOINED BY THE FOUNDER AND CEO OF MISSING

22:48 A GROUP ON A WEDNESDAY IN WHICH THE GENERAL ELECTION HAS

22:50 EFFECTIVELY BEGUN AND ALSO

23:13 >> SO FAR IN THESE PRIMARIES, THE REPUBLICAN TOURNAMENT --

23:16 THE REPUBLICAN TURNOUT IS DOUBLE THAT OF THE DEMOCRATS.

23:19 I WOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT IF I WERE THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN

23:23 BECAUSE THAT'S A VERY GOOD MEASURE OF ENTHUSIASM, WHICH

23:26 THEY WILL NEED TO BOOST TO PREPARE HIM FOR THE GENERAL

23:27 ELECTION. JOE: THAT WAS JIM ELLIS, FOUNDER OF

23:32 THE NEWSLETTER ELLIS INSIGHT WITH US YESTERDAY.

23:34 JOINING US NOW AS WE EXPLORE THE LAY OF THE LAND ON THE

23:41 CAMPAIGN TRAIL, JIM MESSINA, FORMER OBAMA CAMPAIGN MANAGER,

23:44 FOUNDER AND CEO OF THE MESSINA GROUP. IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU.

23:48 WELCOME BACK. YOU CAN TALK ABOUT PASSION.

23:51 YOU CAN TALK ABOUT ORGANIZING OR MESSAGE MAY BE THIS DAY

23:54 BEFORE THE STATE OF THE UNION. WHAT'S THE FIRST JOB RIGHT NOW

23:58 FOR JOE BIDEN NOW THAT THE DIE APPEARS TO BE CAST?

24:06 >> HE'S GOT TO DO TWO THINGS, THE FIRST IS LAY OUT A CLEAR

24:07 PICTURE OF WHERE HE WILL TAKE THE COUNTRY.

24:11 IN THE GENERAL ELECTION, THE INCUMBENT GETS TWO FREE DAYS,

24:15 THE STATE AND THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION SPEECH.

24:17 THIS IS ONE OF HIS TWO FREEBIES AND HE GETS TO LOOK AT THE

24:20 COUNTRY AND SAY THIS IS WHERE I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU.

24:23 THAT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. THE SECOND THING THEY'VE GOT TO

24:27 DO IS DRAW THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THEM AND

24:31 DONALD TRUMP AND REPUBLICANS AND BE VERY CLEAR.

24:34 I USED TO SAY TO PRESIDENT OBAMA, IF IT'S A REFERENDUM ON

24:37 USE, WE WILL LOSE. IF IT'S A CHOICE BETWEEN YOU

24:41 AND YOUR OPPONENT, WE WILL WIN, SO THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN HAS GOT

24:44 TO START DRAWING THAT CONTRAST, AND THE BEST WAY TO DO IT IS

24:46 STATE OF THE UNION. KAILEY:

24:53 WITH THE STATE OF THE UNION, I WONDER WHICH VOTERS HE NEEDS TO

24:55 DIRECTLY SPEAK TO. THIS MORNING STARTED WITH NIKKI

24:59 HALEY DROPPING OUT OF THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY RACE, AND

25:02 BIDEN IN VERY SHORT ORDER RELEASED A STATEMENT, AND I

25:05 WILL READ IT TO YOU IN PART. HE SAYS, "NIKKI HALEY WAS

25:07 WILLING TO SPEAK THE TRUTH ABOUT TRUMP.

25:11 DONALD TRUMP MADE IT CLEAR HE DOES NOT WANT NIKKI HALEY

25:12 SUPPORTERS. I WANT TO BE CLEAR -- IT IS A

25:18 PLACE FOR THEM IN MY CAMPAIGN." HOW CAN HE TRY TO DRAW IN MORE

25:22 CONSERVATIVE NIKKI HALEY VOTERS WHILE NOT LOSING THE LEFT FLANK?

25:27 CAN HE HAVE BOTH?

25:29 >> I THINK HE HAS TO. THERE IS A SILLY ARGUMENT IN MY

25:35 PARTY, DO YOU TURN OUT THE VOTE OR DO THE INFLATABLE'S?

25:43 MY ANSWER IS YOU CAN DO BOTH. YOU CAN WALK AND CHEW GUM AT

25:45 THE SAME TIME. THEY ARE UNITED BY WAY MORE

25:51 THAN THEY ARE DIVIDED, THESE DEMOCRATS AND NIKKI HALEY

25:52 VOTERS, SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT HE DO BOTH.

25:57 IT REALLY IS THE CONTRAST IN THE TWO CAMPAIGNS.

25:59 TRUMP AGAIN RECENTLY SAID HE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT THESE

26:02 REPUBLICANS IN NAME ONLY. IF THEY WANT TO LEAVE, THEY CAN

26:07 LEAVE, WHEREAS THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN NEEDS EVERY VOTE THEY

26:10 CAN GET. IT'S JUST TWO VERY DIFFERENT

26:14 APPROACHES FROM THE TWO PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES. JOE:

26:16 THERE'S A CONVERSATION GOING ON RIGHT NOW THAT I'M SURE YOU ARE

26:21 WELL AWARE OF ABOUT WEAKNESS JOE BIDEN HAS FACED IN THE FORM

26:24 OF A PROTEST VOTER.

26:32 MICHIGAN WAS A BIG PART OF THAT, WITH THIS CENTERING

26:34 AROUND HIS POLICIES IN ISRAEL. UNCOMMITTED GOT 19%.

26:37 IN NORTH CAROLINA, NO PREFERENCE RECEIVED 13%.

26:41 WE COULD GO DOWN THE LINE AS OUR VIEWERS CAN SEE.

26:46 HOW REAL OF AN ISSUE WILL THIS BE IN A GENERAL ELECTION, OR IS

26:50 THIS JUST AN EXCISING OF THE DEMONS DURING THE PRIMARY CYCLE?

26:54 >> IT'S BOTH. ON ONE HAND, THOSE ARE ABOUT

26:58 THE PERCENTAGES THAT BARACK OBAMA GOT DESPITE HIS AMAZING

27:03 CAMPAIGN MANAGER. WE STILL GOT ALL THESE STATES

27:05 AND WE HAD ALL THESE PEOPLE THAT WERE UNCOMMITTED AND

27:09 EVERYONE WORRIED ABOUT, INCLUDING US.

27:12 ON THE OTHER HAND, WHEN YOU BARELY WON THE ELECTION AND THE

27:15 CLOSEST STATES LIKE HE DID LAST TIME, YOU CANNOT ASSUME ANY

27:18 VOTE IS SAFE AND YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT EVERY SINGLE VOTE.

27:23 PART OF YOUR JOB AS A CAMPAIGN MANAGER IS TO WORRY EVERY

27:24 SINGLE DAY. THEY ARE GOING TO WORRY ABOUT

27:31 THOSE PEOPLE, TARGET THOSE PEOPLE, AND HAVE CONVERSATIONS

27:32 BECAUSE THEY CAN LEAVE NO VOTE LEFT BEHIND.

27:39 KAILEY: AS A CAMPAIGN MANAGER, I WONDER

27:42 HOW WORRIED HE WOULD BE ABOUT THAT YOU CANNOT CONTROL, WHICH

27:45 IS THE SIMPLE AGE OF THIS PRESIDENT AT 81.

27:47 THIS IS SOMETHING THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY WAS ASKED

27:51 ABOUT TODAY, AND SHE SAID THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR

27:54 AND VERY HONEST ABOUT HIS AGE. HE MAKES JOKES ABOUT IT, BUT AS

27:56 WE LOOK AHEAD TO HEARING FROM HIM TOMORROW NIGHT IN THE STATE

28:00 OF THE UNION, IS IT SO MUCH ABOUT POLICY THAT WILL BE

28:03 CONVINCING TO VOTERS OR IS IT ABOUT PRESENTATION?

28:07 >> IT IS A LOT ABOUT PRESENTATION, YOU ARE TOTALLY

28:10 RIGHT. DEMOCRATS NEED TO ADMIT THAT

28:12 THIS IS AN ISSUE IN THE ELECTION.

28:15 IT DRIVES US CRAZY BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP IS ONLY ABOUT

28:17 THREE YEARS YOUNGER. THEY BOTH COULD HAVE BEEN IN

28:19 HIGH SCHOOL AT THE SAME TIME TOGETHER, BUT VOTERS HAVE

28:23 QUESTIONS ABOUT IT, AND THE BEST WAY TO ADDRESS THOSE

28:26 QUESTIONS IS BY SEEING HIM OUT THERE, HEARING HIM, SEEING HIM

28:27 DO HIS JOB. THAT'S WHY, AS I SAID EARLIER,

28:31 THIS IS ONE OF THE ONLY THINGS HE WILL HAVE WITH THE WHOLE

28:35 COUNTRY WATCHING TO GO STRAIGHT AT IT AND CONVINCE THOSE PEOPLE

28:40 HE IS UP TO THE JOB. THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY

28:42 TOMORROW NIGHT IS SO HIGH-STAKES. JOE:

28:46 TOMORROW NIGHT IS HIGH-STAKES. WHEN WE THINK TO LAST YEAR'S

28:50 STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS, IT WAS THE SPONTANEITY THAT WORKED

28:53 FOR JOE BIDEN, THE STUFF YOU CANNOT PLAN.

28:56 HOW IS STAFF DEALING WITH THAT? HOW IS HE PREPARING FOR THAT

29:00 UNPREDICTABLE MOMENT WHEN YOU CAN TURN A ROOM TO THE EXTENT

29:05 THAT HE DID LAST YEAR? THAT'S WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO,

29:06 RIGHT?

29:10 >> THE STAFF IS DEALING WITH IT BY DRINKING HEAVILY, JOE.

29:11 [LAUGHTER]

29:20 >> THOSE ARE THE THINGS YOU CANNOT SCRIPT.

29:24 THEY ALREADY KNOW WHICH LINES THEY WANT TO BE VIRAL THE NEXT

29:26 DAY, BUT THEY ALSO KNOW THERE WILL BE THOSE ONE HOUR -- ONE

29:32 OR TWO MOMENTS. THEY KNOW MOST PEOPLE WILL NOT

29:33 WATCH THE SPEECH. THEY WILL SEE AT THE NEXT DAY

29:36 ON SOCIAL MEDIA. THEY WILL REALLY WORRY ABOUT

29:39 THOSE COUPLE MOMENTS. THE ONE MOMENT WE ALL REMEMBER

29:44 FROM LAST YEAR'S SPEECH WAS HIM AD-LIBBING AND SAYING TO THE

29:48 REPUBLICANS, I GUESS WE ALL AGREE, YOU DON'T WANT TO TOUCH

29:49 SOCIAL SECURITY. THAT WAS A BIG MOMENT, AND TO

29:54 THE EARLIER QUESTION, IT SHOWED HE WAS WITH IT AND ON TOP OF

29:56 HIS GAME. YOU CANNOT SCRIPT THAT WAS.

29:58 YOU KNOW IT WILL COME, AND YOU JUST HOPE THEY ARE GOOD AND NOT

30:01 BAD. KAILEY:

30:08 AS WE THINK ABOUT THE VISION WE WILL SEE TOMORROW NIGHT OF THE

30:09 PRESIDENT AT THE LECTERN ADDRESSING THIS JOINT SESSION,

30:11 THE NEW SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON WILL BE BEHIND ONE SHOULDER.

30:16 VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS WILL BE BEHIND THE OTHER.

30:18 AS WE TALK ABOUT THIS VERY LONG GENERAL ELECTION CONTEST AND

30:21 WHAT BIDEN NEEDS TO DO, THERE'S TWO PEOPLE ON THIS TICKET, AND

30:26 ONE OF NIKKI HALEY'S BIG MESSAGES THROUGH THE DURATION

30:30 OF HER CAMPAIGN WAS ESSENTIALLY THAT WHAT EVERYONE SHOULD BE

30:33 AFRAID OF IS A PRESIDENT HARRIS. THIS COMES BACK TO THE AGE

30:36 QUESTION, BUT HOW SHOULD THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN BE THINKING

30:37 ABOUT USING HER?

30:41 >> A COUPLE THINGS. FIRST OF ALL, THEY WILL USE HER

30:44 IN PLACES WHERE SHE IS EFFECTIVE AND HELPFUL.

30:46 RIGHT NOW, SHE IS ON A NATIONAL COLLEGE TOUR TALKING TO YOUNG

30:51 VOTERS ABOUT ABORTION, AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHERE I WOULD PUT

30:55 HER AND I THINK THAT IS SUPER SMART.

30:57 SECOND, THEY SHOULD NOT GET DRAWN INTO THIS CONVERSATION

30:59 ABOUT IF SHE HELPS OR HURTS THE TICKET.

31:00 I WENT BACK AND LOOKED AT THE RESEARCH WHEN WE PICKED BIDEN

31:04 OVER TIM KAINE IN 2008 AND AGAIN IN 2012 WHEN MITT ROMNEY

31:06 PICKED PAUL RYAN. THE TRUTH IS THAT A VICE

31:11 PRESIDENT MATTERS LESS THAN 1% TO THE NATIONAL TICKET.

31:14 YOU COULD ARGUE THIS TIME IT COULD BE MORE BECAUSE WE NEVER

31:16 HAD A CANDIDATE THIS OLD. PEOPLE HAD SIMILAR ARGUMENTS

31:18 ABOUT REAGAN. THAT'S JUST NOT THE WAY VOTERS

31:20 THINK ABOUT IT. WHEN YOU SEE THEM AND SEE THEM

31:26 TALK TO REPORTERS AND POSTERS, THEY JUST LOOK AT WHICH OF

31:27 THESE PEOPLE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT WILL HAVE THEIR

31:32 FAMILY'S BEST INTEREST AT HEART. THAT'S THE WAY THEY REALLY VIEW

31:34 IT. THE VICE PRESIDENT JUST DOES NOT MATTER AS MUCH, AND THAT

31:38 INCLUDES FAMOUS VICE PRESIDENTIAL PICKS LIKE LBJ OR

31:42 EVEN SENATOR PALIN. JOE: SUCH A FUN GAME TO PLAY.

31:48 KAILEY: IT IS. GLAD TO MUSSINA WAS WITH US TO

31:50 KEEP PLAYING IT.

31:56 MESSINA GROUP FOUNDER AND CEO, WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.

32:00 COMING UP, THE 460 BILLION DOLLARS SPENDING BILL IS PASSED

32:04 IN THE HOUSE, ON THE WAY TO THE SENATE, ALL IN AN EFFORT TO TRY

32:08 TO AVERT A PARTIAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN, DEADLINE ON FRIDAY.

32:10 IS THIS A SIGNAL THAT THE CHAOS IS OVER?

32:13 WE WILL PUT THAT QUESTION TO OUR POLITICAL PANEL NEXT.

32:17 THIS IS "BALANCE OF POWER" ON BLOOMBERG TV AND RADIO.

32:35 QUICK'S WE ARE SORT OF MEETING EXTREMELY LOW EXPECTATIONS.

32:39 IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE THE GOVERNMENT WILL SHUT DOWN.

32:43 I'M GLAD THAT THE SPEAKER SORT OF CAVED TO THE REALITY OF A

32:51 VERY NARROW MAJORITY, AND A SHUTDOWN WOULD BE A BAD THING.

32:54 I'M HOPING THIS WEEK WE WILL GET A BUNCH OF BILLS DONE AND

32:58 NEXT WEEK, WE CAN MOVE ON TO OTHER ISSUES LIKE UKRAINE.

33:03 KAILEY: THAT WAS DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN

33:06 JIM HIMES OF CONNECTICUT TODAY AND JUST ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

33:11 THE HOUSE DID INDEED PASS A SIX-BILL MEGABUS, IF YOU WILL,

33:14 TO AVERT A SHUTDOWN I COULD HAVE HAPPENED AT THE INDY OF

33:17 THE WEEK. THAT GOES NOW TO THE SENATE.

33:18 THE FOUNDER OF THE WOMEN

33:24 LEADERS SERIES. SO SOMETHING PASSED, AND IT'S

33:28 ACTUALLY NOT A CONTINUING RESOLUTION.

33:30 THIS IS ACTUAL APPROPRIATIONS. THIS GOES THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30,

33:35 JUST DOES THE NICK OF TIME BEFORE PRESIDENT BIDEN GIVES

33:40 HIS BUDGET FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR.

33:43 THIS WAS KIND OF THE EASY STEP, IF YOU WILL.

33:46 WE HAVE SIX MORE BILLS TO PASS BY THE 22ND.

33:47 HOW MUCH HARDER WILL THAT BE?

33:51 >> IT'S GOING TO BE HARDER, BUT I THINK THAT'S A GOOD SIGN.

33:55 CONGRESS HAS GOTTEN IN THIS BAD HABIT, REGARDLESS OF WHO IS IN

33:57 THE MAJORITY OF WAITING UNTIL THE LAST POSSIBLE MINUTE TO DO

33:59 THINGS. COULD COMPARE THEM TO THE

34:01 TEENAGERS AT MY HOUSE. THE GOOD NEWS IS I GOT

34:05 SOMETHING DONE AND DID IT, FRANKLY, WORKING TOGETHER.

34:10 I WOULD SAY HAVE NO PROBLEM IN A DEMOCRACY THAT'S RUN LIKE

34:15 OURS WHERE YOU GET VOTES TO PASS APPROPRIATIONS.

34:16 I DON'T WANT TO OVERLOOK THE MESSAGE THAT SOME OF THE

34:19 CONSERVATIVE NO VOTES HAD, THOUGH, WHICH IS WE HAVE A

34:22 SPENDING PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY AND HAVE TO STOP

34:24 BORROWING AGAINST OUR FUTURE. JOE:

34:30 SHOULD THE SPEAKER COME OUT AND SAY, HEY, WHAT HAS EVERYBODY

34:33 BEEN TALKING ABOUT? I'M LEAVING A BIPARTISAN EFFORT

34:35 HERE. WHEN THE GOVERNMENT.

34:39 >> I THINK HE IS SHOWING THAT HE'S DOING IT, DOESN'T

34:40 NECESSARILY NEED TO SAY IT. JOE: THERE IT IS. KAILEY:

34:46 TO THE POINT ABOUT THIS BEING LONGER-TERM FISCAL TRAJECTORY,

34:49 KNOWING AS WELL THIS IS COMING ON THE EVE OF THE STATE OF THE

34:53 UNION, DOES THE PASSAGE OF THIS TAKE A SOUNDBITE AWAY FROM

34:55 PRESIDENT BIDEN ABOUT THE HOUSE NOT BEING WILLING TO DO

34:56 ANYTHING? I JUST WONDER, THIS TIMING IS

35:00 NOT COINCIDENTAL, RIGHT?

35:02 >> RIGHT. I THINK BIDEN ACTUALLY CARES

35:08 ABOUT WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY, SO HE WOULD BE HAPPY

35:11 TO GIVE UP THE SOUNDBITE IF IT MEANS THESE SPENDING BILLS GET

35:13 PASSED, BUT I THINK IT IS STILL A LITTLE TOO SOON TO SAY THAT

35:17 THE HOUSE HAS WORKED OUT ITS KINKS.

35:19 THERE'S STILL A LOT OF ROOM LEFT FOR CHAOS.

35:21 THE THING IS THAT BIDEN WILL HAVE AN ARGUMENT TO MAKE THAT

35:22 HE HAS BEEN A STEADY HAND ON THE WHEEL.

35:28 HE IS A VOICE FOR COMMON SENSE AND RATIONALISM AND THAT THE

35:32 HOUSE STILL HAS TO DELIVER SIX MORE SPENDING BILLS TO AVOID A

35:38 SHUTDOWN. JOE:

35:39 THE SENATE VOTE COMES TODAY. DOES THAT END UP BECOMING A

35:41 PROBLEM FOR MIKE JOHNSON?

35:48 >> ONLY IF HE LETS IT. I THINK IT SHOWS THAT IF HE IS

35:52 WILLING TO WORK WITH DEMOCRATS, DEMOCRATS ARE MORE LIKELY TO

35:53 HELP HIM STAY IN HIS SEAT. BUT IT ALSO SHOWS THAT HE

35:57 DOESN'T HAVE A HUGE MARGIN OF ERROR WITH HIS CAUCUS, SO HE IS

36:01 REALLY WALKING A VERY FINE LINE. KAILEY:

36:06 IS THIS A LESSON CONSIDERING WE HAVE NOT HAD ANYONE FILING A

36:09 MOTION TO VACATE YET FOR ANYONE -- OR ANYONE REALLY CALLING FOR

36:13 THAT?

36:19 A LOT OF CONSERVATIVES WERE CALLING FOR A SHUTDOWN IN ORDER

36:21 FOR CONSERVATIVES TO GET THE POLICY WRITERS THEY WANTED,

36:23 THAT HE COULD DROWN THAT OUT AS NOISE AND PROCEED TO GOVERN AS

36:26 HE SEES FIT?

36:30 >> HE PASSED THIS WITH A MAJORITY OF REPUBLICANS IN HIS

36:31 CONFERENCE. WE CANNOT OVERLOOK THAT.

36:37 I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A BALANCE.

36:39 HE IS THE LEADER OF THE PARTY IN THE HOUSE, AND HE NEEDS TO

36:43 LISTEN TO THE MEMBERS, BUT IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT EVERYBODY

36:45 HAS TO GO ALONG WITH IT IN ORDER FOR US TO DO THE BUSINESS

36:46 OF THE PEOPLE. JOE:

36:52 I REMEMBER THIS TIME LAST YEAR KEVIN MCCARTHY CALLING FOR

36:54 DECORUM IN THE CHAMBER. DID NOT WORK OUT REALLY THAT

36:56 WAY. HE WAS ACTUALLY SHUSHING PEOPLE

37:02 AT ONE POINT WHEN FOLKS WERE SHOUTING AT THE PRESIDENT.

37:05 WILL THIS BE A FREE-FOR-ALL, OR CAN MIKE JOHNSON KEEP THE

37:06 CONFERENCE UNDER CONTROL?

37:11 >> ON MUCH MORE INTERESTED ABOUT WHAT PRESIDENT BIDEN WILL

37:12 SAY. LET'S START WITH WHAT WILL HE

37:16 SAY IF HE IS SAYING SOMETHING THAT IS MEANINGFUL TO THE

37:17 AMERICAN PEOPLE? I THINK HE'S MUCH LESS LIKELY

37:22 TO POTENTIALLY GET HECKLED. I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE

37:26 LOOKING FOR HIS MESSAGE ON IMMIGRATION AND LOOKING TO SEE

37:32 IF HIS AGE REALLY DOES MATTER. MOST OF THE OTHER RAMBLINGS ON

37:37 IN THE STATE OF THE UNION DON'T REALLY MATTER TO REGULAR VOTERS.

37:39 WE WILL SEE HOW THE CONFERENCE REACTS, AND I THINK PART OF IT

37:41 WILL BE BASED ON HOW HE PRESENTS HIMSELF AND PRESENTS

37:42 HIS MESSAGE. KAILEY: HESITATION OR POLICY, WHICH

37:48 DOES HE NEED TO DELIVER MOST TOMORROW NIGHT?

37:51 >> PRESENTATION. THE STATE OF THE UNION IS

37:54 USUALLY A LAUNDRY LIST OF GOALS. HE'S GOT TO BE VIGOROUS.

37:59 HE'S GOT TO BE STRONG. HE'S GOT TO BE CLEAR IN WHAT HE

38:01 WANTS TO ACHIEVE OVER THE NEXT

38:08 YEAR, OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS, BUT THE POLICY IS TAKEN CARE OF

38:12 AT THIS POINT, AND RIGHT NOW, IT'S REALLY WHERE YOU SHIFT IN

38:16 PRESENTATION AND SHOW THAT HE DESERVES ANOTHER TERM. JOE:

38:22 ALEXEI NAVALNY'S WIDOW AND THE

38:28 FIRST LADY OF UKRAINE DECLINED A SEAT.

38:33 >> THE WHITE HOUSE USES THOSE SEATS AS PROOF POINTS FOR HOW

38:35 POLITICS AFFECT REAL PEOPLE. THE REALITY OF THE SITUATION IS

38:39 BIDEN STILL HAS A STRONG ARGUMENT TO MAKE ABOUT

38:41 DEMOCRACY, FREEDOM, THE THREAT POSED BY RUSSIA WITH OR WITHOUT

38:47 THEM THEY ARE, AND, FRANKLY, IT IS A NICE THING TO HAVE, BUT IT

38:51 DOES NOT CHANGE HIS MESSAGE IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY. JOE:

38:56 COMING UP REACTION TO NIKKI HALEY'S DEPARTURE FROM THE RACE

39:00 TODAY AND THE START OF THE LONGEST GENERAL ELECTION IN

39:01 RECENT HISTORY. THIS IS "BALANCE OF POWER"

39:04 ON BLOOMBERG TV AND RADIO.

39:25 >> MANY OF THEM ARE CONTEMPLATING THIRD-PARTY.

39:26 WHEN YOU PUSH THEM RIGHT NOW, THEY GO FOR JOE BIDEN.

39:34 IN 2016, THEY SURGED FOR DONALD TRUMP.

39:36 >> LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I'VE LEARNED OVER I DON'T EVEN WANT

39:38 TO TELL YOU HOW MANY YEARS. I STARTED IN THE 1960'S.

39:42 WHAT PEOPLE SAY IN MARCH THEY FREQUENTLY DO NOT FOLLOW UP ON

39:47 IN OCTOBER AND EARLY NOVEMBER.

39:50 >> THEY DON'T LIKE EITHER CANDIDATE.

39:52 2018 WAS LIKE THE HIGHEST MIDTERM ELECTION TURNOUT EVER.

39:54 2020 WAS HUGE. THIS ONE'S GOING TO BE REALLY,

40:00 REALLY LOW BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO CHOOSE WHO THEY HATE

40:03 LEAST. JOE: WHO DO THEY HATE THE LEAST?

40:16 ALL WITH US YESTERDAY ON SUPER TUESDAY.

40:18 FAST FORWARD TO THIS MORNING, NIKKI HALEY DROPS OUT AND WE

40:22 REASSEMBLE OF YOUR PANEL WITH THE FOUNDER OF THE WOMEN

40:24 LEADERS SERIOUS AND A PARTNER AT FOUR CORNERS PUBLIC AFFAIRS.

40:31 INTERESTING TO HEAR LARRY SABADO REMIND US THAT THINGS

40:34 PEOPLE SAY IN MARCH MAY NOT TRANSLATE IN NOVEMBER.

40:35 I JUST WONDER YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE QUESTION WE HAVE BEEN

40:39 ASKING EVERYONE.

40:44 >> WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED IS THE NIKKI HALEY VOTER IS LIKELY A

40:48 SUBURBAN WOMAN, COLLEGE-EDUCATED .

40:50 THOSE VOTERS DON'T NECESSARILY LOVE BIDEN OR TRUMP.

40:57 I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF DONALD TRUMP ENDS UP WITH A

41:00 RUNNING MATE -- THIS IS WHERE I WILL DISAGREE WITH JIM MESSINA

41:05 -- THAT MATTERS AND SOMEONE WHO EMBODIES A LOT OF NIKKI HALEY

41:13 WHO WILL PLAY MUCH BETTER IN THE SUBURBS OF AMERICA. KAILEY:

41:17 LIKE WHO?

41:19 >> I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE ANY NAMES, BUT I THINK IT'S SOMEONE

41:20 WHO CAN WALK INTO THE LIVING

41:26 ROOMS OF AMERICA AND CAN SPEAK TO WOMEN LIKE US. KAILEY:

41:28 SO A WOMAN?

41:29 >> THAT'S ONE OF THE CHARACTERISTICS NIKKI HALEY

41:33 EMBODIES. SHE ALSO COMES OFF AS NORMAL

41:37 AND CAN REALLY RELATE TO VOTERS AND WHAT'S GOING ON IN THEIR

41:39 LIVES AND RELATES TO THEIR STRUGGLES. JOE:

41:44 WITH THAT SAID, JOE BIDEN MIGHT SMELL AN OPPORTUNITY HERE TO

41:48 TRY TO TURN SOME OF THESE VOTERS WHO HAVE TOLD POLLSTERS

41:50 THAT THEY WILL NOT VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP. HOW DOES HE DO IT?

41:55 >> THE BLESSING OF NIKKI HALEY FOR JOE BIDEN IS THAT HE NOW

41:59 HAS A MAP OF EXACTLY THE PLACES WHERE THESE NIKKI HALEY VOTERS

42:05 IN THE STATES THAT VOTED NIKKI HALEY LIVE, WHERE THEY VOTE.

42:07 WE KNOW WHAT THEIR DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE IS.

42:09 WE ARE GOING AFTER THESE FOLKS WITH VERY TAILORED MESSAGES

42:13 BOTH ABOUT ISSUES THAT MATTER TO AMERICAN FAMILIES, BUT ALSO

42:15 HE HAS A STRONG OPPORTUNITY TO DRIVE A CONTRAST ABOUT DONALD

42:20 TRUMP AND REMIND THESE WOMEN WHY THEY HATE HIM SO MUCH AND

42:22 WHY THEY DID NOT VOTE FOR HIM IN 2020 OR 2022. JOE:

42:27 EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE PREPARED TO VOTE FOR A NEOCONSERVATIVE A

42:32 DAY EARLIER.

42:34 >> I PERSONALLY WOULD NOT HAVE VOTED FOR NIKKI HALEY, BUT THE

42:36 OTHER THING IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PRIMARIES THAT HAVE COME

42:37 OUT OF THIS ELECTION, YOU'VE GOT PEOPLE LIKE MARK ROBINSON

42:42 IN NORTH CAROLINA RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR NOW WHO SAYS WOMEN

42:45 SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO VOTE, SO THERE'S GOING TO BE THIS

42:48 ECHO CHAMBER OF REALLY EXTREME POSITIONS THAT REMINDS PEOPLE

42:52 THAT YOU'VE GOT ONE CHOICE WITH DONALD TRUMP AND ANOTHER WITH

42:56 JOE BIDEN, AND AT THE END OF THE DAY, I THINK WOMEN LIKE

42:58 HAVING RIGHTS. I THINK WOMEN LIKE HAVING

43:01 CREDIT CARDS AND THAT'S WHERE THEY WILL GO. KAILEY:

43:05 THERE'S ALSO THE QUESTION OF WHERE DONORS WILL GO.

43:11 A LOT OF BIG NIKKI HALEY DONORS HAVE SAID THEY ARE GOING DOWN

43:14 BALLOT AND SPENDING ON CONGRESSIONAL RACES.

43:18 WE KNOW BIDEN HAS AN INCREDIBLY LARGE WARCHEST. DONALD TRUMP IS

43:23 SPENDING TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON LEGAL BILLS.

43:26 HOW MUCH WILL THAT MATTER IN AN EIGHT MONTH LONG GENERAL

43:27 ELECTION CONTEST?

43:31 >> ONE THING DONALD TRUMP HAS ACCESS AND NOW TO IS THE RNC

43:37 AND THE RNC DONORS ON THE MONEY THE RNC HAS.

43:39 YOU ARE RIGHT, BUT WHAT YOU ARE POINTING OUT ABOUT DOWN BALLOT

43:42 RACES IS NOT A REPUBLICAN THING. IT IS AN ACROSS-THE-BOARD

43:46 POLITICAL THING IN THIS TOWN. THERE HAS BEEN A REALLY

43:48 INTERESTING TREND OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WHERE DONORS

43:52 SAY , I'M JUST GOING TO PAY FOR THE RACES I REALLY WANT TO

43:56 INVEST IN, AND I'M NOT NECESSARILY INVESTING IN

43:57 OVERREACHING ORGANIZATIONS THAT MAY BE SPENDING MONEY ON THINGS

44:00 THAT DON'T MATTER OR RACES THAT DON'T MATTER TO ME.

44:06 THE MORE CURIOUS WILL BE HOW MUCH MONEY IS BEING SPENT IN

44:10 ARIZONA, IN MICHIGAN, IN PENNSYLVANIA.

44:12 I THINK WE WILL SEE A LOT OF MONEY AND A COUPLE HANDFULS

44:17 WORTH OF RACES. KAILEY: IT WILL BE REALLY INTERESTING

44:23 TO SEE HOW THIS WHOLE THING SHAKES OUT IN NOVEMBER.

44:27 THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THIS EVENING, WHICH IS BOTH THE DAY

44:31 AFTER SUPER TUESDAY AND THE DAY BEFORE THE STATE.

44:33 OF COURSE, WE HAVE COVERAGE OF ALL OF IT AS ALWAYS IN

44:38 WASHINGTON EDITION NEWSLETTER ON THE TERMINAL ONLINE. JOE:

44:40 CAN HE BRING IT IN UNDER AN HOUR?

44:44 WE WILL FIND OUT -- EVERYONE IS SHAKING THEIR HEADS NO.
