Democratic Maryland Governor Wes Moore said a victory by Donald Trump in November would bring a “significant rollback” in gun control, in a warning to his party’s base about the impact of the Republican frontrunner returning to the White House.

“He’s shown us that his solution to gun violence is give more people guns,” Moore, who sits on President Joe Biden ’s campaign advisory board, told Bloomberg News in an interview Tuesday. “There’s no one in communities that we represent — that I came up in — that think that’s the right answer.”
