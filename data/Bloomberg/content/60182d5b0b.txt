Donald Trump has clinched the Republican presidential nomination, capping off a stunning political comeback fueled by grievance and vengeance and formally entering what’s poised to be the longest and costliest general election in recent memory.

That allows Trump free rein to consolidate the Republican Party’s political operation and fully turn his attention toward a rematch with President Joe Biden .
