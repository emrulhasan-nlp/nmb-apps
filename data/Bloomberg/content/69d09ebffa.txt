Rishi Sunak has spent months saying he wants the UK to lead the world in developing and regulating artificial intelligence. That strategy is finally taking shape.

The prime minister plans a summit later this year that aims, for the first time, to bring together world leaders and top AI executives in an event that’s supported by Joe Biden . The US president and other G7 leaders, along with tech chiefs including OpenAI chief Sam Altman , Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella , Anthropic’s Dario Amodei and DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis are expected to be invited, said people familiar with the plans.
