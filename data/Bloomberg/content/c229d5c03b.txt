00:21 >> I WOULD NOT ASSUME INFLATION WOULD BE SUPER STICKY BUT IT

00:23 WOULD BE BUMPY.

00:26 >> WE ARE TALKING ABOUT INFLATION BEHAVIOR.

00:29 WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT INFLATION ACCELERATING.

00:33 >> INFLATION WILL BE STICKY AND I THINK THAT WARRANTS THE FED

00:37 RETHINKING ITS INFLATION TARGET. >> THIS IS "BLOOMBERG

00:39 SURVEILLANCE" WITH JONATHAN FERRO, LISA

00:40 ABRAMOWICZ, AND ANNMARIE HORDERN. JONATHAN:

00:47 LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY, YOUR WEEK BEGINS RIGHT NOW.

00:51 FOR OUR AUDIENCE WORLDWIDE, THIS IS "BLOOMBERG

00:52 SURVEILLANCE." YOUR EQUITY MARKET HAS NOT DONE

00:57 MUCH OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS. AROUND 8:30 EXPECTED TO DO

01:00 SOMETHING. WE HAVE TO BEGIN WITH THE WORDS

01:05 OF CHAIRMAN POWELL, IT IS TOO SOON TO SEE WHETHER THE RECENT

01:10 READINGS ARE MORE THAN A BUMP. AT 8:30 WILL WE GET ANOTHER

01:12 BUMP? LISA: AND HOW MUCH CONSISTS OF A BUMP?

01:18 WE HAVE HEARD THIS FROM ANALYSTS SAYING IN-LINE PRINT

01:22 WILL BE A BEAT AND YOU WILL GET A RALLY IN MARKETS.

01:25 HOW THEY GIVE AN UPSIDE SURPRISE DO YOU NEED FOR THIS

01:28 FEDERAL RESERVE TO RECONSIDER THEIR DECISION TO CUT RATES IN

01:30 JUNE BUT THE CUT RATES THREE TIMES THIS YEAR? JONATHAN:

01:35 .3% MONTH OVER MONTH FOR CORE INFLATION IS THE ESTIMATE.

01:39 THE PREVIOUS NUMBER WAS .4%. YOU GO THROUGH THE NUMBERS,

01:44 VERY FEW PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR AN UPSIDE SURPRISE THIS MORNING.

01:47 ANNMARIE: YOU SEE SOME COMING IN WITH

01:49 LOWER. I GO TO STEPHEN STANLEY AT

01:52 SANTANDER. THE NUMBER OF ANALYSTS WHAT HE

01:58 SEES AS TRYING TO SPIN TOMORROW'S RESULTS.

02:00 THESE ARE EXPECTATIONS OF A BEAT.

02:03 WHEN HE LOOKS AT THAT WENT 3% RISE MONTH OVER MONTH, THAT

02:08 ENDS UP ANNUALLY BEING 3.6%. IT IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY FOR

02:12 ANYONE AT THE FED, FOR THAT NUMBER TO SATISFY THEM. LISA:

02:18 THE BEARISH BETS ON TREASURIES ARE SKYROCKETING AHEAD OF THIS

02:21 REPORT WHICH SETS THE MARKET UP FOR A MASSIVE SHORT SQUEEZE IF

02:23 WE GET ANYTHING OTHER THAN A HUGE UPSIDE BEAT.

02:28 YOU TALK ABOUT MARKET EXPECTATIONS.

02:30 HOW BIG DOES THAT UPSIDE SURPRISE HAVE TO BE TO FULFILL

02:33 BEARISH BETS OF PEOPLE EXPECTING RUNAWAY INFLATION.

02:37 IF WE DON'T GET THAT COULD WE GET A MONSTER RALLY IN BONDS

02:39 AND A MONSTER RALLY IN STOCKS? JONATHAN:

02:42 BULLISH BETS ON ENERGY RIGHT NOW.

02:45 LORI CALVASINA STEPPING WITH ENERGY.

02:47 MIKE WILSON OVERWEIGHT ENERGY. MARK AT J.P.

02:52 MORGAN, STAY OVERWEIGHT COMMODITIES.

02:54 THAT HAS BECOME A CONSENSUS CALL. LISA:

02:59 AND IT HAS BECOME THE HEDGE AGAINST INFLATION.

03:02 IT IS NOT JUST OIL, IT IS ALSO GOLD.

03:05 ONE OF THE BIGGEST MYSTERIES AS IT HITS ALL-TIME HIGH.

03:09 IT IS ALSO IRON ORE, IT IS ALL THE PRECIOUS METALS. ANNMARIE:

03:13 WE HERE ANALYSTS AFTER ANALYSTS TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY ARE

03:14 OVERWEIGHT. STUART KAISER WAS TALKING ABOUT

03:18 THE FACT THAT OIL NEEDS TO PROVE ITSELF.

03:21 HOW MUCH OF THIS IS TEMPORARY AND DOES THE FED LOOK THROUGH

03:27 IT? JONATHAN:

03:28 CRUDE POSITIVE .33%. THE BROADER PRICE ACTION

03:33 SHAPING UP AS FOLLOWS ON THE S&P 500.

03:35 MILD DAYS OF PRICE ACTION. MONDAY DOWN A LITTLE BIT.

03:40 TODAY TOTALLY UNCHANGED ON THE S&P.

03:45 JIM REED AT DEUTSCHE BANK, WE HAVE GONE SEVEN CONSECUTIVE

03:46 SESSIONS WITHOUT A NEW RECORD. THE LONGEST WITHOUT AN ALL-TIME

03:49 HIGH SINCE JANUARY. LISA: THE ONLY NEGATIVE THING YOU CAN

03:54 SAY ABOUT A RALLY THAT HAS NOT GONE DOWN VERY MUCH.

03:57 THERE HAS BEEN REALLY INTERESTING PRICE ACTION UNDER

03:58 THE HOOD. YOU'VE SEEN THE MAGNIFICENT

04:01 SEVEN UNDERPERFORMING. THE VIDEO WAS FASCINATING.

04:06 THE FACT INTEL CAME OUT WITH A CHIP THAT MAY OR MAY NOT TAKE

04:08 OFF. INTEL SHARES, MET, NVIDIA DOWN.

04:16 THERE IS A FEELING PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO HEDGE THE HIGH FLYERS.

04:19 JONATHAN: YIELDS UNCHANGED, LOWER

04:22 YESTERDAY ON THE TENURE. AT THE MOMENT FOR .36.

04:28 COMING UP THIS HOUR DAN MORRIS OF BNP PARIBAS.

04:33 TOBIN MARCUS OF WOLFE RESEARCH, AND BLOOMBERG'S GEORGE FERGUSON

04:37 WITH NEW CONCERNS OVER AT BOEING.

04:39 WE BEGIN WITH THE TOP STORY COME INVESTORS WEIGHING TODAY'S

04:44 INFLATION DATA. DAN MORRIS SAYING "MARCH CPI

04:48 DATA WILL BE CRITICAL, TELLING US WHETHER THE BIG INCREASE IN

04:52 INFLATION WAS JUST A BLIP AND WHETHER GOODS INFLATION IS

04:54 RETURNING." ARE THESE PUMPS IN THE ROAD OR

04:56 NEW TERRAIN? DAN:

05:03 AS POINTED OUT FROM ONE OF YOUR PREVIOUS COMMENTATORS, WE ARE

05:04 STILL TALKING ABOUT A LOWER LEVEL OF INFLATION BY THE END

05:06 OF THE YEAR. WE DO NOT WANT TO GET TOO

05:08 CARRIED AWAY. NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT A

05:14 RE-ACCELERATION IN GROWTH OR A REACCELERATION IN INFLATION OR

05:15 A FED HIKE AS OPPOSED TO CUTS. IS A QUESTION OF HOW SMOOTH THE

05:20 PATH IS BUT IT IS GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

05:25 EVEN IF WE GET THAT .3% WHICH WOULD BE 3.6 WHICH IS NOT TO

05:28 PERCENT, THAT IS TOO MUCH. WE EXPECT IT WILL GO DOWN AND

05:32 THAT IS WHAT WE WANT TO PURPOSE ON. JONATHAN:

05:38 YIELDS HAVE REPRICED HIGHER BY AROUND 50 BASIS POINTS

05:39 YEAR-TO-DATE AT THE FRONT END ON THE TWO YEAR, ON THE TENURE

05:42 AS WELL. AS THE BOAT BECOME TOO LOADED

05:46 IN THE BOND MARKET? DAN: WE ARE LOOKING AT STEEPENERS.

05:53 IN ANTICIPATION PHENOMENAL REAL YIELDS IN THE BELLY OF THE

05:55 CURVE TO START GOING DOWN. THERE IS A VIEW THAT IF YOU

06:00 THINK ABOUT POSITIONING, WHERE THE MARKET HAS GONE AT THIS

06:03 POINT, IT HAS GONE TO THE OTHER EXTREME AND WE THINK THERE IS A

06:05 POTENTIAL TO MOVE BACK IN THE OTHER DIRECTION. LISA:

06:09 THIS IS THE REASON SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING IF WE GET IN IN-LINE

06:12 PRINT OR A LOWER-THAN-EXPECTED INFLATION RATE, IT WILL BE A

06:18 RIPROARING RALLY IN BONDS AS PEOPLE GO BACK TO THIS IDEA

06:19 INFLATION IS COMING DOWN. WOULD YOU BE AN ACTIVE BUYER OF

06:24 DURATION IF WE GET A DOWNSIDE SURPRISE? DAN:

06:29 IT CERTAINLY WOULD HELP IF YOU CAME IN AT TO PUT -- IF YOU

06:32 CAME IN AT .2%. I DON'T KNOW HOW LIKELY THAT IS.

06:37 THE HEADLINE FIGURE COME IT WILL MATTER WHAT THE COMPONENTS

06:38 ARE. WE TALK ABOUT RENT, WHICH WAS.

06:45 MATTER FOR THE PCE -- WHICH DOES NOT MATTER FOR THE PCE.

06:49 IT WILL BE THE STICKINESS OF SERVICES INFLATION.

06:54 WITH THE PAYROLLS DATA WE GOT LAST WEEK, AVERAGE HOURLY

06:55 EARNINGS CONTINUE TO FALL.

07:01 THE BIG QUESTIONS WILL BE GOODS INFLATION WHICH HAS STARTED TO

07:03 TURN UP GIVEN THE ISSUES WE HAVE IN SHIPPING IN THE MIDDLE

07:06 EAST. LISA: IF WE GET SOME SORT OF RALLY IN

07:09 BONDS WILL THAT BE POSITIVE FOR STOCKS?

07:13 WILL THAT FUEL A NEW LEG OF THE RALLY OR IS THAT A QUESTION

07:17 MARK AROUND WHY BONDS ARE RALLYING AND THE POTENTIAL FOR

07:18 WEAKNESS LATER ON? DAN: IT DEPENDS A LOT ON THE

07:23 INCREASE OR THE DECREASE. WE KNOW HOW SENSITIVE STOCKS

07:27 ARE TO MOVES IN REAL RATES. IF IT IS A LOWER RATE AND WE

07:32 PUT BACK CUTS FROM THE FED, I WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE FOR GROWTH

07:34 STOCKS. IF IT IS HIGHER INFLATION THAT

07:38 IS NOT NECESSARILY SO BAD. RATES DO NOT GO DOWN SO MUCH,

07:43 BUT WE ARE AT THE LEVELS WE ARE AT. MORE INFLATION SHOULD MEAN

07:46 HIGHER REVENUES. THERE IS A SCENARIO WHERE AS

07:51 LONG AS IT IS NOT WEAK GROWTH DATA, EQUITIES SHOULD BE

07:52 SUPPORTED. ANNMARIE: YOU JUST MENTIONED

07:56 TRANSPORTATION PROBLEMS IN THE MIDDLE EAST. IS THAT REALLY AN

08:00 IMPACT ON GOODS IN THE UNITED STATES?

08:03 ISN'T THIS MORE OF A EUROPEAN PROBLEM? DAN:

08:06 WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE DATA GET IN EVEN IF YOU LOOK AT THE

08:10 EUROPEAN INFLATION DATA WE HAVE ALREADY GOTTEN FOR MARCH, WE

08:13 SHOULD NOT FORGET THAT WHEN WE HAD THAT INITIAL SURPRISE IN

08:17 CPI INFLATION IN THE U.S. WE THOUGHT IT WAS JUST A U.S.

08:21 PROBLEM, BUT THEN WE SAW ON THE SERVICES SIDE IT SHOWED UP IN

08:24 EUROPE AS WELL IN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY.

08:26 THE MARCH DATA OUT OF EUROPE WAS MUCH LOWER.

08:30 THAT MAY INDICATE WE ARE GOING TO SEE A DECREASE.

08:34 WHETHER OR NOT THE GOODS INFLATION SPREADS TO THE U.S.

08:37 OR MIDDLE EAST IS NOT A HUGE FACTOR.

08:41 LOW GOODS INFLATION HAS BEEN A BIG PART OF THE DECLINE IN CPI

08:42 OVER THE LAST YEAR. ANNMARIE: EVEN THOUGH COMMODITY PRICES,

08:49 THE PRICES OF CRUDE ARE TRICKLING DOWN, DO NOT IMPACT

08:52 CORE, HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THIS SURGE IN COMMODITIES WHEN YOU

08:56 ARE THINKING ABOUT AN UPTICK IN INFLATION? DAN:

09:01 WE LIKE COMMODITIES AND WE ARE OVERWEIGHT AND WE APPRECIATE

09:05 SOME OF THAT IS JUST A HEDGE AGAINST INFLATION.

09:08 WE KNOW IT IS ALSO A REFLECTION OF THE GEOPOLITICAL RISKS WE

09:12 ARE FACING AND NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE OF THE INCREASE IN

09:13 DEMAND. THAT IS WHAT WE WANT OVER THE

09:18 MEDIUM TERM, TO THINK PRICES WILL BE SUSTAINABLY HIGHER.

09:21 FOR NOW WE SEE IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY. JONATHAN:

09:24 LET'S TALK ABOUT NVIDIA. LISA MENTIONED THE STOCK WAS

09:28 DOWN CLOSE TO LOWE'S. THEN WE HAD NUMBERS FROM TSMC,

09:34 QUARTERLY REVENUE EXPLODING HIGHER.

09:37 THE MAIN CHIPMAKER TO NVIDIA, TO APPLE COME A 60% RISE IN

09:40 MARCH QUARTER SALES. IS THERE ANYTHING TO WORRY

09:44 ABOUT IN THAT SPACE IN THE STOCK MARKET? DAN:

09:48 IF WE THINK MORE BROADLY ABOUT THE OUTLOOK FOR EARNINGS IN

09:53 TECH, IF YOU TAKE THE NASDAQ AND TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH FORWARD

09:56 EARNINGS HAVE GONE UP OVER THE LAST YEAR, BIG CHUNK OF THAT IS

10:00 MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, A LOT OF IT IS SEMICONDUCTORS.

10:05 TO SOME DEGREE IRRESPECTIVE OF WHAT HAPPENS AROUND

10:10 SEMICONDUCTORS YOU WANT TO SEE EARNINGS MOMENTUM IN THE OTHER

10:12 PARTS OF THE MARKET, OTHER PARTS OF THE VALUE MARKET. LISA:

10:16 WHAT ARE YOU DOING AROUND THAT? ARE YOU REDUCING SOME OF YOUR

10:22 EXPOSURE TO SOME OF THOSE TECH HIGH FLYERS AND MOVING INTO

10:24 OTHER AREAS LIKE COMMODITIES AND CYCLICALS? DAN:

10:27 WE LIKE TECH. WE ARE NEUTRAL ON THE U.S..

10:32 IT IS A MATTER WHERE YOU SEE THE BEST RELATIVE OPPORTUNITY.

10:36 WE ARE MORE INTERESTED IN CHINA IMPACT.

10:39 WE ALL KNOW ABOUT THE VALUATION STORY.

10:43 ARE WE AT THE BOTTOM IN TERMS OF THE EARNINGS DOWNGRADES WE

10:44 HAVE SEEN? IF THAT IS STARTING TO TURN

10:50 AROUND, THAT IS AN EXAMPLE OF A BETTER PLACE TO TAKE A POSITION

10:54 WHERE YOU HAVE MORE UPSIDE THAN TRYING TO PREDICT WHAT IS GOING

10:55 TO HAPPEN TO NVIDIA NEXT. JONATHAN:

11:00 ARE YOU SAYING YOUR MORE CONSTRUCTIVE CHINESE TECH THAN

11:01 U.S. TECH? DAN: WE ARE OVERWEIGHT CHINESE

11:06 EQUITIES AND MORE OF THE LARGE-CAP DOMESTIC SPACE.

11:10 JONATHAN: INTERESTING. DAN MORRIS OF BNP PARIBAS.

11:15 PRAY TO CATCH UP. STRONG NUMBERS -- GREAT TO

11:18 CATCH UP.

11:24 STRONG NUMBERS FROM TAIWAN SEMICONDUCTORS.

11:27 TOM TZITZOURIS WILL JOIN US LATER.

11:29 HERE'S A FLAVOR OF WHAT HE WILL HAVE TO SAY.

11:33 "WASHINGTON IS COMMITTED TO RUN THE ECONOMY OF FULHAM

11:36 EMPLOYMENT AT ALL COSTS UNTIL THE ELECTION IN THE FED IS

11:38 LOOKING FOR EVERY EXCUSE POSSIBLE TO CUT TO AID THIS

11:40 CAUSE." IN THE NEXT HOUR BLOOMBERG

11:44 SURVEILLANCE. LISA: WHICH IS WHAT PEOPLE SAY

11:48 USUALLY QUIETLY AND NOT WHEN THERE ON AIR, BUT THE SUSPICION

11:55 THIS FEDERAL RESERVE IS BIASED TOWARDS KEEPING THE ECONOMY

11:56 HOTTER THAN KOHLER RUNNING INTO THE ELECTION.

11:58 I WILL NOT GOING TO THAT. HE WILL.

12:02 IT DOES RAISE A QUESTION OF WHY. WHAT GIVES PEOPLE CONVICTION?

12:07 IS THIS WHAT IS GIVING THEM A SENSE THAT THIS FED WILL CUT,

12:12 EVEN IF THE DATA IS NOT COOPERATING? ANNMARIE:

12:13 HE SAID THE QUIET PART THAT PEOPLE TELL US BEHIND THE

12:16 SCENES OUT LOUD. THAT IS WHY INFLATION IS SO

12:19 IMPORTANT. IF YOU'RE TRYING TO RUN AN

12:25 ECONOMY THAT IS HOT AND AT THE SAME TIME TRY TO QUELL

12:28 INFLATION . THIS IS WHAT COMES UP IN POLLS.

12:33 ANNMARIE: INFLATION -- JONATHAN: INFLATION DATA AT 8:30.

12:40 LET'S GIVE AN UPDATE ON STORIES ELSEWHERE.

12:42 HERE IS YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF WITH DANI BURGER. DANI:

12:47 AT LEAST THREE PEOPLE ARE DEAD AFTER AN EXPLOSION AT A

12:49 NORTHERN IN EARLY HYDROPOWER PLANT. THE COMPANY SAYS THE FIRE

12:54 IMPACTED A TRANSFORMER IT WITHOUT PROVIDING FURTHER

12:55 DETAILS. THEY ARE ITALY'S LARGEST POWER

12:59 SUPPLIER AND THEY SHUT THE PLANT DOWN IMMEDIATELY FOR

13:03 SAFETY REASONS BUT LOCAL POWER SUPPLY WAS NOT AFFECTED.

13:07 FITCH HAS CUT ITS OUTLOOK FOR CHINA'S LONG-TERM DEBT FROM

13:08 NEGATIVE TO STABLE. RISING ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES

13:12 HAVE ERODED FISCAL BUFFERS. ALTHOUGH FITCH SEES GOVERNMENT

13:16 DEBT INCREASING, IT AFFIRMED CHINA'S A-PLUS RATING.

13:19 MORE TROUBLE FOR BOWING. THE FAA IS INVESTIGATING

13:25 WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINTS THE COMPANY TOOK SHORTCUTS TO EASE

13:29 PRODUCTION BOTTLENECKS ON THE 747 DREAMLINER.

13:33 THE PLAYMAKER SAYS THE CLAIMS ARE INACCURATE AND DOES NOT

13:36 REPRESENT THE WORK IT HAS DONE TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THE

13:37 PLANE. SHARES OF BOEING ARE DOWN THIS

13:40 YEAR. SCRUTINY OF MANUFACTURING PRACTICES HAVE BEEN BUILDING

13:45 SINCE ONE OF THE PLANES EXPERIENCED A MIDAIR ACCIDENT

13:47 EARLY JANUARY. JONATHAN: THIS COMES WITH A WARNING.

13:53 IF YOU ARE FLYING WITH BOEING THIS MORNING TURN THE VOLUME

13:54 DOWN.

14:01 FACTORY MURDERS MEASURED -- FAULTY MEASURED GAPS THAT OCCUR

14:04 WHEN PIECES OF THE 787 ARE JOINED TOGETHER.

14:09 FATIGUE CAN IMPAIR THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF MORE

14:11 THAN 1000 OF THE WIDE-BODY JETS IT SERVICED.

14:13 THESE ALLEGATIONS ARE SOMETHING. LISA:

14:17 HE SAID HE HAD SERIOUS ACTS OF RETALIATIONS AGAINST HIM AND

14:21 THE PREVIOUS WHISTLEBLOWER DIED OF A SELF-INFLICTED GUNSHOT

14:25 WOUND LAST YEAR. A LOT MOUNTING. JONATHAN:

14:28 MORE ON BOEING LATER THIS MORNING. UP NEXT, U.S.

14:31 STEEL IN FOCUS.

14:36 >> THE RELATIONSHIP IS BIGGER AND MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN A

14:38 SINGLE COMMERCIAL TRANSACTION AND THAT WILL CONTINUE.

14:42 JONATHAN: THAT CONVERSATION IS UP NEXT.

15:30 JONATHAN: IT IS CPI WEDNESDAY. DATA JUST AROUND THE CORNER.

15:35 EQUITY FUTURES TOTALLY UNCHANGED.

15:41 MUTED PRICE ACTION MONDAY AND TUESDAY.

15:44 IN BETWEEN, INTRADAY TUESDAY BIG SWINGS.

15:47 I CANNOT EXPLAIN THEM BUT THEY EXISTED. ON THE 10 YEAR 4.3577.

15:52 U.S. STEEL IN FOCUS.

15:58 >> FOR FOUR YEARS IN A ROW THE UNITED STATES AND JAPAN ARE THE

16:00 NUMBER ONE PART INVESTORS IN EACH OTHER'S COUNTRIES.

16:05 IN 2021 THERE WAS ELECTION IN JAPAN AND FOREIGN ENTITIES WERE

16:08 LOOKING AT BUYING TOSHIBA AND JAPAN SAID FOR NATIONAL

16:09 SECURITY INTEREST THAT WOULD NOT BE PERMITTED.

16:12 THERE IS A CONTEXT. ONE IS THE RELATIONSHIP IS

16:18 BIGGER AND MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN A SINGLE COMMERCIAL

16:20 TRANSACTION AND THAT WILL CONTINUE.

16:26 JONATHAN: THE JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER IN

16:29 WASHINGTON FOR THE COUNTRY'S FIRST STATE VISIT TO THE U.S.

16:30 IN NINE YEAR. HANGING OVER THE VISIT, NIPPON

16:35 STEEL'S TAKEOVER OF U.S. STEEL. "JAPANESE OFFICIALS BELIEVE

16:38 THEIR BEST PLAY IS TO STAY QUIET AND WORK WITH THE

16:42 COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN INVESTMENT TO TRY TO SECURE A

16:45 RECOMMENDATION. AVOID PUTTING BITING ON THE

16:50 DEFENSIVE AND SEE IF THE SITUATION IMPROVES AFTER THE

16:51 ELECTION." TOBIN JOINS US. A BIG ELEMENT OF THIS IS TO TRY

16:57 TO SECURE THE VOTE IN PLACES LIKE PENNSYLVANIA.

16:59 IS THAT WORKING? TOBIN: IT IS NOT WORKING YET.

17:06 BIDEN IS STILL BEHIND IN THE POLLS AND ALL OF THE STATES HE

17:08 NEEDS TO WIN. ALL WITHIN COMPETITION DISTANCE

17:14 FOR BOTH CANDIDATES. IT HAS NOT WORKED YET BUT IT IS

17:20 UNDERSTANDABLE THAT BIDEN AND THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN ARE LOOKING

17:23 AT THAT POLITICAL TERRITORY WITH A VERY KENAI.

17:28 -- WITH A VERY KEEN EYE. JONATHAN: YOU SINCE THE JAPANESE

17:33 UNDERSTAND OR DO WE RISK ISOLATING SOME OF OUR ALLIES?

17:36 TOBIN: I THINK THEY GET IT. WE HAVE SEEN IN THE RESPONSE

17:42 FROM THE PRIME MINISTER, THE WAY BIDEN CAME OUT SURPRISINGLY

17:45 STRONGLY AGAINST THE DEAL A FEW WEEKS AGO, THEY UNDERSTAND

17:48 THERE IS NO PERCENTAGE IN PRESSING HIM ON IT.

17:53 THE COMPANY IS VERY GUNG HO ON THE DEAL.

17:55 YOU ARE SEEING LOTS AND LOTS OF ADVERTISING AND LOBBYING

18:00 FOCUSED ON D.C. TYPES TOUTING THE ECONOMIC

18:01 BENEFITS OF THE DEAL. THEY ARE TRYING TO ENGAGE WITH

18:04 THE UNION EVEN THOUGH THE U.S. WC IS AGAINST THE DEAL.

18:10 IT IS NOT AS IF THE JAPANESE HAVE GIVEN UP BUT AT THE

18:13 GOVERNMENTAL LEVEL THEY ARE NOT MAKING IT THE NUMBER ONE

18:14 PRIORITY. THE SUMMIT IS FOCUSED ON

18:16 SECURITY ISSUES AND DEFENSE COOPERATION WHERE THE MUTUAL

18:20 ISSUES ARE MORE ALIGNED. THEY'LL TRY TO GET A GOOD

18:24 OUTCOME BUT IT IS NOT A FOREGONE CONCLUSION. ANNMARIE:

18:30 WHEN IT COMES TO THE REVIEW, THE ADMINISTRATION IS LOOKING

18:31 AT WHETHER THERE IS A CONNECTION TO CHINA.

18:34 YOU THINK THAT IS WARRANTED? TOBIN: THIS IS ALL DOWNSTREAM OF

18:38 POLITICS. IF YOU ARE DOING A PURELY

18:43 NEUTRAL REVIEW WITH NO CONCERNS ABOUT POLITICS WHATSOEVER, IF

18:46 THIS WERE A COMPANY THAT DID NOT HAVE UNITED STATES IN THE

18:51 NAME AND HAD AN ICONIC LEGACY TO IT, I DO NOT THINK THERE

18:54 WOULD BE PROBLEMS. AS WE ARE SEEING IN THE SUMMIT MORE

18:59 BROADLY, JAPAN IS PROBABLY OUR MOST IMPORTANT ALLY IN THE INDO

19:02 PACIFIC, ONE OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT ALLIES GLOBALLY.

19:04 THE JAPANESE CONTROL OF U.S. COMPANIES IS NOT A SECURITY

19:07 CONCERN. STEEL IS A SPECIAL CASE, BUT I

19:15 THINK WE ARE SEEING AN EXERCISE IN MITIGATING THE POTENTIAL

19:18 POLITICAL LIABILITY OF ALLOWING THIS "ICONIC U.S. COMPANY"

19:23 TO BE ACQUIRED BY A FOREIGN ENTITY. ANNMARIE:

19:28 WHEN YOU TALK TO JAPANESE OFFICIALS THEY SAY UNITING

19:29 THESE COMPANIES WOULD BE A FORCE AGAINST CHINA.

19:33 ARE WE AT RISK IN WASHINGTON TO CREATE A BOY THAT CRIED WOLF

19:36 SITUATION WHEN IT COMES TO NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS?

19:41 TOBIN: YOU HEARD THIS A MOMENT AGO IN

19:43 THE COOKIE PLATE. IT IS NOT -- IN THE CLIP YOU

19:46 PLAYED. IT IS NOT UNIQUE TO THE U.S.

19:52 FOR THERE TO BE POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ECONOMIC

19:55 CONSIDERATIONS TO PROTECT DOMESTIC CHAMPIONS IN VARIOUS

19:56 INDUSTRIES. IT IS NOT THE IDEAL SITUATION.

20:00 IT IS NOT WHAT YOU WOULD WANT. I THINK THEY GET IT.

20:07 IT IS NOT DERAILING THE OTHER EFFORTS TO GET A TIGHTER

20:11 RELATIONSHIP. THE SUITE OF DELIVERABLES BEING

20:16 ROLLED OUT, BOTH SIDES FEEL GOOD ABOUT IN TERMS OF JAPAN'S

20:21 CONTINUED SHIFT TOWARDS BEING A FULL-SPECTRUM GEOPOLITICAL

20:24 ACTOR IN THE INDO PACIFIC, UNDERGOING THEIR OWN MILITARY

20:26 MODERNIZATION AND PREPARING TO COOPERATE A LOT MORE WITH U.S.

20:28 IN DETERRING CHINA. LISA: IS GETTING HARDER TO

20:33 DISTINGUISH POLITICS FROM POLICY.

20:35 I WANT TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS AHEAD OF AN ANALYST -- AHEAD OF

20:39 OUR CONVERSATION WITH AN ANALYST TO STRATEGAS WILL STEP

20:45 HE SAID "WASHINGTON IS -- THE FED IS LOOKING FOR EVERY EXCUSE

20:47 POSSIBLE TO CUT TO AID THIS CAUSE."

20:50 WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THIS ASSESSMENT?

20:52 IS THAT THE FEELING FROM THE CLIENTS YOU SPEAK TO? TOBIN:

20:58 IT IS A VERY ACTIVE DEBATE AMONG MY CLIENTS AND OTHER

21:01 FOLKS IN THE D.C. SPACE, THE EXTENT TO WHICH FED

21:03 DECISION-MAKING IS POLITICIZED. I DO NOT AGREE WITH THE NOTION

21:08 THAT THE FED IS PUTTING ITS FINGER ON THE SCALE FOR THE

21:10 SAKE OF AN OUTCOME. I'VE HAVE HEARD THAT TALKING

21:13 POINT A LOT.

21:20 POWELL'S THEIR POLITICAL INCENTIVE IS TO WRITE UP INTO

21:23 THE SUNSET AS THE PERSON WHO DEFEATED THIS INFLATION.

21:27 HE CARES MORE ABOUT HIS LEGACY THEN HE DOES ABOUT GETTING

21:31 REAPPOINTED FOR THE POLITICAL ATTACKS HE WILL FACE FROM BOTH

21:33 SIDES DEPENDING ON WHEN THEY CUT. IF THEY CUT IN JUNE OR JULY

21:40 THEY WILL BE CRITICIZED FOR CUTTING TOO EARLY OR TOO MUCH.

21:43 IF THEY CUT IN SEPTEMBER THEY WILL BE CRITICIZED FOR CUTTING

21:47 TOO LATE BEFORE THE ELECTION.

21:53 IF HE CUTS IN DECEMBER HE WILL BE CRITICIZED FOR HELPING FRONT.

21:59 HE IS DAMNED IF THEY DO, DAMNED

22:05 IF THEY DON'T HIS CHALLENGE IS THE APPROPRIATE PATH FOR RATES.

22:10 I THINK WE ARE SEEING AN AUTHENTIC EFFORT TO MANAGE BOTH

22:12 SIDES OF THE DUAL MANDATE. LISA: THERE IS A QUESTION OF WHETHER

22:17 THE FED COMES UNDER ATTACK IN TERMS OF ITS LEGITIMACY AND

22:21 ANOTHER ADMINISTRATION AND WHETHER IT HAS AN INCENTIVE TO

22:22 PRESERVE MORE OF THE STATUS QUO. THIS IS ONE OF THE CONSPIRACY

22:27 THEORIES UNDERPINNING THIS WHICH IS THE REASON WE HEAR

22:28 THIS SO MUCH. TOBIN: RIGHT.

22:30 IF YOU GAVE JAY POWELL TRUTH SERUM, WOULD HE PREFER BIDEN TO

22:36 TRUMP? PROBABLY. HE IS A REGISTERED REPUBLICAN.

22:40 IT IS NOT AS IF HE IS SOMEONE WHOSE TRACK RECORD WOULD

22:44 SUGGEST YOU WOULD MOVE HEAVEN AND EARTH TO GET BIDEN

22:47 REELECTED. WHEN WE LOOK BACKWARDS AT THE

22:50 RECORD OF WHAT FED POLICY HAS BEEN IN ELECTION YEARS SINCE

22:57 NIXON AND BURNS, WE DO NOT SEE EVIDENCE THERE IS A HISTORICAL

22:59 PATTERN AROUND ELECTION INTERFERENCE.

23:02 YOU ARE NO MORE LIKELY TO GET CUTS THAN HIKES IN ELECTION

23:03 YEARS. WE SEE THE DEVIATION BETWEEN

23:07 THE TAYLOR RULE AND FED FUNDS RATES IN ELECTION YEARS IS MORE

23:12 HAWKISH THAN IT IS IN NONELECTION YEARS.

23:16 I THINK THERE IS NOT A LOT OF EMPIRICAL TRACK RECORDS TO

23:19 POINT TO ON THIS AND I DO NOT THINK IT MAKES SENSE FOR JAY

23:21 POWELL. HE IS TOWARDS THE END OF HIS

23:23 CAREER. HE WOULD LIKE TO GET REAPPOINTED, BUT I THINK HE

23:28 CARES MUCH MORE ABOUT NOT MISMANAGING THE SITUATION AND

23:33 GOING DOWN IN HISTORY AS THE PERSON WHO ALLOWED A BIG

23:37 REACCELERATION IN INFLATION AND FAILED AT THE HISTORICALLY

23:39 IMPORTANT JOB HE IS FACING AT THIS INFLECTION POINT.

23:43 IN TERMS OF LEGITIMACY OF THE FIT, THEY WILL FACE OUR

23:44 POLITICAL ATTACKS NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO.

23:47 I DO NOT THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO SOLVE TO THAT.

23:49 I DON'T BUY THIS. THE THEORY IS OUT THERE.

23:53 I'M NOT ON BOARD. JONATHAN: TOBIN MARCUS OF WOLFE RESEARCH.

23:58 SUPER DIPLOMATIC. IT TO HIS POINT IT DOES NOT

24:04 MATTER WHEN THEY GO, THEY WILL BE CRITICIZED BY SOMEONE. LISA:

24:08 WHAT HE SAID IS THIS FED CHAIR DOES NOT WANT TO GO DOWN IN

24:12 HISTORY AS ARTHUR BURNS, AS FUELING IN INFLATION SURGE THAT

24:15 WAS AKIN TO THE 1970'S. JONATHAN: JONATHAN:

24:18 I DON'T KNOW ABOUT RETIRING. DON'T YOU WANT TO DELIVER MORE

24:21 MILLION-DOLLAR SPEECHES? IF I COULD DELIVER A ONE

24:26 MILLION-DOLLAR SPEECH, I'M NOT EVEN HIDING THAT.

24:30 I AM NOT SURE WHAT I WOULD TALK ABOUT.

24:46 JONATHAN: WE ARE GOING ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE

24:48 GOING INTO INFLATION DATA. THE S&P UNCHANGED.

24:52 LIKEWISE ON THE NASDAQ. ON THE SMALL CAPS AND THE

24:55 RUSSELL WE SPOT A THEME. GOING ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE.

25:02 TEN-YEAR AND 30-YOU'RE GOING SOMEWHERE.

25:05 UP BY 40 OR 50 BASIS POINTS. JUST ABOUT UNCHANGED AFTER A

25:08 RALLY YESTERDAY. 435.77 ON A TEN-YEAR.

25:16 TWO-YEAR, 473.86. CRUDE JUST STARTED TO BREAK

25:21 BACK BELOW $90 ON BRENT. LISA: YOU DID SEE A BIT OF A REPRIEVE

25:25 IN THE BOND MARKET. PEOPLE ARE SAYING MAYBE WE GOT

25:28 AHEAD OF OUR SKIS. THERE WAS A HINT OF THAT COMING

25:34 OUT YESTERDAY EVEN WITH A THREE-YOUR OPTION THAT DID NOT

25:35 GO THAT WELL. THERE'S ANOTHER TEN-YEAR NOTE

25:40 OPTION TODAY AT 1:00 P.M. AFTER THE CPI PRINT.

25:48 I'M CURIOUS WHETHER IT AND FLEX --FLEXES WHEN WE ARE ANOTHER.

25:50 JONATHAN: IF YOU WANT TO BUY SOME

25:55 30-YEARS TOMORROW, $22 BILLION WORTH OF SUPPLY COMING TO

25:56 MARKET. COMPARE WHAT'S HAPPENING TO

25:59 WHAT'S HAPPENING IN PRECIOUS METALS.

26:01 THE RALLY HAS BEEN RELENTLESS. IN MARCH, GOLD WAS UP SOMETHING

26:05 LIKE 9%. WE HAD ANOTHER DECENT MOVE IN

26:07 APRIL. JUST ALL-TIME HIGHS. LISA:

26:12 THIS GOES BACK TO WHAT MOHAMED EL-ERIAN WAS TALKING ABOUT.

26:15 CENTRAL BANKS ARE BUYING. CHINA IS BUYING.

26:18 THERE'S DIVERSIFICATION AWAY FROM THE DOLLAR.

26:22 NOT THE END OF AMERICA AS WE KNOW IT, ETC.

26:25 SOME PEOPLE MIGHT GO THERE. GOOD LUCK.

26:31 WHETHER IT IS SOME SORT OF INDICTMENT ON THE IDEA OF

26:33 TREASURIES AS A HAVEN ASSET. JONATHAN:

26:36 WAS THIS ABOUT SANCTIONS OR ABOUT TREASURY SUPPLY?

26:38 HE SAID IT'S ABOUT SANCTIONS. ANNMARIE:

26:45 HE DID NOT LIKE THE TERM DE-DOLLARIZATION.

26:47 YOU HEAR THIS A LOT FROM PEOPLE. THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE WHEN THE

26:53 LOOKING AT CENTRAL BANKS THAT THIS IS WHY THEY ARE

26:58 DIVERSIFYING. IF THIS IS WHERE POLICY IS

27:02 TODAY, WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THERE IS MORE GEOPOLITICAL RISK IN

27:03 THE WORLD AND THEY CAN GO BACK TO THE SANCTIONS POLICY?

27:09 JONATHAN: UNDER SURVEILLANCE THIS

27:11 MORNING, TOP STORIES. BOEING'S WORRIES CONTINUE.

27:17 THE WHISTLEBLOWER SAYS THE COMEDY CUT CORNERS ON THE

27:21 SIBLEY OF THE 787 DREAMLINER, WHICH MAY DRAMATICALLY REDUCE

27:22 THE LIFE OF THE PLANE. THE OUTGOING CEO DAVE CALHOUN

27:27 CALLED TO TESTIFY ON CAPITOL HILL ON APRIL 17.

27:30 SOMETIMES WE TALK ABOUT A GRILLING AND THEY WILL NOT GET

27:31 A GRILLING. I THINK THIS GUY WILL GET A

27:33 GRILLING ON CAPITOL HILL. ANNMARIE:

27:39 BOEING HAS REPEATED SHOCKING ALLEGATIONS ABOUT THE FAILINGS

27:43 TO APPOINT OF AN APPALLING ABSENT.

27:45 HE'S WORKED AT BOEING FOR 10 YEARS.

27:47 HE OBVIOUSLY WAS COMMITTED TO THIS COMPANY.

27:51 TO COME OUT AND OUTLINED EVERYTHING GOING WRONG, HE'S

27:53 CLEARLY CONCERNED. IT FEELS LIKE THIS GRILLING

27:57 WILL BE MORE BAD NEWS FOR BOEING. JONATHAN:

27:59 NUMBERS FROM DELTA. LISA: THIS IS CONNECTED TO BOEING.

28:06 IT RAISES THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THEY CAN DELIVER PLANES

28:07 THAT ARE VERY MUCH IN DEMAND. THE DEMAND IS VERY MUCH THERE.

28:11 DELTA BEATING EXPECTATIONS. EXPECTING QUARTER PROFIT AND

28:16 REVENUE TO EXCEED EXPECTATIONS EVEN MORE.

28:19 GIVING YOU THIS FROM ED BASTIAN, THE CEO.

28:24 DELTA EXPRESSED -- EXPECTS NO LET UP IN DEMAND.

28:30 THE PEAKS LOOK QUITE STRONG. THIS GOES TO THE QUESTION OF

28:34 CONSUMER SPENDING, OF WHETHER THE CONSUMER IS STRONG.

28:37 THIS IS CLASSIC DISCRETIONARY SPENDING AND THEY ARE SPENDING

28:38 IT. THIS IS WHY I HAVE BEEN SO INTERESTED ABOUT DELTA.

28:44 EVEN WITH ALL THE HANG UPS AND FUEL PRICES GOING HIGHER THEY

28:47 ARE ABLE TO PASS IT ALONG AND STILL HAS THE STEADY DEMAND.

28:49 JONATHAN: THE STOCK IS POSITIVE IN THE

28:52 PREMARKET BY SOMETHING LIKE 2.9%. I WANT TO TURN TO APPLE

28:56 CONTINUALLY SHIFTING AWAY FROM CHINA.

29:01 THEY ARE DOUBLING THE OUTPUT IN INDIA.

29:04 ONE IN SEVEN IPHONES WILL BE MADE IN INDIA, TOTALING $14

29:06 BILLION. CHINA REMAINS APPLE'S LARGEST

29:10 OVERSEEN MARKET. YOU CAN SEE QUITE CLEARLY THEY

29:15 ARE DIVERSIFYING BIG TIME. YOU SEE IT IN THE NUMBERS. LISA:

29:21 YOU SAW SOMETHING LIKE 14% NOW OF IPHONES PRODUCED IN INDIA,

29:24 IT GOES TO THIS QUESTION ARE THEY SAYING ONE THING AND DOING

29:25 SOMETHING ELSE? SAYING THEY ARE COMMITTED TO

29:29 CHINA, THEY WANT TO REMAIN THERE PLAYING THE ULTIMATE

29:30 DIPLOMAT. TIM COOK HAS BEEN THAT PERSON.

29:35 ON THE OTHER SIDE JUST PRODUCE THIS. ANNMARIE:

29:40 HE'S OFF THE TRIP HE WASN'T CHINA SAYING THEY ARE COMMITTED

29:41 TO THE COMPANY. THAT 14% IS ONE IN SEVEN.

29:47 THIS IS THE WHOLE IDEA OF FRIENDSHORN.

29:50 WHERE WILL IT BE TENURES ON THE LINE?

29:55 A LOT OF GEOPOLITICS CLOUD THE STORY. JONATHAN:

30:02 CALLING FOR THE FIGURE TO RISE 3.7% YEAR-OVER-YEAR, THE

30:03 SMALLEST GAIN SINCE APRIL OF 2021.

30:06 FRANCES DONALD EXPECTING THIS. WE EXPECT RISING PRICES TO KEEP

30:11 HEADLINES CPI ELEVATED EVEN ESCORT INFLATION SLOWLY

30:12 MODERATES. WE SEE HEADLINE INFLATION

30:18 HOVERING AROUND 3% THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, LOW ENOUGH FOR THE

30:19 FED TO BEGIN CUTTING INTEREST RATES.

30:22 FRANCES IS WITH US HERE TO ASK MY NET. LET'S GET TO THAT.

30:26 WE STABILIZED AT 3% BUT THEY CAN CUT INTEREST RATES.

30:29 CAN YOU HELP US UNDERSTAND THAT MORE? FRANCES:

30:31 IT GOES BACK TO WHAT THE FED SAID TO US.

30:36 THEY ARE TRYING TO LAND THIS ECONOMY, A SOFT LANDING.

30:41 3% BY STANDARD TAYLOR RULES AND MOST OF THE WAY THE FED LOOKS

30:43 AT INFLATION IS ENOUGH TO WANT TO KEEP THOSE REAL RATES FROM

30:45 CLIMBING. WHAT I MORE INTERESTED IN IS

30:50 NOT HAVE ANY CUTS WE ARE GOING TO GET IN 2024 BUT WITH THE

30:54 TOTALITY OF THE EASING CYCLE IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE.

30:58 FOR MOST INVESTORS WHETHER THE FED STARTS IN JUNE OR

31:02 SEPTEMBER, EVEN IF THEY CUT THIS YEAR, IT WILL NOT BE AS

31:04 RELEVANT AS WHETHER WE ARE IN A SOFT LANDING.

31:10 IT WILL BE THREE TO FIVE BECAUSE TOTAL PENANCE IT'S A

31:11 MORE STANDARD CYCLE. I'M IN THE LATTER CAMP.

31:15 FOR MOST INVESTORS THAT IS FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAN SOME OF THE

31:17 DECIMAL PLACES WE WILL SEE TODAY ON CPI. JONATHAN:

31:20 YOU HAVE SAID IT REPEATEDLY. YOU DON'T GET TO HAVE YOUR CAKE

31:23 AND EAT IT TOO. IF YOU ARE IN THE OTHER CAMP,

31:29 WHAT IS A STANDARD EASING CYCLE? IT'S BEEN A WHILE. FRANCES:

31:34 WE SEE THE FED HEADING BACK TOWARDS WHAT THEY WILL CONSIDER

31:35 NEUTRAL. WE HAVE RAISED THE ESTIMATE

31:42 FROM 2% TO 3%. THIS IS A CENTRAL BANK THAT

31:43 WILL CUT HUNDREDS OF BASIS POINTS IF WE ENTER RECESSION.

31:46 THAT IS NOT WHAT IS PRICED IN THIS STORY.

31:50 THAT IS WHITE EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT THE INFLATION

31:52 NUMBER BEING SO RELEVANT BUT MY EYES ARE ON THE LABOR MARKET

31:53 AND WHAT IS STARTING TO CRACK. REHIRING ACTIVITY COMING DOWN,

31:58 WAGE GROWTH DECELERATING AND SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WITH

31:59 CONSUMERS. CREDIT CARD THE LINK ONCE HE

32:01 STARTING TO RISE. INTEREST RATE SENSITIVE POCKETS

32:07 OF RETAIL SALES LIKE HOUSING, ELECTRONICS, FURNITURE, THOSE

32:08 ARE DECLINING OVER THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF.

32:11 THAT IS EVIDENCE OF THE ECONOMY REALLY STARTING TO DETERIORATE.

32:16 ECONOMIES DON'T BREAK IN STRAIGHT LINES OR BREAK SLOWLY.

32:20 THE LABOR MARKET STARTS TO GO, IT'S A NONLINEAR FASHION.

32:22 THAT'S THE ONE I'M CURRENTLY WATCHING. LISA:

32:28 WHY IF THERE IS A BREAK THAT IT MEANS INFLATION WILL COME BACK

32:30 FAR ENOUGH FOR THE FED TO BE JUSTIFIED TO CUT BY HUNDREDS OF

32:31 BASIS POINTS? THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE KEY

32:37 QUESTIONS GIVEN COMMODITY PRICES, GIVEN RE-SHORING, THE

32:38 POTENTIAL FOR THINGS LIKE TARIFFS. FRANCES: IT DOESN'T.

32:43 THAT'S THE BIG CHALLENGE. THE CENTRAL BANK WILL PROBABLY

32:49 HAVE TO MAKE CRITICAL CONCESSIONS AND RECOGNIZE THEY

32:51 ARE NOW AT THE POINT IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS WHERE THE

32:54 WEIGHT OF THE DUAL MANDATE WILL START TO BECOME HEAVIER.

32:58 WHILE WE HAVE ALWAYS SAID THIS WAS A GREAT THING FOR THE FED

33:01 TO HAVE A DUAL MANDATE, FULL EMPLOYMENT, PRICE STABILITY, A

33:04 LOT OF OTHER CENTRAL BANKS WILL NOT BE IN THAT POSITION.

33:07 WAGE GROWTH IS COMING DOWN. THE DEMAND SIDE WILL PROBABLY

33:10 BRING INFLATION BACK DOWN. WE ARE NOT HEADING BACK TO SOME

33:13 2% INFLATION. THE FED WILL HAVE TO CHOOSE.

33:18 IF THEY HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SUDDENLY OUT OF WORK DO

33:21 THEY PRIORITIZE THAT OVER THE 2% TARGET AND WHATEVER THAT

33:23 MEANS? SOME OF THAT IS SUBJECTIVE CALL.

33:32 ECONOMICS IS PART ART AND PART SCIENCE.

33:35 THE ART COMPONENT AND THE INTERPRETATION OF HOW THE FED

33:38 WILL RESPOND TO THE DUAL MANDATE WILL CREATE AN ALREADY

33:42 -- AND ALREADY IS A HUGE DISPERSION AND FEDERAL RESERVE

33:43 RATE FORECASTS. LISA: IT LOOKS LIKE A RORSCHACH TEST.

33:48 YOU CAN READ WHATEVER YOU WANT IN THIS DATA.

33:52 IT HAS, CONSISTENTLY SHOWING BOTH STRENGTH IN CERTAIN PLACES

33:54 AND WEAKNESS IN PLACES YOU MENTIONED.

33:55 WE HEARD FROM MOHAMED EL-ERIAN. LISTEN TO WHAT THE COMPANIES

33:58 ARE SAYING. THIS WAS RECENTLY OUT OF DELTA.

34:02 IT EXPECTS NO LET UP IN DEMAND. USUALLY THERE IS A LULL AHEAD

34:06 OF THE SUMMER SEASON. THEY SEE NOTHING OF THE SORT.

34:12 THEY SEE STRONG TRAVEL BOOKINGS AND PEOPLE PAYING HIGHER PRICES.

34:15 HOW DO YOU PAIR THAT MESSAGE WITH ON THE MARGINS THE IDEA OF

34:18 DELAY QUINCY'S PICKING UP AND SMALL BUSINESSES EXPRESSING

34:19 CONCERN? FRANCES: THE U.S. ECONOMY IS INCREDIBLY DECENT

34:23 FOR NIGHT, MUCH MORE -- DESYNCHRONIZED, MUCH MORE THAN

34:28 WE HAVE SEEN ON MY CAREER. CEO CONFIDENCE AT BIG COMPANIES

34:34 IS LOOKING VERY STRONG. THAT'S A RE-ACCELERATION PHASE.

34:41 LOOK YESTERDAY AT SMALL BUSINESS OPTIMISM OR PESSIMISM.

34:48 THE GOODS ECONOMY IS DEFLATING. LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS AND

34:53 CONSUMERS ARE INCREDIBLY PESSIMISTIC. WHY?

34:55 THEY ARE BORROWERS. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO RELY

35:00 ON THE INTEREST RATES TO HELP THEM. HIGH INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ARE

35:06 BENEFITING FROM THE STOCK MARKET ARE DOING REALLY WELL.

35:08 IT IS NOT SO MUCH THAT ONE VIEW IS RIGHT OR

35:17 WRONG. IS THAT THIS ECONOMY IS NOT

35:20 OPERATING HOLISTICALLY. THE BEST THING IS THAT THE

35:24 CHERRY PICK BUT LOOK OF THE HOLISTIC VIEW.

35:27 MY PERSONAL VIEW IS ONCE THE LABOR MARKET STARTS TO

35:29 DETERIORATE IT WILL NOT MATTER WHERE YOU ARE, WHETHER YOU ARE

35:32 THE CEO OF A MAJOR COMPANY ARE

35:35 RUNNING A BODEGA, YOU WILL BE RECESSIONARY.

35:39 WE ARE IN AN AIR POCKET WITH IS

35:44 A MAJOR DETHINK IN HIS ASIAN --DESYNCHRONIZATION. LISA:

35:50 WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS DESYNCHRONIZATION, HOW BIG IS

35:52 THE GAP BETWEEN HIGHER AND LOWER INCOME CONSUMERS? FRANCES:

35:55 IT IS SIZABLE. THE TOP 20% OF AMERICANS SPENT

36:00 35% OF TOTAL EXPENDITURE. THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY

36:05 IF THEY ARE BENEFITING THE AGGREGATE ECONOMY IS DOING WELL.

36:11 WHEN WE LOOK AT THINGS LIKE GDP, WE'VE HAD THESE

36:14 DISCUSSIONS ON MY TEAM, IT'S POSSIBLE WE DON'T EXPECT --

36:19 EXPERIENCE OF GDP RECESSION BECAUSE HIGH INCOME CONSUMERS

36:20 HOLD UP THE NUMBER BUT THEY ARE POCKETS THAT FEEL RECESSIONARY.

36:23 POLICYMAKERS HAVE TO BE VERY SENSITIVE TO THAT.

36:28 NOT EVERYONE'S REALITY WILL BE THE SAME.

36:30 THIS IS GOING TO BE LIKE DOWNTOWN VERSUS RURAL.

36:33 CALIFORNIA VERSUS NEW YORK. WE WILL SEE A REALLY WIDE

36:38 DIVERGENCE AND ECONOMIC OUTCOMES ACROSS THIS COUNTRY BY

36:40 INCOMES, GEOGRAPHIES, AND SECTORS. JONATHAN:

36:43 SMALL VERSUS LARGE. TERRIBLE OF THE LAST 24 HOURS.

36:47 FRANCES DONALD. COMPARE WHAT WE ARE HEARING

36:51 FROM DELTA.

36:58 THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF DELTA EXPECTING NO LET UP IN DEMAND.

37:05 THE NUMBERS MOMENT AGO SAYING ADJUSTED.

37:09 DELTA APPLY CLOSE TO 5%. THIS HAS GIVEN A LIFT TO

37:11 AMERICAN AND UNITED. LISA: THERE ARE TALKS ABOUT THE

37:15 INCREASE IN REVENUES WITH HIGHER COMMODITY PRICES.

37:18 THAT'S ABOUT A THIRD OF THE COST OF THE AIRPLANE INDUSTRY.

37:22 IT DOES COME FROM OIL PRICES. THE FACT YOU STILL HAVE THE

37:26 ABILITY TO PASS IT ALONG SPEAKS TO WHAT WE HEARD FROM FRANCES.

37:28 OK. SCREAMING, RIPROARING REACCELERATION IN THE TRAVEL

37:34 INDUSTRY WITH DISCRETIONARY SPENDING.

37:37 YOU LOOK AT SMALL BUSINESSES, OTHER POCKETS, IT IS COMPLETELY

37:43 DE SYNCHRONIZED -- DESYNCHRONIZED. JONATHAN:

37:46 OPTIMISM FELT OF THE LOWS WE HAVE SEEN AT 11 YEARS.

37:48 DECADE LOWS. YOU PAIR EMPLOYMENT INTENTIONS,

37:52 THEY WERE KICKED LOWER AS WELL. COMPARE THAT FROM DELTA.

37:58 TWO VERY DIFFERENT WORLD. -- WORLDS.

38:04 LISA: WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SMALL BUSINESSES.

38:09 COMPLETELY BIFURCATED. IF YOU ARE THE FED AND LOOKING

38:10 AT THIS, WHO DO YOU CATER TO? THE REACCELERATION STORIES FROM

38:14 THE BIG COMPANIES OR SOME OF THE SMALLER BUSINESSES AND

38:18 REGIONS THAT ARE GETTING HARDER HIT AND SAY YOU GUYS NEED A

38:22 REPRIEVE? IT IS A TOUGH CALL. JONATHAN: DELTA UP BY 4.5%.

38:26 LET'S GET AN UPDATE ON STORIES ELSEWHERE WITH DANI BURGER.

38:30 DANI: RAPHAEL BOSTIC SEES ONE RATE

38:36 CUT THIS YEAR BUT IS OPEN TO CHANGING HIS MIND IF ECONOMIC

38:39 CONDITIONS CHANGE. THE U.S. ECONOMY CONTINUES TO SHOW

38:44 RESILIENCE BUT HE DOES NOT DISCOUNT THE POSSIBILITY RATES

38:46 HAVE TO MOVE FURTHER OUT BUT LEAVING HIMSELF OPTIONALITY.

38:49 HE ADDED LABOR MARKET CHANGE WOULD NEED CUTTING SOONER.

38:54 TSMC'S QUARTERLY REVENUE GREW AT ITS FASTEST PACE IN OVER A

38:56 YEAR THANKS TO THE AI BOOM. THEIR VALUE DOUBLED SINCE

38:59 OCTOBER OF 2022. IT'S OUTPERFORMANCE ALSO HELPED

39:05 ENHANCE EXPECTATIONS THAT IT WILL RETURN TO SOLID GROWTH

39:06 THIS YEAR AFTER SLOWER THAN EXPECTED POST-COVID RECOVERY.

39:11 THEY SAID IN JANUARY THE AI REVENUE IS GROWING AT A 50%

39:14 ANNUAL PACE. TSMC IS THE CHIPMAKER FOR APPLE

39:18 AND NVIDIA. BYTEDANCE'S REVENUE IS SURGING.

39:25 THE OWNER OF TIKTOK SAID THE REVENUE SOARED 60% IN 2023, THE

39:30 FIRST TIME IT'S OUTPACED TENCENT AND ALIBABA.

39:33 THE COMPANY FACES AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE IN THE U.S..

39:36 THE HOUSE PASSED A BILL LAST MONTH TO BAN TIKTOK UNLESS

39:40 BYTEDANCE SELLS ITS PRIZED ASSETS.

39:41 THAT IS YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF. JONATHAN:

39:43 SOME STUNNING NUMBERS THERE. UP NEXT, BOEING'S DEEPENING

39:47 CRISIS.

39:51 >> WE WILL APPROACH THIS ACKNOWLEDGING OUR MISTAKE.

39:55 >> WE DON'T PUT AIRPLANES IN THE AIR WE DON'T HAVE ONE

39:57 HUNDRED PERCENT CONFIDENCE IN. JONATHAN: THAT STORY IS UP NEXT.

40:12 JONATHAN: THIS IS THE VERY DEFINITION OF

40:13 SNOOZING. EQUITIES GOING NOWHERE.

40:17 EURO-DOLLAR GOING NOWHERE. THE BOND MARKET GOING NOWHERE.

40:23 CHECK BACK IN AT 8:30 EASTERN TIME.

40:26 I IMAGINE WE WILL GET CPI AND WE WILL START GOING SOMEWHERE.

40:30 LISA: LITERALLY RIGHT NOW PEOPLE ARE

40:32 JUST SITTING ON THEIR HANDS. THE BETS ARE IN.

40:34 QA FOR THE CASINO TO OPEN. LET'S GO. JONATHAN:

40:40 UNDER SURVEILLANCE THIS MORNING BOEING'S DEEPENING CRISIS.

40:45 >> I HAVE KIDS, GRANDKIDS, AND SO DO YOU. THIS STUFF MATTERS.

40:51 WE WILL APPROACH THIS NUMBER ONE ACKNOWLEDGING OUR MISTAKE.

40:55 >> WE DON'T PUT AIRPLANES IN THE AIR WE DON'T HAVE A 100%

40:56 CONFIDENCE IN. JONATHAN: BOEING'S 787 UNDER SCRUTINY.

41:04 AN ENGINEER CLAIMING THEY TOOK SHORTCUTS TO SPEED ASSEMBLY OF

41:07 THE AIRCRAFT AND THE ISSUES DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE LIFE OF

41:08 THE PLANE. BOEING CALLING THE ACCUSATIONS

41:11 INACCURATE. GEORGE FERGUSON JOINS US FOR

41:14 MORE. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE ALLEGATIONS AND HOW SERIOUS

41:18 THEY ARE? GEORGE: GOOD MORNING. THEY ARE JUST EMERGING.

41:25 WE ARE JUST GETTING OUR ARMS AROUND IT.

41:29 THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THE FUSELAGE OF THE 787.

41:34 PREVIOUSLY WE HAD GOING DISCLOSE AND WORK WITH THE FAA

41:38 TO FIX SHIMMING PROBLEMS THEY WERE HAVING.

41:42 THE BEGINNING OF THIS I'M WONDERING IF THIS IS PART OF

41:44 THAT SAME PROBLEM. WHAT I WILL SAY IS THE 787 IS

41:48 AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AIRPLANE TO BOEING.

41:52 SECOND MOST IMPORTANT AFTER THE 737 THIS IS AN AIRPLANE THEY

41:58 HAVE COLLECTED A LOT OF ORDERS FURTHER LATELY.

42:02 THEY AT AIRBUS ARE IN THE MARKET PRETTY HARD RIGHT NOW.

42:07 THEY ARE THE SMALLER WIDE-BODIES.

42:10 IF THEY CAN PUSH THESE PROGRAMS UP TO HIGHER BUILD RATES, THAT

42:14 WOULD BE A TAILWIND FOR PROFITS FOR CASH FLOW.

42:17 AS THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT AIRPLANE TO BOEING, VERY

42:20 IMPORTANT, VERY CONCERNING. I'M WONDERING IF THIS IS

42:25 SOMETHING WE HAVE ALREADY VISITED AND THAT IS WHY THE FAA

42:27 IS JUMPING QUICKLY TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER THIS IS PART OF

42:30 THAT SHIM PROBLEM BOEING HAD PREVIOUSLY. JONATHAN:

42:34 FACTORY WORKERS WRONGLY MEASURED AND FILLED GAPS WHEN

42:36 THEY ARE JOINED TOGETHER. THE PROCESS CAN CREATE

42:43 SIGNIFICANT FATIGUE AND THE COMPOSITE MATERIAL AND IMPAIR

42:46 THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF 1000 WIDE-BODY JETS AND SERVICE.

42:49 IF YOU ARE WAKING UP AND SAW THIS PLAN GOING YESTERDAY

42:53 AFTERNOON AND YOU'RE AN AIRLINE WITH SOME OF THESE PLANES AND

42:55 SERVICE, HOW DO YOU REACT THIS MORNING? GEORGE:

42:59 VERY CONCERNING. WHAT I'M HEARING AND WHAT HAS

43:04 BEEN RELEASED SO FAR IS ACHING IN EFFECT LONGEVITY DOWN THE

43:05 LINE. OPERATIONS ARE NOT AFFECTED.

43:10 DO YOU DRIVE ON BUT YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT AN ASSET YOU

43:15 PROBABLY PAID $130 MILLION FOR. YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

43:19 LONG-TERM ABILITY TO USE THE AIRPLANE.

43:23 YOU HAVE ANOTHER BOEING QUALITY PROBLEM POTENTIALLY ON YOUR

43:26 HANDS. YOU WOULD HATE TO HAVE THAT BUT

43:29 IT COULD HAPPEN. LISA: IT RAISES THE QUESTION ABOUT

43:32 NEW ARTISTS -- ORDERS WHEN DEMAND IS GOING TO THE ROOF.

43:36 DELTA EXPECTATIONS BEAT WALL STREET'S FORECASTS.

43:39 THEY TALK ABOUT SECOND-QUARTER COMING IN ROBUST AND NO SIGN OF

43:40 SLOWDOWN. TYPICAL FOR THIS TYPE OF SEASON.

43:44 HOW MUCH CAN WE INSPECT AIRPLANE TICKETS TO GO UP AND

43:47 PRICES TO GO UP SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF DELIVERIES OF

43:51 NEW PLANES, LACK OF CAPACITY, AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF DEMAND?

43:54 GEORGE: THERE'S A DEBATE IN THE MARKET

43:55 PLACE RIGHT NOW. IF THERE IS A LACK OF

44:01 AIRPLANES, IF THAT WILL FILTER THROUGH INTO THE MARKETPLACE.

44:05 FOR SURE DELTA WOULD GAIN FROM THE PROBLEMS THAT BOEING.

44:10 YOU ARE NOT GETTING AIRPLANES AS FAST AS YOU WOULD LIKE AND

44:12 YOU CANNOT COMPETE AS MUCH WITH THEM. IT COULD HELP THEM.

44:17 WHAT I WILL SAY, DELTA'S EARNINGS WERE NICE.

44:21 IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR YIELDS IT IS THE PRICE PAID FOR MILE

44:24 FLOWN BY PASSENGER, THE YIELDS WERE DOWN YEAR-OVER-YEAR.

44:31 IF YOU LOOK AT THE BIFURCATION OF THAT, IF YOU LOOK AT THE

44:38 BASIC ECONOMY CUSTOMER, THE INCOME FROM THEM GREW 4%

44:43 AGAINST CAPACITY THAT GROUP -- NOT CAPACITY BUT AGAINST TRAVEL

44:53 THAT GREW 9%, PASSENGER MILES, ALL THE MILES THAT REFILLED.

44:56 THAT GREW 4% FOR THE BASIC TRAVELER.

44:58 IT GREW 10% FOR THE PREMIUM TRAVELER.

45:01 WHAT I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU IS, IT LOOKS LIKE THE BASIC

45:05 TRAVELER THAT MIGHT BE TOO MANY SEATS IN THE MARKETPLACE, IF

45:11 YOU LOOK AT DELTA'S DOMESTIC YIELDS, PRICE PAID FOR MILE

45:12 FLOWN BY TRAVELER, THOSE WERE FLAT.

45:19 WE ARE NOT SEEING FARES RISE SIGNIFICANTLY.

45:22 IN DECEMBER THEY GUIDED FORWARD. THE GUIDE WAS AN OPERATING

45:27 MARGIN BELOW LAST YEAR'S OPERATING MARGINS.

45:29 WHILE THE PROPHET LOOKED GOOD AND BEAT EXPECTATIONS, I'M

45:34 SEEING HIGHER LOAD FACTORS OF DELTA AND MAYBE FARES FOR THE

45:37 BASIC TRAVELER ARE NOT AS GOOD.

45:43 THEY ARE FLAT-ISH AND BETTER FOR THE PREMIUM TRAVELER. LISA:

45:46 THIS IS FASCINATING CONSIDERING WHAT FRANCES DONALD SAID.

45:51 THERE IS NO BETTER MICROCOSM THAN AIRLINES AND FLYING.

45:55 SOME PEOPLE ARE PUT IN THE BACK AND THEY HAVE TO BOARD LASTED

45:58 YOU DON'T HAVE ROOM TO PUT YOUR BAGS, THEN PEOPLE LOOK FOR AND

45:59 GET INCREDIBLE MEALS AND HAVE GREAT SPACE. YOU PAY UP FOR IT.

46:04 ARE YOU SAYING PEOPLE IN THE BACK ARE ACTUALLY BECOMING MUCH

46:07 MORE PRICE-SENSITIVE AND ARE HAVING A HARDER TIME JUSTIFYING

46:09 HIGH COSTS AND SEEING LESS REVENUE?

46:11 THE PEOPLE IN THE FRONT ARE DOING FINE AND THAT IS WHAT YOU

46:13 ARE SEEING. A LOT OF HAIR LENTIL COUNT ON

46:16 THE PEOPLE IN THE FRONT MORE. GEORGE:

46:18 THAT IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TO ME.

46:21 THIS BODES WELL FOR UNITED AND AMERICAN.

46:25 IF YOU HAVE PREMIUM SEATS, YOU CAN SELL THEM AT GOOD TICKET

46:26 PRICES. THOSE FOLKS ARE WILLING TO PAY

46:29 FOR COMFORT. IF YOU HAVE ECONOMY SEATS, IT

46:33 WILL BE MUCH MORE CHALLENGING. A LOT MORE PRICE SENSITIVITY.

46:39 IT GOES TO THAT TWO SPEED ECONOMY. ANNMARIE:

46:42 IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY ARE OPERATING IN A MORE EFFICIENT

46:43 WAY AND NOT GROWING. HOW DOES DELTA GROW FROM HERE?

46:48 TO THEY OFFER MORE PREMIUM FOR THE HIGH-END CONSUMERS? GEORGE:

46:52 WE ARE SEEING THAT ACROSS THE INDUSTRY.

46:56 IF YOU CAN PUT PREMIUM IN AN AIRPLANE, SOME OF THE ULTRA LOW

47:01 COST CARRIERS ARE OFFERING TAKING THE MIDDLE SEAT AND

47:04 BLOCKING IT OUT TO CREATE MORE PREMIUM AT A HIGHER PRICE POINT

47:07 FOR THE SEATS. THAT IS ONE OF THE WAYS YOU CAN

47:09 GIVE PREMIUM IN. IF YOU LOOK AT DELTA LOAD

47:14 FACTORS, THEY WERE NICE DURING THE QUARTER. 83%.

47:19 THE AIRLINES ARE PUSHING GETTING THE AIRPLANE AS FULL AS

47:20 POSSIBLE. IF YOU ARE NOT GETTING THE

47:23 EXACT TICKET PRICE YOU WOULD LIKE, IF IT'S SOFTER, MAKE SURE

47:27 YOU FILL THE AIRPLANE MORE LIKELY HAVE SEEN WILL BE TRAVEL.

47:31 AIRPLANES SEEM TO BE FULL EVERY TIME WE PULL AWAY FROM THE GATE.

47:35 THAT'S ANOTHER STRATEGY FOR IMPROVING REVENUE AND IMPROVING

47:37 PROFITABILITY. YOU ARE PUTTING CLOSE TO THE

47:40 SAME COSTS AGAINST THE HIGHER REVENUE BASE FOR THE WHOLE

47:44 PLANE. JONATHAN: THE PRE-UPDATE. GEORGE FERGUSON OF BLOOMBERG

47:47 INTELLIGENCE. DELTA UP BY ALMOST 5%.

47:53 NOBODY ON THE PLANE GETS A GOOD MEAL. NO ONE ON THE PLANE. LISA:

48:00 RELATIVELY SPEAKING, YOU SIT IN THE BACK WITH A BAG OF

48:02 CHEEZE-ITS. JONATHAN: I RATHER HAVE THOSE THAN THE

48:07 SLOP THEY SERVE AT THE FRONT OF THE PLANE. JETBLUE, GREAT FOOD.

48:12 AND AIR ITALIA. LISA: I SEE SOME OF THE VERY SMALL

48:16 VIOLIN OVER THERE. JONATHAN: JUST IN CASE ANYONE IS FLYING

48:21 BUSINESS AND THEY ARE INTERESTED, WHAT WE HEARD WAS

48:22 REALLY CRITICAL. YOU CAN EXTEND THAT TO THE

48:26 ECONOMY. FLYING IN THE FRONT AND FLYING

48:29 IN THE BACK ARE TWO DIFFERENT WORLDS. LISA:

48:32 IT IS BASICALLY A TIERED ECONOMY FOR EVERYONE TO SEE.

48:35 IF YOU'RE SPECIAL PRIVILEGE, COME ON IN.

48:38 IF NOT, YOU GOTTA CHECK THAT BAG.

48:40 YOU DON'T HAVE ROOM FOR THAT BAG. YOUR KIDS -- EH.

48:45 THEY HAVE VERY DIFFERENT REALITIES FINANCIALLY. JONATHAN:

48:48 THIS IS A TREND, THE PUSH TOWARDS PREMIUM AND HIGHER

48:49 MARGINS. LISA: IS THE Y INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL

48:53 HAS BEEN MORE THE GREETED. THE CARRIERS THAT ARE LISTED

48:56 MYSTIC AND MORE INTERNATIONAL HAVE DONE BETTER.

49:01 INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THE BIFURCATED ECONOMY IS PLAYING

49:03 OUT IN REAL TIME IN THE EARNINGS AND HOW THEY ADJUST.

49:06 JONATHAN: DELTA DOING BETTER THAN GOOD.

49:12 COMING UP NEXT, AMY WU SILVERMAN , MANDEEP SINGH ALONGSIDE TOM

49:16 TZITZOURIS. THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

49:23 ♪

49:40 >> THIS MOVE AND COMMODITIES HAS BEEN YEARS IN THE MAKING.

49:43 >> THE MOVIE GOT AN OIL WAS TELLING FROM AN INFLATION

49:48 PERSPECTIVE.

49:49 >> THAT WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH CERTAIN KINDS OF COMMODITY

49:51 PRICES, SPECIFICALLY ON COPPER.

49:54 >> WE UPDATED OUR VIEW ON GOLD. THERE IS NOW TO A RISK ON

49:57 INFLATION.

50:01 >> THE WORLD IS CHANGING AND AWAY THE MARKETS ARE NOT

50:02 LOOKING AT. ANNOUNCER: THIS IS "BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE"

50:08 WITH JONATHAN FERRO, LISA ABRAMOWICZ AND ANNMARIE HORDERN.

50:12 JONATHAN: INFLATION DATA 90 MINUTES AWAY.

50:14 GOOD MORNING, GOOD MORNING. THE SECOND HOUR OF "BLOOMBERG

50:17 SURVEILLANCE" BEGINS NOW. S&P 500 BARELY POSITIVE.

50:24 A READ ON U.S. INFLATION. HOW STRONG IS THE U.S. ECONOMY?

50:28 THIS IS FROM ED BASTIAN OF DELTA SPEAKING TO BLOOMBERG.

50:31 EXPECTING NO LET UP IN DEMAND. LISA:

50:34 THIS STEMS FROM WHAT WE HEARD FROM GEORGE FERGUSON.

50:39 IT IS SUCH A BIFURCATED ECONOMY AND SOMEBODY DIFFERENT WAYS.

50:40 SPLINTERED IN TERMS OF WHO HAS MONEY AND WHO WAS SPENDING AND

50:43 WHO DOESN'T. WHAT DOES THE FED PAY ATTENTION

50:46 TO? IS CPI GOING TO CALL THEIR HAND

50:49 WHEN THEY LOOK AT THE WEAKNESS WE ARE SEEING IN SMALL

50:52 BUSINESSES WITH CONSUMER TO LINCOLN SEES AND THE OTHER

50:55 METRICS PEOPLE ARE POINTING TO? JONATHAN:

50:57 DELTA AIRLINES IS MAKING MONEY.

51:06 THE ESTIMATE IS 223. ANNMARIE: IT'S PEOPLE SITTING IN THE

51:09 FRONT VERSUS PEOPLE IN THE BACK. I GO BACK TO THE SMALL BUSINESS

51:12 SURVEY. A CHIEF ECONOMIST SAID INFLATION ONCE AGAIN TOP OF THE

51:17 ISSUE TO MAINSTREAM BUSINESSES. THAT GOES INTO THE CPI REPORT

51:19 TODAY. LISA: THIS RAISES THE QUESTION ABOUT

51:25 WHETHER INFLATION WILL CALL THE FED'S HAND.

51:27 POCKETS OF STRENGTH AND POCKETS OF WEAKNESS.

51:30 ARE THEY GOING TO BE PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO THE INFLATION

51:34 SIDE OF THE MANDATE, OR IS THE PRIORITY ON THE STRENGTH OF THE

51:36 ECONOMY AND THE IDEA OF EMPLOYMENT REMAINING RESILIENT

51:37 FOR LONGER? THAT IS WHAT THE MARKET IS

51:39 GRAPPLING WITH. IT SEEMS LIKE THEY THINK IT IS

51:44 A FED THAT'S MORE HEAVILY WEIGHTED TO THE EMPLOYMENT.

51:48 JONATHAN: STEVE HAS BEEN SANGHA PEDLEY

51:53 THE FEDERAL -- STEVE HAS SAID REPEATEDLY THE FED WILL WANT TO

51:54 CUT. HOW LONG BEFORE YOU STOP CALLING THEM BUMPS IN THE ROAD?

51:59 LISA: I LOVE THAT COMMENT. IS BUMP THE NEW TRANSITORY INSE

52:07 TERMS OF FOR A FAILED CONCEPT. THEY ARE SET UP FOR THE IDEA OF

52:11 INFLATION RUNNING HARDER. WHAT IS THE BIGGEST SURPRISE TO

52:14 THE MARKET? WHAT IS THE POTENTIAL BIGGER

52:16 REACTION? IF THERE IS AN UPSIDE SURPRISE

52:19 OR DOWNSIDE SURPRISE? I THINK IT IS A DOWNSIDE

52:22 SURPRISE. EVERYONE WILL SAY THIS IS

52:25 GUINNESS USE FOR THE FED TO GO. THAT'S AMAZING.

52:29 THIS IS THE ALL CLEAR TO THEM, EVEN IF INFLATION IS RUNNING

52:32 HARDER THAN EXPECTED. THAT IS THE BALANCE TO RISK, TO

52:36 RALLY FURTHER. JONATHAN: WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HOW

52:40 SHORT THINGS ARE IN TREASURIES AT THE MOMENT.

52:43 IF YOU WANT THE ESTIMATE, WE CAN PUT THEM ON THE SCREEN.

52:46 0.3%. THE MEDIAN ESTIMATE WAS 0.4%.

52:54 EQUITY SCORES LOOK LIKE THIS ON THE S&P 500. FUTURES POSITIVE.

52:59 ON MONDAY, WE WERE DOWN A LITTLE BIT AND THEN UP A LITTLE

53:01 ON TUESDAY AND THAT UP A LITTLE ON WEDNESDAY.

53:04 REALLY MUTED PRICE ACTION GOING INTO THIS INFLATION DATA.

53:08 TEN-YEAR, 435.57. YIELDS GOING NOWHERE.

53:12 THE EURO UNCHANGED AGAINST THE DOLLAR.

53:16 COMING UP THIS HOUR TO DISCUSS, AMY WU SILVERMAN ON WHY THE

53:19 LEFT TAIL IS WAKING UP. MANDEEP SINGH WITH A BYTEDANCE

53:22 REPORT. TOM TZITZOURIS ON WHAT WASHINGTON AND THE FED ARE

53:27 ALIGNED ON. THAT'S A CONVERSATION YOU DO

53:29 NOT WANT TO MISS. WE BEGIN WITH STOCKS HOLDING

53:32 STEADY IN THE UNITED STATES AHEAD OF CPI DATA LATER THIS

53:37 MORNING. AMY WU SILVERMAN SAYS ENTHUSIASM IS BEGINNING TO FADE.

53:41 THE LEFT TAIL IS STARTING TO WAKE UP.

53:46 WE ARE REFERRING TO THE BED FOR DOWNSIDE -- BID FOR DOWNSIDE

53:48 PROTECTION. AMY: GOOD MORNING. JONATHAN:

53:52 HOW ARE YOU INTERPRETING THIS SHIFT?

53:55 LAST TIME WE SPOKE IT WAS A DIFFERENT STORY. AMY:

53:58 MIGHT I ADD IT WAS ACTUALLY THE PEAK OF ENTHUSIASM WHEN WE

54:03 LOOKED AT THE CALL DEMAND ON NVIDIA AS A PROXY FOR AI

54:04 ENTHUSIASM. WE WENT TO THE 100TH PERCENTILE

54:09 TO ABOUT 40TH PERCENTILE NOW. WHAT IT TELLS YOU IS THIS

54:14 ENTHUSIASM IS STILL THERE BUT IT'S WANED SUBSTANTIALLY.

54:19 AS YOU MENTIONED IN THE QUOTE, THE LEFT TAIL IS PICKING UP.

54:21 WE ARE SEEING THE OPTIONS MARKET SAY MAYBE THERE IS SOME

54:24 THING TO HEDGE OUT THERE. TO BE CLEAR, WE HAVE NOT SEEN

54:27 THAT SINCE 2022. JONATHAN: IS THIS ANTICIPATION OR THE

54:30 PRICE? SINCE WE LAST SPOKE, NVIDIA WAS

54:35 DOWN BY 11%. THE PRICE HAS MOVED.

54:39 WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY ARE ANTICIPATING? AMY:

54:44 SOMETIMES THE QUESTION IS, IS THIS AN INDICATOR OR SITUATION

54:47 OF THE TAIL WAGGING THE DOG? IN OTHER SITUATIONS WHERE

54:53 NVIDIA HAS SOLD OFF OR AI HAS TAKEN A PULLBACK THE ENTHUSIASM

54:55 HAS NOT WANED. TO ME WHAT IS DIFFERENT IS THE

55:00 POSITIONING HAS STAYED PRETTY STABLE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS.

55:03 THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE SEEN PRICE ACTION CHANGE AND

55:06 FOLKS SAY I WILL NOT JUMP IN THE POOL AGAIN.

55:09 TO ME THAT NUANCE IS IMPORTANT. LISA:

55:11 IS THIS BEARISH OR BULLISH? YOU CAN SAY THIS IS ON THE

55:16 MARGINS NOT THAT GREAT FOR THE HIGH FLYERS AND AI.

55:20 IF YOU'RE SEEING IT BROUGHT NOW AND PEOPLE ACTUALLY GETTING

55:21 MORE CONFIDENT IN THE REST OF THE SECTORS, IT'S OVERALL

55:23 POSITIVE. IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE SEEING?

55:27 AMY: THE PROBLEM IS THAT IS REALLY,

55:29 KATE IT. WE ARE NOT SURE. WHEN YOU SEE THE MARKET BROADEN

55:36 OUT WE EXPECT TO SEE THIS TRANSLATION TO SOMETHING LIKE

55:40 THE PROXY OF THE MARKET BROADENING OUT.

55:42 YOU PROBABLY SEE THAT CALL DEMAND TRANSFER OVER.

55:46 WE HAVE SEEN THAT A LITTLE BIT BUT ACTUALLY WHAT WE HAVE SEEN

55:48 MORE OF IS THE DOWNSIDE PICKING UP. ENTHUSIASM HAS WANED.

55:53 THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED IN THE PAST AND WE HAVE NOT SEEN THAT

55:54 TRANSFER. THAT IS WHAT I'M WATCHING FOR

55:59 IN TERMS OF THIS GOING TO CONTINUE.

56:02 THE OPTIONS MARKET IS MORE CONCERNED THAT IT'S MORE THAN A

56:03 GENERAL PULLBACK. LISA: THIS IS A HIGHLY COMPLEX TIME,

56:06 ESPECIALLY TOWARDS CPI COMING OUT IN A LITTLE LESS THAN 90

56:11 MINUTES. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MARKET IS

56:14 BETTER POSITIONED FOR? AN UPSIDE SURPRISE OR DOWNSIDE

56:19 SURPRISE? IS THE MARKET PREPARED FOR

56:24 INFLATION RUNNING TOO HOT OR COOLING RAPIDLY WITH POTENTIAL

56:25 FOR SOME WEAKER GROWTH? AMY: THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THE

56:31 MARKET IS MORE PREPARED FOR THE DOWNSIDE RATHER THAN THE

56:34 UPSIDE, IN TERMS OF THE MARKET ITSELF SELLING OFF.

56:36 LIKE A PRINT BEING HOTTER THAN EXPECTED.

56:41 WHAT I THINK IS INTERESTING IS IT IS NOT JUST THAT.

56:47 THE MARKET MAGNITUDE FROM CPI IS THE HIGHEST IT HAS BEEN.

56:51 WE MEASURE THAT THROUGH THE STRADDLE PRICING AND OPTIONS

56:52 ITSELF. THE MAGNITUDE OF THE MOVE IS

56:54 ONE OF THE LARGEST WE HAVE SEEN OUT OF ALL THE PRINTS WE HAVE

56:55 HAD. ANNMARIE: AND THE OPTIONS MARKET, PEOPLE

57:00 ARE HEDGING WITH GOLD, CORRECT? IS IT JUST INFLATION OR ARE

57:04 PEOPLE BUYING INTO THAT FOR OTHER REASONS? AMY:

57:07 ANOTHER INTERESTING PART OF THE MARKET.

57:10 WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT PRIOR TO THIS LEFT TAIL WAKING

57:14 UP ONE THING WE SAID WAS WE KNOW PEOPLE ARE WORRIED.

57:18 WHERE IS THE WORRY BEING EXPRESSED?

57:20 WE HAVE SEEN IT IN GOLD AND ENERGY DUE TO GEOPOLITICAL

57:24 RISKS. I THINK THE ASIAN BANK

57:27 NARRATIVE IS SOME OF IT BUT I DO THINK IT'S AN OUTLET FOR

57:28 EXPRESSING INFLATION CONCERNS. WHEN YOU SEE THAT HISTORIC

57:34 PICKUP AND CALL SKEW YOU ARE SAYING IF YOU OWN GOLD THE

57:37 PAYOUT IS AT A LEVEL THAT'S EXTREMELY ATTRACTIVE RELATIVE

57:38 TO HISTORY. WE CONTINUE TO SEE THAT CLIMB.

57:42 IT'S AN OUTLET THAT'S EXPRESSING IT ON THE LEFT TAIL

57:45 HAS NOT BEEN WORKING IN THE MARKET ITSELF. JONATHAN:

57:49 HOW CONSENSUS IS THE LONG ENERGY STORY BECOME?

57:54 OVERWEIGHT ENERGY, OVERWEIGHT COMMODITIES. THAT NOTE.

58:01 AMY: THIS IS A TRAIN PEOPLE HAVE GONE ON BUT IT'S HARD TO PRICE

58:08 THAT UNKNOWN COMING FROM THE GEOPOLITICAL RISK.

58:10 THIS IS SOMETHING INVESTORS STRUGGLE WITH.

58:13 LAST THURSDAY'S PRICE ACTION WAS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT.

58:18 IF WE GET INTO AN ESCALATING SITUATION WITH IRAN, HOW DO WE

58:19 PRICE THAT? HOW DO WE PRICE THE UNKNOWN

58:21 UNKNOWNS. I THINK THAT CONTINUES AND YOU

58:26 HAVE THE VALUATION ARGUMENT THAT CONTINUES TO HOLD TO,

58:30 WHICH IS WHY PEOPLE CONTINUE TO STICK WITH IT. LISA:

58:33 WE ARE SEEING -- I'M SEEING A LOT OF PEOPLE BUYING 125,

58:37 WINTER 35 CALLS ON OIL. HOW HIGH ARE PEOPLE EXPECTING

58:41 THIS PEAK IN THE SUMMER TO GET? AMY:

58:46 A GOOD ANALOGY IS I ALSO SEE PEOPLE BUYING 30, 40 STRIKES ON

58:48 VIX ITSELF. DO THEY THINK WE ARE GOING TO

58:50 GET THERE? NO. IF WE DO, THE PAYOUT IS REALLY

58:54 ATTRACTIVE. YOU GET THAT CONVEXITY

58:58 IMMEDIATELY. IF WE GET SOME SITUATION THAT

59:05 IS UNANTICIPATED, WE KNOW THE TAIL EVENTS ARE RELATIVELY IN

59:07 EXTENSIVE FOR EXTREME THE ATTRACTIVE PAYOUTS. LISA:

59:11 ONE THING I HEAR FROM YOU WAS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A SHIFT,

59:16 WHETHER WITH AI STOCKS OR WITH JUST THIS PREPARATION FOR

59:18 DOWNSIDE FROM THIS HOTTER THAN EXPECTED CPI PRINT, WHICH

59:21 PEOPLE ARE ANTICIPATING. WHAT DOES THIS TELL YOU ABOUT

59:24 INFLECTION POINTS BASED ON YOUR HISTORY WHEN YOU SEE

59:27 DERIVATIVES TRADING? AMY: I KEEP HARPING ON THIS.

59:36 THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THE DERIVATIVES MARKET HAS SAID

59:37 SOMETHING DIFFERENT WHEN WE HAVE SEEN MOMENTUM GO THIS WAY.

59:42 I THINK I WAS HERE RIGHT PRIOR TO MARCH 18 WHEN THE NVIDIA

59:43 CONFERENCE WAS. I SAID THERE WERE THESE

59:46 CLEARING EVENTS WERE EITHER MOMENTUM CONTINUES OVER AND

59:50 STOPS. WHEN WE SEE THIS SHIFT IN MOMENTUM FROM THE OPTIONS

59:56 MARKET ITSELF, THAT IS TYPICALLY A REALLY INTERESTING

59:57 LEADING INDICATOR. WE HAVE NOT GOTTEN THAT.

01:00:00 THAT IS THE ONE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NOW AND OVER A MONTH

01:00:05 AGO. JONATHAN: THOUGHTFUL STUFF. AMY WU SILVERMAN.

01:00:09 I HEARD BASICALLY ECONOMISTS ARE LOOKING FOR 0.3% BUT THE

01:00:13 MARKET IS POSITIONED FOR 0.4%. LISA:

01:00:17 ALL THE SHORTS ARE GOING TO GET SQUEEZED OUT.

01:00:20 THIS IS A UNIQUE MOMENT AS WE HEARD FROM AMY.

01:00:22 THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN RECENT MEMORY THAT THE MARKET

01:00:27 IS MORE PREPARED FOR AN UPSIDE SURPRISE THAN A DOWNSIDE

01:00:29 SURPRISE THAT COMES WITH IT FROM THE CPI PRINT RATHER THAN

01:00:31 AMY DOES. JONATHAN: WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE SAID

01:00:36 IN-LINE MIGHT BE THE NEW BEAT WHEN IT COMES TO INFLATION AND

01:00:38 THE WAY THE MARKET IS SET UP. EQUITY FUTURES POSITIVE 5.1% ON

01:00:47 THE S&P 500 --.1% ON THE S&P 500. DANI:

01:00:50 -- STABLE TO NEGATIVE. RISING ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY HAS

01:00:56 ERODED FISCAL BUFFERS. ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT DEBT IS

01:01:02 INCREASING, IT DID AFFIRM CHINA'S A-PLUS RATING.

01:01:05 SIGNS THAT APPLE IS PUSHING BEYOND CHINA.

01:01:10 BLOOMBERG REPORTED THE COMPANY ASSEMBLED $14 BILLION WORTH OF

01:01:13 IPHONES IN INDIA AND HIS LAST FISCAL YEAR, DOUBLE THE

01:01:14 PRODUCTION FROM THE YEAR PRIOR. SOURCES SAY THE TECH GIANT NOW

01:01:19 AS MUCH AS 14% OR ABOUT ONE IN SEVEN OF ITS MARQUEE DEVICES IN

01:01:21 INDIA. MORE TROUBLE FOR BOWING.

01:01:27 THE FAA IS INVESTIGATING WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINTS THAT

01:01:31 THE COMPANY TOOK SHORTCUTS TO EASE PRODUCTION BOTTLENECKS ON

01:01:33 THE 787 DREAMLINER. THE PLAYMAKER SAYS THIS IS NOT

01:01:35 REPRESENT THE WORK IT IS DONE TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THE

01:01:39 PLANE. SHARES OF BOEING SO FAR THIS

01:01:42 YEAR ARE DOWN 30%. SCRUTINY OVER MANUFACTURING

01:01:47 PRACTICES HAD BEEN BUILDING SINCE THE MID AIR IN EARLY

01:01:48 JANUARY. THAT IS YOUR BRIEF. JONATHAN:

01:01:51 PRETTY CONCERNING STUFF. EARLY RUN, PROMOTING THE

01:01:56 INTERVIEW WITH TOM TZITZOURIS. IF YOU'RE JOINING US, LISTEN TO

01:01:58 THIS LINE. WASHINGTON COMMITTED TO RUNNING

01:02:04 THE ECONOMY AT FULL EMPLOYMENT FORECAST UNTIL THE ELECTION AND

01:02:07 THE FED IS LOOKING FOR EVERY EXCUSE POSSIBLE TO CUT AID.

01:02:11 THESE ARE THE KIND OF THINGS PEOPLE WHISPER.

01:02:14 THEY HAVE QUITE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT.

01:02:17 THE CYNICAL PEOPLE AMONGST US. LISA:

01:02:23 THIS IS AN ACTIVE CONVERSATION IN TERMS OF POLICY.

01:02:27 YET THERE IS THIS ULTIMATE QUESTION, WHERE IS THE MANDATE

01:02:28 NOW? KEEPING INFLATION DENTED TO 2%

01:02:33 -- DOWN TO 2%. IN TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT THAT IS

01:02:35 AN IMPORTANT ONE. THAT IS WHERE THE MINDSET HAS

01:02:37 SHIFTED. JONATHAN: WE'LL HAVE A CONVERSATION LATER

01:02:40 THIS HOUR. UP NEXT, THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION TAKING ON CHINA.

01:02:48 >> CHINA'S WHOLE STRATEGY IS TO ISOLATE THE PHILIPPINES.

01:02:52 ISOLATE AUSTRALIA WITH ECONOMIC ORIGIN. ISOLATE JAPAN.

01:02:54 OUR STRATEGY IS TO FLIP THAT SCRIPT AND MAKE THE ISOLATED

01:02:58 PARTY CHINA. JONATHAN: LIVE FROM NEW YORK THIS

01:03:01 MORNING, GOOD MORNING.

01:03:07 ♪

01:03:53 JONATHAN: ONE HOUR, 15 MINUTES AWAY FROM

01:03:55 INFLATION DATA IN AMERICA. THE EQUITY MARKET DEAD FLAT

01:03:57 GOING INTO IT. FUTURES JUST ABOUT POSITIVE BY

01:04:00 .1%. YIELDS LOWER BY A SINGLE BASIS

01:04:04 POINT. THINGS ARE WARMING UP. 434.97.

01:04:10 IT'S BEEN SO QUIET SO FAR THIS WEEK.

01:04:12 HE WILL PICK AT 8:30 EASTERN TIME.

01:04:15 ON SURVEILLANCE THIS MORNING, THE ADMINISTRATION TAKING ON

01:04:16 CHINA.

01:04:20 >> CHINA'S WHOLE STRATEGY IS TO ISOLATE THE PHILIPPINES.

01:04:24 ISOLATE AUSTRALIA WITH THEIR ECONOMIC ORIGIN. ISOLATE JAPAN.

01:04:27 OUR STRATEGY IS TO FLIP THAT SCRIPT AND MAKE THE ISOLATED

01:04:31 PARTY CHINA. THEY ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE

01:04:33 ISOLATED IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA AS IT RELATES TO THE

01:04:34 PHILIPPINES. THEY ISOLATED WHEN IT COMES TO

01:04:41 USE ECONOMIC ORIGIN TO COERCE AUSTRALIA TO CHANGE THEIR

01:04:42 POSTURE. THEY BECOME THE ICE LATER PARTY.

01:04:47 JONATHAN: PRESIDENT BIDEN LOOKING TO

01:04:50 CRACKDOWN ON CHINA'S ISOLATIONIST TACTICS, HOSTING

01:04:52 THE PRIME MINISTERS OF JAPAN AND THE PHILIPPINES TONIGHT

01:04:54 BEFORE A SUMMIT TOMORROW.

01:05:00 I WANT TO GO THROUGH THIS LINE FROM THE AMBASSADOR.

01:05:03 OUR STRATEGY IS TO FLIP THE SCRIPT AND MAKE THE ISOLATED

01:05:04 PARTY CHINA. HOW IS THAT GOING DOWN IN CHINA?

01:05:10 DANI: -- ENDA: IT WOULD BE A BIG ASK ISOLATE

01:05:14 CHINA. HERE IN WASHINGTON WITH JAPAN

01:05:21 AND THE PHILIPPINES IT'S ALL ABOUT COORDINATION AND

01:05:23 COOPERATION AT THE SECURITY STAGE.

01:05:25 THAT'S A HANDFUL OF NATIONS. ASIA IS MUCH BIGGER THAN THE

01:05:28 PHILIPPINES AND JAPAN AND AUSTRALIA.

01:05:31 THERE IS PLENTY ACCORDING GONE ON CHINA'S SIDE.

01:05:35 IT IS FAR TOO EARLY TO SAY THERE IS ISOLATION GOING ON AS

01:05:41 BEST -- AT BEST THEY LOOK FAIRLY MODEST. IT'S ABOUT

01:05:42 COOPERATION. THEY WILL BE SOME ADDITIONAL

01:05:46 COOPERATION ON U.S. NAVAL BASALS REPAIRED OR

01:05:49 MAINTAINED AND JAPANESE SHIPYARDS.

01:05:52 MORE CORONATION AROUND TECHNOLOGY AND AI.

01:05:58 IT'S ALL ABOUT BUILDING UP THIS DRUMBEAT OF SUPPORT AGAINST

01:06:02 CHINA'S CLAIMS OVER TAIWAN AND TENSIONS IN CHINA.

01:06:05 -- IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA. THAT IS COORDINATION.

01:06:09 ISOLATING CHINA IS ANOTHER STORY ALTOGETHER. ANNMARIE:

01:06:13 IF YOU LOOK AT DEFENSE, THIS COMES ON THE HEELS OF NAVAL

01:06:17 EXERCISES BETWEEN THE PHILIPPINES, JAPAN AND THE

01:06:18 UNITED STATES. THAT WAS A HUGE WARNING SIGN TO

01:06:20 CHINA. IS THIS THEIR DIPLOMATIC WAY OF

01:06:26 PUSHING BACK EVEN MORE ON CHINA, ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTH

01:06:27 CHINA SEA? ENDA: IT VERY MUCH IS.

01:06:31 THERE WAS A WHITE HOUSE STATEMENT MAKING A POINT THEY

01:06:35 WANT TO SEND A SIGNAL THAT CHINA NEEDS TO KNOW WHERE THEIR

01:06:38 LIMITS ARE FOR ITS AGGRESSION AND ITS CLAIMS IN THE EAST AND

01:06:41 SOUTH CHINA SEA. THOSE DRILLS VERY UNUSUAL WITH

01:06:46 AUSTRALIA, THE PHILIPPINES, JAPAN AND THE U.S.

01:06:47 SENDING A CLEAR SIGNAL. AS THE TALKS WITH JAPAN AND

01:06:52 WITH THE PHILIPPINES TOMORROW, IT'S ALL ABOUT CREATING THIS

01:06:57 IDEA, THE OPTICS THERE IS AN ALLIANCE AND PUSHBACK AMONG

01:06:59 ALLIES AGAINST CHINA'S CLAIMS IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD.

01:07:04 CHINA IS SELF DOES HAVE ITS OWN ALLIES IN THE REGION.

01:07:07 CHINA REMAINS THE MOST POWERFUL ECONOMIC FORCE IN THAT REGION.

01:07:11 IT IS NOT LIKE WHATEVER COMES OUT OF THESE TALKS TODAY AND

01:07:15 TOMORROW IS GOING TO RESULT IN CHINA NECESSARILY TAKING A STEP

01:07:16 BACK. ANNMARIE: RAHM EMANUEL TALKED ABOUT THIS

01:07:21 NO MULTILATERAL APPROACH. HOW DOES THE UNITED STATES DO

01:07:25 THAT WHEN THE PRESIDENT HAS COME OUT IN OPPOSITION OF

01:07:33 NIPPON S TEEL TAKING OVER U.S. STEEL EVEN THOUGH JAPAN SAYS

01:07:34 IT'S ONE WAY TO FIGHT CHINA? ENDA:

01:07:40 THIS IS THE STEEL ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM.

01:07:44 THERE'S POLITICS AND ECONOMICS HERE.

01:07:47 THE ECONOMICS ARE, THE U.S. IS ASKING ALLIES TO DO MORE TO

01:07:48 RESTRICT TECHNOLOGY INTO CHINA AND HELP IT IN HIS PUSHBACK

01:07:50 AGAINST CHINA.

01:07:56 YOU HAVE JAPAN TRYING TO BUY THAT STEEL PLANT IN THE U.S.

01:07:58 AND THE PRESIDENT GIVING HIS DISAPPROVAL OF IT.

01:08:01 IT HAS NOT BEEN BLOCKED OUT RIGHT BUT HIS DISAPPROVAL WHICH

01:08:04 IS UNUSUAL. WHAT SIGNAL DOES THIS SEND

01:08:08 ABOUT THE U.S. ATTITUDE TOWARDS FOREIGN

01:08:09 INVESTMENT AMONG ALLIES? THE POLITICS ARE ALSO PRETTY

01:08:12 REAL. THIS IS A SENSITIVE SECTOR, THE

01:08:19 STEEL SECTOR, IN A SENSITIVE ELECTORAL STATE. PENNSYLVANIA.

01:08:25 THERE IS NO DOUBT POLITICS HAS TRUMPED WHAT IS GOING ON HERE.

01:08:30 THE QUESTION REMAINS HOW MUCH MORE DAMAGE DOES IT DUE TO THE

01:08:33 U.S. STANDING IN THE WORLD OF FREE-TRADE?

01:08:36 CHINESE STATE MEDIA ARE DINING OUT ON IT.

01:08:42 THERE'S A VIEW THAT THE PRIME MINISTER HAS SAID HE DOES NOT

01:08:44 PLAN TO RAISE THIS WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN TODAY. LISA:

01:08:47 WE TALKED ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF ISOLATING CHINA AND HOW IT'S

01:08:50 BEING RECEIVED. SOME OF RAHM EMANUEL'S FIERY

01:08:54 WORDS. YOU SEE APPLE JUST QUIETLY

01:08:58 SHIFTING PRODUCTION OUT OF CHINA AND INTO INDIA.

01:09:04 AT THE SAME TIME THEY DON'T REALLY SELL IN INDIA BECAUSE

01:09:06 INDIA IS FLOODED WITH CHEAP CHINESE PHONES THAT REALLY

01:09:07 DOMINATE THE MARKET. HOW MUCH HAS THIS BECOME PART

01:09:12 OF THE ISSUE FOR THE UNITED STATES THAT CHINA IS FLOODING

01:09:15 THE MARKET GLOBALLY WITH CHEAP GOODS THAT IT WANTS TO SELL NOT

01:09:18 JUST OF THE U.S. BUT CROWDING OUT COMPETITION

01:09:21 ELSEWHERE? ENDA: IT SEEMS TO HAVE BECOME THE

01:09:22 TOPIC OF THE MOMENT. THE MAIN MESSAGING FROM

01:09:28 SECRETARY YELLEN'S TRIP LAST WEEK WAS ALL ABOUT THE IDEA

01:09:33 THAT CHINA IS MAKING TOO MUCH EXCESS PRODUCE AND DUMPING IT

01:09:37 ON GLOBAL MARKETS AT GOOD PRICES.

01:09:43 DURING THAT SPEECH JANET YELLEN MADE THE POINT IT WAS NOT JUST

01:09:44 A THREAT TO U.S. FACTORIES AND U.S. WORKERS.

01:09:48 IT WAS A THREAT TO WORKERS AROUND THE REST OF THE WORLD TO

01:09:50 DRUM UP SUPPORT. WE HAVE THE BIG IMF WORLD BANK

01:09:56 MEETING HERE NEXT WEEK ON THE FINANCE MINISTERS WILL BE IN

01:09:58 WASHINGTON, D.C. I WOULD BE INTERESTED TO SEE

01:10:01 WHAT KIND OF SUPPORT WHICH COUNTRIES WAY IN BEHIND

01:10:05 U.S.-BUT COMPLAINED THAT CHINA IS NOW STOKING A NEW CHINA

01:10:09 SHOCK WITH THE EXPORT OF ITS EXCESS CAPACITY AROUND THE

01:10:11 WORLD. SO FAR THE ARGUMENT HAS NOT

01:10:16 REALLY LET UP OR TAKEN OFF GLOBALLY. IT IS MOSTLY U.S.-LED.

01:10:23 LISA: IT RAISES THE QUESTION OF WHETHER COUNTRIES HAVE TO

01:10:28 CHOOSE ALLIANCES, WHETHER TO GO WITH THE UNITED STATES AND THE

01:10:32 CONCEPT OF AVOIDING GOODS THAT ARE CHEAPER, BUT FROM CHINA TO

01:10:36 GETTING OVER THE UNITED STATES, OR WHETHER THEY CAN MOVE TO

01:10:40 THEIR OWN MUSIC AND IF THEY WANT CHEAPER GOODS AND IMPORT

01:10:41 THEM FROM CHINA, GO FOR IT. ENDA: THIS IS THE BIG ECONOMIC

01:10:45 TRADE-OFF. NO DEATH THAT CHINA HAS BEEN A

01:10:49 SOURCE OF CHEAPER LABOR, CHEAPER MANUFACTURING, LOWER

01:10:52 ENVIRONMENT OF STANDARDS. THAT IS WHY THE WORLD'S FACTORY

01:10:57 BASE IS BASED THEIR. CONSUMERS END UP WITH CHEAPER

01:11:02 CLOTHING AND GOODS, CHEAPER STEEL.

01:11:06 WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING CHOICES COUNTRIES IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH

01:11:10 ARE NOT IN THE MOOD FOR MAKING A CHOICE BETWEEN EITHER THE U.S.

01:11:11 OR CHINA RIGHT NOW. THEY ARE HAPPY TO DO BUSINESS.

01:11:16 WE SAW THE COMMENTS FROM THE ARGENTINIAN PRESIDENT.

01:11:19 COMPANIES WILL DO PRESIDENT WOULD CHINA AS THEY WISH.

01:11:23 IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO THE BINARY LENS OF WITH THE U.S.

01:11:26 OVER AGAINST ON THE ECONOMIC FRONT, THAT IS NOT YET HOW IT'S

01:11:28 PLAYING OUT. JONATHAN: TOTALLY MISSED THE BOAT.

01:11:33 SOMETHING SEEMS SO STALE TO ME OVER THE LAST WEEK.

01:11:36 THERE IS NOTHING FRESH, NOTHING NEW IN THIS WHATSOEVER.

01:11:38 LET'S DISSECT THE LINKAGE AGAIN. CHINA WANTS TO ISOLATE

01:11:41 AUSTRALIA AND JAPAN. WE WANT TO FLIP THE SCRIPT TO

01:11:44 MAKE CHINA ISOLATED. DO YOU REMEMBER TPP,

01:11:48 TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP? THAT INCLUDED JAPAN, AUSTRALIA.

01:11:52 WHO DID NOT INCLUDE? CHINA. WASN'T AT THE PLANT EIGHT YEARS

01:11:55 AGO. ARE WE TRYING TO REFRESH THAT

01:11:57 ALL OVER AGAIN? ENDA: QUITE RIGHT.

01:12:01 THERE'S A LOT OF REPETITION. IT IS TRUE OF THE OVERCAPACITY

01:12:05 DEBATE. YOU MENTIONED TPP. THAT WAS SOLD BY THE U.S.

01:12:13 ADMINISTRATION AT THE TIME AS A GRANT BARGAIN TO BUILD A

01:12:15 TRADING NETWORK IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC WITHOUT CHINA.

01:12:18 IT WAS DISCARDED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP. HERE WE ARE TODAY.

01:12:22 WHILE ACCOUNTS IF YOU LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENING OVER THE PAST

01:12:27 FOR YEARS CHINA HAS GROWN ITS EXPORT BASE.

01:12:28 IT HAS GROWN ITS ECONOMIC TRADING CLOUT AROUND THE WORLD.

01:12:32 IT CONTINUES TO COURT THE GLOBAL SOUTH. AS THE U.S.

01:12:40 BUILDS ITS ALLIANCES AND PUTS ON THE PORTRAYAL OF THE

01:12:42 ALLIANCE WITH JAPAN AND THE PHILIPPINES, CHINA IS BUILDING

01:12:46 ITS OWN ALLIANCES AND ITS OWN TRADING NETWORKS.

01:12:51 IT IS NOT AS SIMPLE AS SAYING CHINA IS BEING ISOLATED.

01:12:53 THEY ARE CONTINUING TO BUILD THEIR ALLIANCES. JONATHAN:

01:12:56 GOOD TO CATCH UP WITH YOU. THE FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP BLEW

01:13:00 UP TPP WHEN HE CAME TO OFFICE. NOTHING NEW ABOUT ANY OF THIS.

01:13:03 WHAT IS NEW? HARDLY ANYTHING. EIGHT YEARS AGO, WHAT HAPPENED?

01:13:10 THE ELECTORATE SAID NO AND YES TO DONALD TRUMP AND ULTIMATELY

01:13:12 NO ONE CAN CAMPAIGN OF THESE ISSUES ANYMORE GOING INTO

01:13:17 NOVEMBER. ANNMARIE:

01:13:18 IT IS WHY THIS NIPPON STEEL DEAL WILL LIKELY GET BLOWN UP.

01:13:22 MAYBE WE WILL NOT GET ANY SORT OF CONSENSUS ON WHAT TO DO WITH

01:13:27 THE STEEL UNTIL AFTER NOVEMBER 5. JONATHAN:

01:13:30 STRONG WORDS WITH BACK IT UP WITH POLICY. LISA:

01:13:33 THAT LEADS TO THE EXPECT OF TARIFFS THAT WILL PROBABLY COME

01:13:34 BEFORE THE ELECTION. HOW MUCH DAYLIGHT IS THERE

01:13:39 BETWEEN THE TWO CANDIDATES AND HOW THEY GET AHEAD OF SOMETHING

01:13:41 THAT SEEMS ALMOST LIKE AN INEVITABILITY? JONATHAN:

01:13:48 BYTEDANCE'S PROFITS SURGING 60% IN 2023.

01:14:03 JON: ABOUT 60 MINUTES AND 30 SECONDS.

01:14:11 EQUITY FUTURES NOW ON THE S&P POSITIVE BY .1%.

01:14:16 UNCHANGED ON THE NASDAQ, POSITIVE BY A QUARTER OF A

01:14:18 PERCENT ON THE RUSSELL.

01:14:25 WE HAVE -- WE ARE CLOSE TO 4.8% ON THE TWO YEAR.

01:14:30 ON THE 10 YEAR, AROUND 4.4%.

01:14:37 PERHAPS ENCOURAGED BY WHAT'S DEVELOPING IN COMMODITIES,

01:14:40 BRENT AND WTI. BRENT CRUDE $89.97.

01:14:49 MORE OF A SENSE OF EASE IN THE MIDDLE EAST IN TERMS OF SOME

01:14:53 RESOLUTION OR LACK OF AN ESCALATION.

01:15:02 THERE IS A NEW CONSENSUS TRADE WITH COMMODITIES AND OIL.

01:15:07 IF THAT'S THE CASE, HOW MUCH DOES THIS HAVE FUEL TO GO

01:15:09 FURTHER?

01:15:12 >> OVERWEIGHT COMMODITIES.

01:15:18 LORI CAMPESINOS STICKING WITH ENERGY.

01:15:21 THE MIDDLE EAST IS QUIET. WE HAVE SILENCE OVER THE

01:15:24 WEEKEND. WHAT WERE WE WAITING FOR?

01:15:28 A RESPONSE FROM IRAN.

01:15:34 GAUGING THE PROSPECT OF A CONFRONTATION BETWEEN ISRAEL

01:15:35 AND IRAN.

01:15:42 I THINK CRUDE SOLD OFF BUT IT'S CONSTRUCTIVE.

01:15:44 WE HAVE THE PROSPECT OF CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THOSE

01:15:47 COUNTRIES.

01:15:48 >> NETANYAHU HAS SAID HE HAS A DATE IN MIND OF WHEN HE WANTS

01:15:56 TO GOING TO IRAQ -- GO INTO RAFAH.

01:15:59 THIS STORY IS FAR FROM OVER.

01:16:01 >> $89.92 ON BRENT. ON WTI, $85.73.

01:16:09 JUST UNDER AN HOUR AWAY FROM THE U.S. CPI REPORT.

01:16:14 THE MEDIAN ESTIMATE IS CALLING FOR 0.3% MONTHLY RISE, A SLIGHT

01:16:19 TICK DOWN FROM A MONTH AGO. YOU HAVE THE SURVEY AND OUR

01:16:24 SURVEY AND WHAT WE PRICE FOR. WE HAVE EXPLAINED THE

01:16:28 DIFFERENCE.

01:16:31 >> PRICED FOR AN UPSIDE

01:16:37 SURPRISE AROUND 0.4%, THE I -- THE IDEA THAT THIS

01:16:42 INFLATIONARY STORY -- DOES THIS SET UP THE MARKET FOR A MUCH

01:16:46 BIGGER REACTION IF WE GET A DOWNSIDE SURPRISE OR AN IN-LINE

01:16:48 NUMBER THAN WE WOULD OTHERWISE EXPECT?

01:16:54 OR ARE WE LOOKING AT IF WE GET THAT THE NARRATIVE SHIFT WE

01:16:56 HEARD FROM AMY SILVERMAN THAT COULD BE A PIVOT POINT?

01:17:03 >> I LOVE STEPHEN STANLEY AT SANTANDER BECAUSE HE BRINGS UP

01:17:08 GOVERNOR WALLER'S POINT BECAUSE THEY WILL NEED TWO CONSECUTIVE

01:17:09 MONTHS OF THAT BENIGN INFLATION STORY.

01:17:12 THAT GETS UP TO THE JUNE DATE.

01:17:18 ANALYSTS ARE STARTING TO SPIN THE RESULTS, THIS IDEA OF .3%

01:17:24 MONTH OVER MONTH IS BASICALLY GOOD, EVEN THOUGH WE WOULD HAVE

01:17:26 TO SEE THAT BEFORE THE FED CONSIDERS.

01:17:30 >> THIS IS WHY IT'S A LOSE-LOSE FOR THE FED.

01:17:35 IF THEY HAVE TO WAIT, THEY GET ACCUSED OF WAITING TOO LONG.

01:17:38 IF THEY ARE TOO CLOSE TO THE ELECTION, IT'S POLITICS.

01:17:43 THIS IS THE PROBLEM.

01:17:50 >> BASICALLY, IF THEY ARE DOING AN OK JOB AND THERE'S NOTHING

01:17:53 DRAMATIC TO TALK ABOUT, PEOPLE NEED TO DO SOMETHING WITH THEIR

01:17:56 DAY, SO YOU HAVE PEOPLE ANALYZING THEMSELVES INTO A

01:17:59 TIZZY. THAT IS POTENTIALLY PROBLEMATIC.

01:18:01 THAT'S ALSO WHAT'S GOING ON TO A DEGREE.

01:18:08 >> DELTA SHARES RISING IN THE PREMARKET, REPORTING

01:18:09 FIRST-QUARTER EARNINGS. ALSO COMING OUT WITH STRONG

01:18:16 GUIDANCE FOR THE SECOND QUARTER ON THE BACK OF INCREASED

01:18:19 BUSINESS TRAVEL AND STEADY LEISURE DEMAND, UP CLOSE TO 4%.

01:18:22 SOME STRONG WORDS COMING FROM THE CEO.

01:18:27 >> BASICALLY SAYING THEY DON'T SEE ANY END IN SIGHT TO DEMAND.

01:18:34 EVEN THOUGH YOU TYPICALLY SEE A LULL IN TERMS OF TRAVEL AHEAD

01:18:35 OF THE SUMMER, YOU ARE NOT. THEY ARE EXPECTING THE HIGHER

01:18:39 END OF THE ESTIMATES. IT INDICATES THE STRENGTH IN

01:18:43 THE UNDERLYING CONSUMER BUT ALSO WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT

01:18:48 WITH GEORGE FERGUSON, THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE DOING WELL.

01:18:52 >> IS THE PEOPLE AT THE FRONT OF THE BUS, THE PLANE, THAT'S

01:18:59 BASICALLY PROPPING UP ALL OF THIS WHEN IT COMES TO THE

01:19:02 REVENUE AND PROFIT THIS AIRLINE IS MAKING, AND POTENTIALLY WE

01:19:07 SEE UNITED SAID TO COME OUT, THEIR STOCK BEING PUSHED HIGHER.

01:19:12 >> LET'S TALK ABOUT WHO IS MAKING MONEY, BYTEDANCE

01:19:15 REPORTING A PROFIT SURGE OF 60% LAST YEAR.

01:19:18 UNDERSCORING THE STRENGTH OF THE APP.

01:19:22 THE COMPANY FACING AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE IN THE U.S.

01:19:27 THE HOUSE PASSING A BILL TO

01:19:31 MAKE TIKTOK BE SOLD BY BYTEDANCE UNLESS CONDITIONS ARE

01:19:36 MET. MANDEEP SINGH. STRONG NUMBERS FROM BYTEDANCE.

01:19:41 DECENT NUMBERS OUT OF ASIA WHEN IT COMES TO TECH.

01:19:44 WHAT IS BEHIND IT?

01:19:47 >> DIFFERENT STORY IN THE CASE OF BYTEDANCE.

01:19:51 IT IS THE STRENGTH OF THEIR APP AND HOW THE AD SPENDING IS

01:19:52 BOUNCING. I DON'T THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH

01:19:56 THE TIKTOK U.S. BUSINESS AS MUCH AS THE

01:19:57 DOMESTIC BUSINESS.

01:20:03 IN THE CASE OF TSMC, IT COMES

01:20:09 DOWN TO EVERY IPLAYER -- EVERY PLAYER.

01:20:13 THEY HAVE PRICING POWER AND HAVE NOT FLEXED IT AS MUCH AS

01:20:15 NVIDIA HAS ON THE CHIP THEY ARE SELLING.

01:20:20 IN THE CASE OF TSMC, THEY HAVE TALKED ABOUT A 50% KICKER FOR

01:20:23 THEIR AI BUSINESS OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS.

01:20:28 THIS IS A COMPANY EVERY HYPER SCALER WOULD GO TO.

01:20:34 AND I THINK YOU HAVE CLEAR -- HAVE A CLEAR LINE OF SIGHT IN

01:20:35 TERMS OF HOW THIS BUSINESS COULD GROW.

01:20:38 >> TSMC HAS A WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH NVIDIA AND

01:20:42 APPLE. CAN YOU READ INTO THESE NUMBERS

01:20:46 AND STRENGTH ELSEWHERE AS WELL?

01:20:50 >> IN THE CASE OF APPLE, YES. IT BODES WELL FOR A REFRESH

01:20:54 CYCLE. WE DON'T HAVE CLARITY ON WHAT

01:20:57 THEY ARE DOING ON THE AI SIDE. BUT CLEARLY THE DATA CENTER

01:21:01 SPENDING IS HOLDING UP NICELY. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS

01:21:08 THAT GOOGLE AND AMAZON AND MICROSOFT HAVE TALKED ABOUT IN

01:21:12 TERMS OF THEIR CAPEX GOING UP, THAT ALL IS GOING TOWARDS

01:21:16 BUYING NVIDIA CHIPS AND GOING DIRECTLY TO TSMC TO MAKE THE

01:21:20 ROUND, WHICH IS WHAT GOOGLE INDICATED.

01:21:24 >> THERE'S A LARGER QUESTION THAT WAS INTRODUCED YESTERDAY

01:21:26 WHEN INTEL CAME OUT WITH THE IDEA OF ANOTHER AI CHIP, WHICH

01:21:30 IS HOW SATURATED IS THIS MARKET? IS THIS SOMETHING NVIDIA CAN

01:21:37 DOMINATE AND OTHERS CAN GROW OR IS THE ENTRY OF NEW PLAYERS

01:21:38 PROBLEMATIC?

01:21:41 >> I CAN TELL YOU THE MARKET IS CONSTRAINED.

01:21:43 WE HAVE GATHERED THAT FROM A NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS WHO KEEP

01:21:48 SAYING NVIDIA CHIPS ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY, THE H100 AND A100.

01:21:56 SO GIVEN THE SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS, I WOULD SAY THIS

01:21:59 YEAR, YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT INTEL MAKING A DENT.

01:22:04 GOOGLE IS MAKING THEIR OWN CPU. THAT'S GOING TO HURT INTEL.

01:22:10 INTEL IS THE DOMINANT PLAYER WHEN IT COMES TO THE CPU MARKET.

01:22:15 EVERY HYPER SCALER IS MAKING THEIR OWN CPU.

01:22:17 THAT HURTS INTEL AND AMD. IT HELPS THE BUILDING BLOCK

01:22:23 COMPANIES, BUT NOT THE CHIPMAKERS IN THE CPU SPACE.

01:22:29 >> WITH TSMC, HOW MUCH OF A CLUTCH TO THEY HAVE.

01:22:34 WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT SEEING PRODUCTION IN OTHER PLACES.

01:22:36 IS THAT NOT HAPPENING?

01:22:39 >> THEY ARE AND THEY ARE DIVERSIFYING.

01:22:42 I WOULD ARGUE THEY STARTED A NEW FAB IN JAPAN. THAT'S ALIVE.

01:22:47 IT'S MANUFACTURING CHIPS. SO THAT DIVERSIFICATION PLAY IS

01:22:50 HAPPENING. IN THE U.S., IT IS STILL SLOW.

01:22:56 THEY ANNOUNCED A NEW ROUND OF FUNDING FROM THE CHIPS ACT.

01:23:00 THEY CLEARLY STILL HAVE THE SECRET SAUCE WHEN IT COMES TO

01:23:01 THE ADVANCEMENT OF MANUFACTURING.

01:23:04 INTEL TOUTED THE PERFORMANCE OF THEIR CHIP YESTERDAY BUT HAVE

01:23:09 NOT ANNOUNCED A LARGE COMPANY BUYING CHIPS FROM INTEL.

01:23:14 THAT'S THE PROOF POINT THAT INTEL NEEDS TO GIVE TO CONVINCE

01:23:18 INVESTORS THEY ARE UP THERE, COMPETING WITH NVIDIA.

01:23:21 >> I WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT BYTEDANCE.

01:23:23 IT'S THE FIRST TIME IT'S OVERTAKEN TENCENT WHEN IT COMES

01:23:27 TO REVENUE AND PROFIT. YOU LOOK AT THE U.S. BUSINESS.

01:23:31 THEY WANT TO GROW IT TENFOLD. THIS WILL BE LUCRATIVE.

01:23:38 HOW EXISTENTIAL IS A GIVEN THE POLITICS ROOM TIKTOK?

01:23:42 >> I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF TIKTOK IS ABLE TO GET INTO

01:23:46 E-COMMERCE IN THAT BIG OF A FASHION UNDER THE CURRENT

01:23:52 OWNERSHIP.

01:23:53 WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MORE TRANSACTIONAL DATA AND I CANNOT

01:23:54 SEE REGULATORS ALLOWING THAT TO HAPPEN.

01:23:55 >> WHAT IS STOPPING?

01:23:59 >> THEY HAVE TO BILL A DELIVERY BUSINESS.

01:24:02 YOU THINK ABOUT AMAZON GOES ABOUT FULFILLING THE E-COMMERCE

01:24:04 SIDE OF THINGS. TIKTOK DOES NOT HAVE ANYTHING

01:24:08 LIKE THAT. THEY HAVE TO PARTNER WITH A

01:24:12 LARGE E-COMMERCE PLAYER. FOR THAT TO HAPPEN, I CANNOT

01:24:19 IMAGINE ANY COMPANY ANNOUNCING A PARTNERSHIP WITH TIKTOK.

01:24:23 >> MAYBE WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL NOVEMBER.

01:24:29 IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S NO -- THERE'S NOW A CEILING ON HOW

01:24:30 MUCH TIKTOK COULD GROW.

01:24:31 >> IN THE U.S. OUTSIDE THE U.S., THEY HAVE

01:24:35 APPS THEY CONTINUE TO SEE HEALTHY USER GROWTH.

01:24:38 THEY ARE DOING WELL DOMESTICALLY.

01:24:42 SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT COMPANIES LIKE BY -- LIKE BYTEDANCE, YOU

01:24:47 HAVE TO DO A SUM OF THE PARTS ANALYSIS.

01:24:49 >> APPRECIATE THAT. MANDEEP SINGH.

01:24:54 EQUITIES POSITIVE BY 0.1% ON THE S&P.

01:24:57 INFLATION DATA 50 MINUTES AWAY. HERE IS YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF

01:25:01 WITH DANI BURGER.

01:25:05 >> AT LEAST THREE PEOPLE ARE DEAD AFTER AN EXPLOSION AT A

01:25:06 NORTHERN ITALIAN HYDROPOWER PLANT.

01:25:11 THE COMPANY SET A FIRE IMPACTED A TRANSFORMER WITHOUT PROVIDING

01:25:12 FURTHER DETAILS. ITALY'S LARGEST POWER SUPPLIER

01:25:18 SHUT THE PLANE DOWN IMMEDIATELY FOR SAFETY REASONS.

01:25:23 RAPHAEL BOSTIC STILL SEES JUST ONE RATE CUT THIS YEAR BUT SAYS

01:25:28 HE'S OPEN TO CHANGING HIS OUTLOOK OF CONDITIONS CHANGE.

01:25:33 HE GAVE HIMSELF FOR OPTIONALITY, SAYING THE U.S.

01:25:38 ECONOMY CONTINUES TO SHOW RESILIENCE, SO HE CANNOT

01:25:39 DISCOUNT THE POSSIBILITY THAT RATE CUTS HAVE TO MOVE FURTHER

01:25:40 OUT.

01:25:46 BMW SALES OF FULLY ELECTRIC VEHICLES JUMPED 41 PERCENT IN

01:25:50 THE FIRST QUARTER. MERCEDES REPORTED EV SALES THAT

01:25:58 FELL 8% IN THE FIRST QUARTER WHILE TESLA REPORTED ITS FIRST

01:26:00 YEAR ON YEAR SALES DROP SINCE 2020.

01:26:05 EV IS MADE UP ROUGHLY 50% OF BMW'S TOTAL DELIVERIES LAST

01:26:08 YEAR WITH THE FIGURE EXPECTED TO RISE TO 20% IN 2024.

01:26:11 >> GOOD PIECE OF NEWS. THANK YOU.

01:26:15 THERE HAS BEEN BAD NEWS IN THAT SPACE.

01:26:19 I HAVE BEEN CHEERING THIS QUOTE ALL MORNING.

01:26:24 WASHINGTON COMMITTED TO RUN THE ECONOMY AT FULL EMPLOYMENT AT

01:26:27 ALL COSTS UNTIL THE ELECTION AND THE FED LOOKING FOR EVERY

01:26:29 EXCUSE POSSIBLE TO CUT. UP NEXT, THE FED IN POLITICS.

01:26:38 >> IF THEY CUT IN JUNE OR JULY, THEY WILL BE

01:26:42 CRITICIZED FOR CUTTING TOO MUCH, IN SEPTEMBER, CRITICIZED

01:26:44 FOR CUTTING TO CLOSE TO THE ELECTION.

01:26:47 >> THAT DEBATE NEXT.

01:27:06 >> 46 MINUTES AWAY FROM CPI DATA IN AMERICA.

01:27:11 0.3% IS THE ESTIMATE IN A MEDIAN SURVEY.

01:27:16 THE PREVIOUS RATE 0.7%. EQUITY FUTURES POSITIVE.

01:27:28 UNDER SURVEILLANCE, THE FED GETTING PULLED IN THE POLITICS.

01:27:33 >> PALA'S POLITICAL INCENTIVE IS TO GO INTO THE SUNSET AS THE

01:27:39 PERSON WHO DEFEATED THIS INFLATION.

01:27:42 THEY WILL BE CRITICIZED.

01:27:56 >> LESS THAN ONE HOUR AWAY FROM THE MARCH CPI REPORT, INVESTORS

01:28:00 LOOKING INTO INSIGHT INTO THE FED'S PATH FORWARD.

01:28:07 "WASHINGTON IS COMMITTED TO RUN THE ECONOMY AT FULL EMPLOYMENT

01:28:13 AT ALL COSTS UNTIL THE ELECTION AND THE FED IS LOOKING FOR

01:28:15 EVERY EXCUSE POSSIBLE TO CUT TO AID THIS CAUSE."

01:28:18 TOM, GOOD MORNING TO YOU.

01:28:24 WHAT TELLS YOU THE FED IS LOOKING FOR EVERY EXCUSE

01:28:27 POSSIBLE TO CUT TO AID THE CAUSE OF THE WHITE HOUSE?

01:28:33 >> BECAUSE WE ARE STILL AT FULL EMPLOYMENT, INFLATION IS STILL

01:28:36 WELL AWAY FROM TARGET, AND THE FED IS ALREADY TALKING ABOUT

01:28:40 CUTS. AND ON THE SPEAKING CIRCUIT,

01:28:42 YOU HAVE FED LEADERS TALKING ABOUT RATE CUTS, THE NEED TO

01:28:45 SLOW BALANCE SHEET REDUCTION. THAT'S INDICATIVE OF WANTING TO

01:28:48 EASE SOONER RATHER THAN LATER.

01:28:50 >> DO YOU THINK THAT'S A MISTAKE?

01:28:52 WHY IS IT POLITICAL BIAS?

01:28:56 >> IT'S A MISTAKE IF WE CONTINUE TO BE AT FULL

01:29:00 EMPLOYMENT AND MISS ON THE INFLATION MANDATE BECAUSE IT'S

01:29:04 UNPRECEDENTED TO BE EASING AGGRESSIVELY WHEN YOU ARE

01:29:05 ALREADY AT FULL EMPLOYMENT AND INFLATION IS TOO HIGH.

01:29:10 BY DEFINITION, THAT'S A POLICY MISTAKE.

01:29:12 BUT DO THEY KNOW SOMETHING DIFFERENT OR IS IT A POLITICAL

01:29:14 BIAS? WE DON'T KNOW THAT. WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE

01:29:17 SEEING SOMETHING THAT'S MAKING THEM CONCERNED.

01:29:22 THEY COULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT FINANCIAL STABILITY, WHICH IS

01:29:25 NOT POLITICALLY BIASED, BUT HAS POLITICAL RAMIFICATIONS.

01:29:28 THERE'S A LOT THAT COULD BE WORRYING THEM THAT IS NOT

01:29:29 POLITICAL BIAS BUT IS SUSPICIOUS.

01:29:34 >> TO BE CLEAR, YOU HINT THIS IS A POLITICAL BIAS BECAUSE HE

01:29:35 CANNOT FIND THE JUSTIFICATION IN THE DATA.

01:29:37 IS THAT YOUR CONCLUSION?

01:29:44 >> THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO CONCLUDE.

01:29:45 THAT IS THE MOST SIMPLE CONCLUSION.

01:29:49 THERE'S ANOTHER POSSIBLE CONCLUSION, THAT WE HAVE A

01:29:50 TREASURY DEFICIT THAT IS GARGANTUAN.

01:29:54 IT WILL BECOME PROGRESSIVELY MORE DIFFICULT TO DIGEST. THAT

01:29:58 CAUSES NOT JUST POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES BUT FINANCIAL

01:30:01 INSTABILITY. WE KNOW WELL THAT IS THE

01:30:04 REVERSE REPO FACILITY SHRINKS TOWARD ZERO AND T-BILL ISSUANCE

01:30:08 RAMPS UP, YOU WILL START PULLING MONEY OUT OF BANK

01:30:09 RESERVES. IF THE FED DOESN'T EASE INTO

01:30:13 THAT, THERE'S PURE LIQUIDITY. YOU CANNOT RUN TO TRILLION

01:30:18 DOLLARS DEFICITS YEAR AFTER YEAR.

01:30:19 THERE'S A STABILITY RISK THAT COULD BE MOTIVATING THE FED AS

01:30:22 WELL.

01:30:23 >> I LOVE IT. POTENTIAL POLITICAL MOTIVATION

01:30:27 BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE OR BIAS. TWO, THIS POTENTIAL THE DEFICIT

01:30:31 IS HANGING OVER THEIR HEAD AND THEY WANT TO AMELIORATE SOME OF

01:30:32 THAT. WHAT ABOUT THIS ARGUMENT THAT

01:30:37 YOU ARE SEEING POCKETS OF WEAKNESS IN SEGMENTS OF THE

01:30:41 POPULATION, THAT YOU ARE SEEING SMALL BUSINESS CONFIDENCE COME

01:30:42 IN AT THE LOWEST LEVEL GOING BACK MORE THAN 11 YEARS, THAT

01:30:46 YOU ARE SEEING DELINQUENCIES PICKUP, CERTAIN SEGMENTS HIT

01:30:49 HARD?

01:30:50 >> I AGREE WITH THAT. THAT'S WHY THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE

01:30:54 RAISED RATES. THEY SHOULD HAVE RUN OFF THE

01:30:58 BALANCE SHEET AT A QUICKER PACE. BECAUSE WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS

01:31:05 YOU HAVE SEEN THE FED -- FED FUNDS RATE.

01:31:08 PART OF THE REASON INFLATION HAS REMAINED PERSISTENT IS

01:31:12 BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT USED THE BALANCE SHEET AGGRESSIVELY

01:31:14 ENOUGH AND THE WORLD'S LARGEST VENDOR HAS NOT SEEN ANY

01:31:15 CONSTRAINTS ON IT. IF THEY USED THE BALANCE SHEET

01:31:21 MORE AGGRESSIVELY, THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS STRAIN ON MAIN

01:31:23 STREET AND MORE ON THE BIG SPENDERS.

01:31:27 >> WERE SAYING THEY SHOULD HAVE DISCIPLINED THE GOVERNMENT BY

01:31:28 NOT HELPING THEM?

01:31:30 >> UNDERSTANDING WHERE THE EXCESS AGGREGATE DEMAND IS

01:31:33 COMING FROM. IT'S COMING FROM HIGH NET WORTH

01:31:38 INDIVIDUALS, AFFLUENT HOUSEHOLDS, GOVERNMENT SPENDING.

01:31:48 THE WAY TO RIGNET IN --THE WAY TO REIN THAT AND IS PUT

01:31:50 PRESSURE ON BORROWING COSTS.

01:32:04 THEY CARRY THEIR INVENTORY WITH BANK LINES OF CREDIT.

01:32:07 THEY HAVE SEEN IT GO FROM 3% TO 10%.

01:32:10 PURE BOTTOM UP COST PRESSURE FOR THESE GUYS.

01:32:15 IF YOU LOOK AT LARGE COMPANIES, THEY SEE THEIR BORROWING COSTS

01:32:18 RISE 200 BASIS POINTS MAYBE. IN SOME CASES, NEGATIVE.

01:32:26 YOU ARE LOOKING AT NEGATIVE BORROWING COSTS ON.

01:32:29 SO THERE HAS NOT BEEN ENOUGH TIGHTENING.

01:32:32 >> WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT, FISCAL OR MONETARY POLICY?

01:32:36 >> IN TERMS OF THE LABOR MARKET, FISCAL POLICY.

01:32:39 WE ARE LOOKING AT STIMULUS COMING OUT AGAIN IN 2024 LIKELY

01:32:44 TARGETED TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OR THIRD QUARTER OF THE YEAR.

01:32:48 THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT FOR THE LABOR MARKET BECAUSE IT'S

01:32:50 DESIGNED TO KEEP THE CONSUMER SPENDING.

01:32:53 TALKING ABOUT FINANCIAL MARKETS, MONETARY POLICY IS

01:32:57 MOST IMPORTANT. MONETARY POLICY IS BEING

01:33:00 BLURRED BY THE AMOUNT OF CASH THE TREASURY HAS BEEN PUMPING

01:33:06 INTO THE ECONOMY.

01:33:07 SO WE ARE IN A LIQUIDITY AIR POCKET AS HOUSEHOLDS AND

01:33:08 BUSINESSES PAY THEIR TAXES. PEOPLE ARE PULLING BANK

01:33:12 RESERVES, MONEY MARKET FUNDS. THAT'S PULLING LIQUIDITY OUT OF

01:33:14 THE MARKET. THAT'S ONE REASON WE HAVE SEEN

01:33:19 THE EQUITY MARKETS AND BONDS OFF.

01:33:23 IS THAT RESULTS IN A CASH HORDE BY THE TREASURY THAT WILL COME

01:33:26 OUT THIS YEAR, LIQUIDITY WILL MATTER.

01:33:29 AND IF THE FED EASES INTO THE TREASURY CASH PUSH, YOU ARE

01:33:33 LOOKING AT AN OCEAN OF LIQUIDITY COMING INTO FINANCIAL

01:33:36 MARKETS FROM MAY UNTIL ELECTION DAY.

01:33:40 >> IF WE COULD TALK ABOUT THE ELECTION, THIS IDEA THAT THE

01:33:42 FED WANTS TO AID THE COURSE OF WHAT WE ARE SEEING, POTENTIALLY

01:33:48 KEEPING BIDEN IN THE WHITE HOUSE, HOW MUCH CONSENSUS DOES

01:33:49 POWELL NEED IF HE WANTS TO MAKE THAT CUT?

01:33:52 >> I WOULD STOP SHORT OF SAYING THEY WANT TO KEEP BIDEN IN THE

01:33:56 WHITE HOUSE. I THINK THEY WANT TO KEEP

01:33:58 FINANCIAL STABILITY FOR MANY REASONS, ONE OF WHICH IS IT

01:34:02 CREATES POLITICAL STABILITY, BUT THEIR PRIMARY MOTIVATION IS

01:34:04 STILL FINANCIAL STABILITY. I DON'T THINK THEY CARE ABOUT

01:34:08 THE WHITE HOUSE OR SENATE. THEY WANT TO STABILITY THAT

01:34:11 COMES WITH A STABLE TREASURY MARKET.

01:34:14 THAT COMES WITH HUGE POLITICAL RAMIFICATIONS.

01:34:16 I FORGET THE SECOND QUESTION.

01:34:21 >> HOW MUCH CONSENSUS DOES POWELL NEED?

01:34:24 BECAUSE THE STAKES ARE HIGH AND IT WILL BE SEEN BY MANY THROUGH

01:34:25 THE LENS OF POLITICS.

01:34:27 >> HOW MUCH DO THEY NEED? THEY ALREADY HAVE PROOF THEY

01:34:35 HAVE NOT TIGHTENED ENOUGH. WILL TODAY'S CPI GIVE THEM

01:34:41 PROOF THEY CAN CANNOT CUT THREE TIMES THIS YEAR?

01:34:47 I BELIEVE IF WE GET A HOT CPI, IF THAT COMES IN .4% OR HIGHER

01:34:51 MONTH OVER MONTH, THAT SHOULD TAKE THE JUNE RATE CUT OFF THE

01:34:53 TABLE. IT SHOULD TAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT

01:34:59 FOR A TAPER STARTING IN JUNE OFF THE TABLE AS WELL.

01:35:01 THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH. BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S

01:35:07 ENOUGH FOR THE DOVES IN THE FED TO CONTINUE TO PULL BACK AND

01:35:09 SAY WE HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER MONTH.

01:35:10 BUT THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH. THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR

01:35:13 POWELL TO SAY WE HAVE TOO MUCH INERTIA TO THIS INFLATION.

01:35:16 IT IS STILL TOO STICKY.

01:35:25 IF THERE'S BEEN ONE CASUALTY OF THE FED OVER THE LAST DECADE --

01:35:31 I WOULD STOP SHORT OF SAYING THEIR POLITICAL INDEPENDENCE

01:35:33 HAVE BEEN SACRIFICED, BUT I THINK THERE FOCUS ON A DUAL

01:35:37 MANDATE OF FULL EMPLOYMENT AND PRICE STABILITY HAS BEEN

01:35:41 SACRIFICED BECAUSE OF AN EXCESS FOCUS ON FINANCIAL STABILITY,

01:35:46 WHICH IS NOT ONE OF THEIR LEGAL MANDATES, AND IS PROBABLY THE

01:35:49 LEAST ACHIEVABLE OF THESE PHILOSOPHICAL MANDATES.

01:35:52 THEY REALLY CANNOT ACHIEVE FINANCIAL STABILITY BUT THERE'S

01:35:56 BEEN SUCH A LASER FOCUS ON IT FROM A REGULATORY STANDPOINT TO

01:36:01 SIMPLY A MONETARY POLICY STANDPOINT, KEEPING THE

01:36:02 FINANCIAL MARKETS STABLE.

01:36:04 >> THESE ARE SOME BIG STATEMENTS.

01:36:08 IF THE FED IS WILLING TO DO THAT, YOU ALSO BELIEVE THE

01:36:10 TREASURY SUPPLY COULD BE A FINANCIAL STABILITY RISK AS

01:36:11 WELL?

01:36:17 COULD YOU TELL ME WHAT TO DO AT TREASURIES?

01:36:23 >> WE WAIT FOR THE CPR NUMBER BECAUSE THAT WILL TELL US WHICH

01:36:30 DIRECTION THE FED WILL GO IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS AND TELL US

01:36:31 WHERE IT IS NOT REAL GROWTH GOING TO BE?

01:36:33 THAT'S THE REAL BENCHMARK. THAT'S THE FIRST POINT.

01:36:37 WHAT DO YOU DO WITH TREASURIES?

01:36:43 THEY ARE THE GOLD THAT BACKS OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM.

01:36:45 YOU CANNOT LIQUIDATE THEM COMPLETELY.

01:36:50 SO YOU CANNOT MIGRATE AWAY FROM THEM ENTIRELY.

01:36:51 YOU HAVE TO BE TACTICAL.

01:36:57 WE ARE IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE, DEPENDING ON YOUR MANDATE,

01:37:00 DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU DO, YOU HAVE TO HOLD TREASURIES BUT YOU

01:37:02 DON'T HAVE TO HOLD DURATION. SO YOU CAN MOVE IN AND OUT OF

01:37:06 DURATION. WE START TO SEE FIVE AND 10

01:37:14 YEAR TREASURIES APPROACH WHERE NOMINAL GROWTH IS, THAT'S A

01:37:15 GOOD BUYING OPPORTUNITY.

01:37:17 >> CONTROVERSIAL AT TIMES. THANK YOU. SOME BIG CALLS.

01:37:27 >> TALKING ABOUT WHY THE FED WANTS TO CUT SO BADLY AND HOW

01:37:30 THIS HAS RAISED QUESTIONS OF WHAT COULD BE BEHIND THAT.

01:37:34 IN TERMS OF THE CONCLUSION FOR THE INVESTMENT THESIS, I WONDER

01:37:37 HOW MUCH HE IS ON THE SAME PAGE AS BOB PRINTS, BASICALLY SAYING

01:37:41 NOT CASH BUT SHORT-TERM TREASURIES.

01:37:44 WHAT'S THE MOTIVATION TO LEAVE THAT IF YOU ARE GETTING YIELD?

01:37:47 UNCLEAR WHEN THEY WILL GO LOWER AND RISK OFF.

01:37:50 >> HERE'S THE LINEUP.

01:38:00 LISA, JAMES, STEVE, DAVID, WITH STEVE AND DAVID HAVING

01:38:01 DIFFERENT VIEWS ON WHAT THE FED SHOULD BE DOING AND HOW THEY

01:38:04 VIEW INCOMING INFLATION DATA. THAT'S COMING UP.

01:38:08 >> I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO ANOTHER FACE-OFF.

01:38:14 DAVID TALKING ABOUT HOW THIS IS REAL, STEVE MORE ON THE SAME

01:38:15 PAGE AS TOM.

01:38:17 >> CPI JUST AROUND THE CORNER. 34 MINUTES AWAY.

01:38:21 EQUITY FUTURES POSITIVE. THE SCORES IN THE BOND MARKET

01:38:25 LOOK LIKE THIS. THE 10-YEAR YIELD LOWER BY TWO

01:38:28 BASIS POINTS. ♪

01:38:57 >> WE ARE IN AN ECONOMY THAT STILL HAS A LOT OF INFLATIONARY

01:38:58 PRESSURE.

01:39:02 >> I WOULD NOT ASSUME INFLATION NUMBERS WOULD BE SUPER STICKY

01:39:03 BUT WOULD CERTAINLY BE BUMPY.

01:39:06 >> STILL LOOKING FOR DISINFLATION TO CONTINUE.

01:39:09 >> WE ARE TALKING ABOUT INFLATION BEHAVING.

01:39:13 WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT INFLATION ACCELERATING.

01:39:15 >> INFLATION WILL BE STICKY. AND I DO THINK THAT THAT WORKS

01:39:22 OVER THE LONG-TERM TO THE FED RETHINKING ITS TARGET.

01:39:25 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE WITH JONATHAN

01:39:28 FERRO, LISA ABRAMOWICZ AND ANNMARIE HORDERN.

01:39:30 >> THIS IS WHAT IT'S ABOUT. THE THIRD HOUR OF BLOOMBERG

01:39:34 SURVEILLANCE BEGINS NOW. INFLATION DATA 30 MINUTES AWAY.

01:39:51 , PREVIOUSLY -- THE ESTIMATE 0.3%, PREVIOUSLY 0.4%.

01:39:54 CHAIRMAN POWELL WITH THIS. TOO SOON TO SAY WHETHER THE

01:39:57 RECENT READINGS ARE JUST A BUMP. >> WE WILL GET A SENSE OF HOW

01:40:01 THE MARKET IS SHIFTING. IT SEEMS THERE'S AN INFLECTION

01:40:03 POINT. I WANT TO MAKE A CORRECTION.

01:40:08 IT'S BEEN THRILLING OVER THE PAST 48 HOURS.

01:40:12 WE HAVE GOTTEN TREASURY AUCTIONS, DELTA EARNINGS.

01:40:14 THAT'S WHERE WE ARE AT.

01:40:20 NO ONE CAN REALLY GET AHEAD OF THIS BASED ON THE FACT THAT WE

01:40:23 DON'T HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE FED, THEIR REACTION

01:40:26 FUNCTION, AN UNDERSTANDING OF AN ECONOMY THAT'S THE MOST

01:40:28 CONFUSING I HAVE EVER HEARD OF.

01:40:32 >> LET'S GET TO THE MARKET BOARD AND LOOK AT EQUITY

01:40:33 FUTURES. I BELIEVE ON THE S&P YESTERDAY

01:40:39 WE WERE POSITIVE BY 0.14%. MONDAY, -5.1%.

01:40:44 HUGE, MASSIVE MOVES.

01:40:49 >> DELTA MOVING IN PREMARKET. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS

01:40:52 HOUR. DAVID KELLY. I LOVE HIS NOTE.

01:41:03 IT WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A HUMBLE BREAD.

01:41:06 HE TALKS ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS FOR MONETARY POLICY.

01:41:14 DOES THE PRINT TODAY SUPPORT THAT IN TERMS OF THE FED

01:41:18 CUTTING BEFORE OTHERS SAY THEY NEED TO?

01:41:20 >> NOTHING HUMBLE ABOUT IT. GOOD FOR HIM. WONDERFUL.

01:41:33 >> 28 MINUTES AWAY FROM THAT INFLATION NUMBER.

01:41:38 LISA SHALETT ON HER OUTLOOK, STEVE ON MY RATE CUTS ARE NOT

01:41:42 GUARANTEED, AND DAVID KELLY ONLINE THE TIMING OF CUTS IS

01:41:44 CRUCIAL. CPI DATA JUST AROUND THE CORNER.

01:41:48 LISA SAYING THIS. INFLATION HAS REMAINED STICKY.

01:41:53 FOR THE FED, THE HOT DATA IS NOT SIMPLY A RISK TO ESTIMATES.

01:41:58 IT SHINES A LIGHT ON ITS LONG BIAS TOWARDS CUTTING RATES.

01:42:02 LISA JOINS US FOR MORE. WHERE DOES THAT BIAS TO CUTTING

01:42:05 RATES COME FROM? WHAT'S IT ABOUT?

01:42:09 >> OUR PERSPECTIVE HAS BEEN THAT FOR A LONG TIME THEY HAVE

01:42:12 BEEN FOCUSED ON MANAGING LIQUIDITY.

01:42:16 WE KNOW, AS SOME OF YOUR PRIOR GUESTS TALKED ABOUT, LIQUIDITY

01:42:20 HAS BEGUN TO FINALLY DRAIN OUT OF THE SYSTEM.

01:42:24 THIS HAS BEEN A 2.5 YEAR PERIOD WHERE FINANCIAL CONDITIONS HAVE

01:42:29 REMAINED EXTRAORDINARILY ACCOMMODATIVE AND I THINK THEY

01:42:35 WANT TO CUT SO THEY GET TO QT, THE TAPERING OF QT.

01:42:40 THEY HAVE TRIED TO KEEP AN ORDER TO THINGS.

01:42:44 THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT, MANAGING LIQUIDITY IN THE

01:42:47 ECONOMY, THIS IDEA OF AMPLE VERSUS ABUNDANT THAT THEY KEEP

01:42:51 TALKING ABOUT, THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE A 2018 CORRECTION IN

01:42:54 THIS MARKET.

01:42:58 >> ARE FINANCIAL CONDITIONS TIGHT OR EASY? I DON'T KNOW.

01:43:02 IS FED POLICY THAT TIGHT? WHERE ARE WE?

01:43:05 >> WE ARE 100% EASY. YOU DON'T SEE MARKETS LIKE THIS.

01:43:12 YOU DON'T SEE CREDIT SPREADS WHERE THEY ARE.

01:43:18 YOU DON'T SEE AUCTIONS GOING OFF WITHOUT A HITCH UNLESS

01:43:19 THERE ARE EASY FINANCIAL CONDITIONS.

01:43:22 >> THAT SAID, THEY ARE TIGHT FOR SOME PEOPLE, WHICH IS WHAT

01:43:26 WE HEARD FOR SMALLER BUSINESSES AND WHAT WE HEAR WHEN WE LOOK

01:43:28 AT DELINQUENCIES. HAVE YOU EVER FOUND THE ECONOMY

01:43:30 THIS CONFUSING?

01:43:32 >> NO. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS

01:43:37 HAPPENED, AND WE CAN TRACE IT BACK AS LONG AS THE PAST 15

01:43:40 YEARS OF WHAT ZERO INTEREST RATES HAVE WROUGHT, WHICH IS AN

01:43:43 EXTRAORDINARY DIVERSIONS BETWEEN THE HAVES AND HAVE NOTS.

01:43:51 SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, FOR THE WEALTHIER 40% OF THE

01:43:53 ECONOMY, HIGH RATES ARE

01:43:59 ACTUALLY INCOME PRODUCING, AND THAT'S BEEN STIMULATIVE.

01:44:04 FOR THOSE WHO NEED CREDIT, IT HAS BEEN A HEADWIND.

01:44:07 AND I THINK THAT DIVERGENCE IS GETTING BIGGER AND BIGGER,

01:44:13 WHICH IS WHY PEELING APART IN DECODING THE ECONOMY HERE IS

01:44:17 TOUGH, BECAUSE IF YOU ACTUALLY LOOK AT CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IN

01:44:20 THE AGGREGATE, IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S DRIFTING UP, BUT WHEN YOU

01:44:24 LOOK AT CONSUMER CONFIDENCE BY INCOME COHORT, THE LOWER TWO

01:44:28 THIRDS ARE SUFFERING AND SAYING THERE'S INFLATION.

01:44:30 THERE ARE HIGHER RATES. MY CREDIT CARD PAYMENTS ARE

01:44:33 GOING UP.

01:44:35 >> WHICH GOES TO WHAT YOU DO FROM AN INVESTMENT STANDPOINT

01:44:39 GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE FED HAS TO MAKE A CHOICE.

01:44:43 DO THEY TRY TO CURTAIL SOME OF THE GAINS IN MARKETS OR DO THEY

01:44:47 TRY TO THROW A BONE TO SOME OF THE LOWER INCOME SECTORS WHO

01:44:49 ARE STRUGGLING? IF THEY ERR ON THAT SIDE AND

01:44:57 CUT RATES, ARE THEY GOING TO TURBOCHARGE WHAT'S BEEN

01:44:58 BENEFITING THE UPPER CLASS FOR THE PAST YEAR OR LONGER THAN

01:45:01 THAT?

01:45:02 >> YES AND YES. I THINK THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE

01:45:06 BACKED THEMSELVES INTO A CORNER. I THINK THIS LACK OF STABILITY

01:45:10 IS GOING TO BE WITH US FOR A WHILE.

01:45:14 AND I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE A CLEAR STRATEGY FOR HOW TO

01:45:15 MANAGE IT.

01:45:17 >> SOME WORDS AND PHRASES YOU HAVE USED.

01:45:23 VIGILANCE, MAXIMUM ACTIVE MANAGEMENT, REDUCE EXPOSURE TO

01:45:24 THE CONSUMER. WHY DO YOU THINK MARGINS WILL

01:45:26 BE CHALLENGED SOON?

01:45:32 >> IF WE PEEL THINGS APART, YOU KNOW, THE OVERALL MARGIN

01:45:36 EXPANSION OF THE MAG SEVEN LAST YEAR WAS SPECTACULAR.

01:45:39 IT REALLY DROVE THE AGGREGATE MARKET CAP WEIGHTED INDEX,

01:45:42 REBOUNDED MARGINS. UNDERNEATH THAT, MARGINS ARE

01:45:49 BASICALLY WHERE THEY WERE PRE-COVID, WHICH SUGGESTS WE

01:45:52 ARE "NORMAL," BUT WE ARE NOT EXPANDING IT.

01:45:57 THE QUESTION WE HAVE FOR THAT COHORT, THE NON-MAG SEVEN

01:46:00 COHORT, IS WHERE IS MARGIN EXPANSION GOING TO COME FROM?

01:46:05 IT LOOKS BASED ON THE INFLATION DATA LIKE COSTS ARE GOING UP.

01:46:09 MANUFACTURED INPUT COSTS ARE GOING UP.

01:46:12 WE KNOW THE PPI HAS BEEN GOING UP. SO THAT'S A PRESSURE.

01:46:18 IT'S NOT CLEAR TO US THAT WHILE WE MAY SAY THAT WAGE GROWTH IS

01:46:24 DECELERATING, IT IS STILL OVER 4%, AND SO OUR CONTENTION IS,

01:46:27 WITHOUT A LOT OF TOPLINE GROWTH IN THE ECONOMY, WHICH WE MAY

01:46:33 GET FOR SOME CYCLICAL SECTORS, IT'S GOING TO BE HARD TO GET

01:46:34 MARGINS GOING.

01:46:38 >> CAN IT BE MADE UP WITH BETTER TOPLINE GROWTH?

01:46:41 IS THERE A BETTER WAY TO PLAY HIGHER NOMINAL GDP IN AMERICA,

01:46:45 OUTSIDE OF THE CONSUMER?

01:46:46 >> YES. OUR CONTENTION HAS BEEN THE

01:46:53 BEST WAY TO PLAY WHAT WE ARE SEEING NOW, A REBOUNDING GLOBAL

01:46:56 GROWTH AND MANUFACTURING GROWTH, IS WITH CYCLICALS,

01:47:03 INDUSTRIALS, ENERGY, MATERIALS, FINANCIALS, POTENTIALLY AWAY

01:47:06 FROM SOME OF THE MORE GENERAL RETAIL OR CONSUMER

01:47:07 DISCRETIONARY NAMES.

01:47:10 >> YOU POINT TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE MORE UPSIDE TO --

01:47:14 UPSIDE SURPRISES COMING FROM OUTSIDE THE U.S.

01:47:19 ARE YOU LIKING EMERGING MARKETS AND AREAS THAT ARE TYPICALLY

01:47:22 MORE LEVERAGED TO A MORE POSITIVE CYCLE EVEN THOUGH WE

01:47:24 MIGHT NOT BE HEADING TOWARD ONE? >> ABSOLUTELY.

01:47:29 ONE OF THE THINGS WE SPEND THE MOST TIME EDUCATING CLIENTS ON

01:47:34 NOW IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE ARE SEEING ALL-TIME HIGHS

01:47:37 OUTSIDE THE U.S., TELLING THEM THE STORY ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON

01:47:41 IN JAPAN, ABOUT THE REBOUND IN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION IN

01:47:44 GERMANY AFTER GERMANY'S LANGUISHED FOR THE LAST 18

01:47:48 MONTHS. IT'S AN INTERESTING STORY.

01:47:51 EUROPEAN MARKETS HAVE RESPONDED AND WE THINK THERE IS MORE

01:47:53 JUICE IN THAT LEMON. EMERGING MARKETS AS WELL.

01:47:58 EVEN IN CHINA COME AS NEGATIVE AS PEOPLE WANT TO BE ON CHINA

01:48:03 -- CHINA, AS NEGATIVE AS PEOPLE WANT TO BE ON CHINA, DOES LOOK

01:48:05 LIKE THERE'S IMPROVEMENT THAT'S POSITIVE.

01:48:10 >> ARE YOU MOVING MORE HEAVILY INTO EUROPE, INTO JAPAN, EVEN

01:48:12 CHINA, AND OUT OF THE U.S.? IS THAT THE WAY YOU ARE PLAYING

01:48:14 THIS?

01:48:18 >> WE ARE TRYING TO REBALANCE AND BE DIVERSIFIED AS PART OF

01:48:20 THE AGGRESSIVE ACTIVE MANAGEMENT.

01:48:24 LET'S BE MAXIMALLY DIVERSIFIED AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOME OF

01:48:28 THESE EMERGING TRENDS, WHICH INCLUDES NOT JUST MOVING BY

01:48:29 SECTOR BUT MOVING BY GEOGRAPHY.

01:48:30 >> YOU MENTIONED CHINA. ARE YOU TOURING OR IS IT A

01:48:33 DESTINATION?

01:48:36 >> CHINA CANNOT BE A DESTINATION FOR OUR CLIENTS

01:48:37 HERE. I THINK THE VOLATILITY OF POLICY AND GEOPOLITICS IS TOO

01:48:42 HOT.

01:48:50 SO WE HAVE BEEN FAVORING AN EM X CHINA PERSPECTIVE.

01:48:54 WE THINK THERE ARE GOOD OPPORTUNITIES IN PLACES LIKE

01:48:57 BRAZIL, MEXICO, INDIA.

01:49:01 >> TALKING ABOUT INDUSTRIALS, ENERGY, WHAT EXPOSURE IS IT?

01:49:06 IS IT THE COMPANIES YOU LIKE OR DO YOU LIKE THESE MATERIALS?

01:49:08 >> WE ARE OWNING BOTH. WE BELIEVE INFLATION WILL BE

01:49:11 STICKIER. WE HAVE OWNED THE UNDERLYING

01:49:13 COMMODITIES. THAT'S BEEN A DECENT TRADE AND

01:49:17 WE THINK WILL REMAIN ONE SO LONG AS GLOBAL GROWTH IS

01:49:20 IMPROVING. WE ALSO WANT TO PICK COMPANIES

01:49:25 THAT ARE GOING TO BEAT ESTIM
