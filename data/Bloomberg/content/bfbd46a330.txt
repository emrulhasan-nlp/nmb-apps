The latest political battleground over the US’s southern border is a small Texas city called Eagle Pass. The border town of roughly 30,000 people became a major passageway for illegal crossings in recent years. The Republican governor of Texas, Greg Abbott , says it’s an example of how his state is taking the brunt of failed immigration policies under President Joe Biden , a Democrat, amid record levels of illegal crossings. In response to the surge and in defiance of federal authority over immigration, Abbott in January ordered Texas National Guard troops to take control of Shelby Park, a key access point in Eagle Pass to the Rio Grande, which flows along a major part of the US-Mexico border. Those troops also barred federal agents from gaining access to the river.

US Customs and Border Protection is in charge of securing US borders at and between ports of entry. The agency, which is part of the Homeland Security Department, enforces policies decided by Congress. State government authority was historically limited to determining how much or how little benefits to offer to migrants living in their jurisdictions. But some border states have tried to expand their power over immigration. For example, in 2010 Arizona required police officers to demand immigration documents from anyone they suspected was in the country illegally. But key provisions of that law were overturned in court.
