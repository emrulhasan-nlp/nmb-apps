In recent months, Elon Musk has shown an openness to Donald Trump’s falsehoods that the 2020 election was stolen and that the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection was a government conspiracy. Musk has also promoted the far-right claim that White people are under threat from Black people and immigrants—popular racial fixations of some Trump supporters. This week, the Elon, Inc. podcast is joined by Bloomberg reporter Davey Alba to discuss how Musk is increasingly engaging with memes and falsehoods favored by Trump and his followers. The panel also breaks down the current drama over at Tesla.
