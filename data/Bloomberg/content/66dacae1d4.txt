00:13 >> THIS MARKET IS EXTREMELY PROFITABLE TO THE UPSIDE.

00:16 >> WHAT WE WILL SEE HERE IS A BROADENING OUT IN QUALITY

00:21 GROWTH.

00:22 >> WHAT HAPPENING -- WHAT HAPPENS HERE IS A BROADENING TO

00:25 AREAS THAT AREN'T AS RISKY AS WE THINK.

00:29 >> WE THINK THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SMALL-CAP TO

00:30 CATCH UP.

00:35 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE

00:37 WITH JONATHAN FERRO, LISA ABRAMOWICZ AND ANNMARIE HORDERN.

00:41 >> LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY, GOOD MORNING FOR AUDIENCE

00:42 WORLDWIDE.

00:48 THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE, I'M JONATHAN FERRO.

00:51 YOUR EQUITY MARKET ON THE S&P 500 TOTALLY UNCHANGED.

00:54 ON THE BOND MARKET SOME BIG MOVES.

01:00 27 BASIS POINTS HIGHER ON THE TWO-YEAR.

01:04 DEUTSCHE BANK OUT YESTERDAY DROPPING ITS RECESSION CALL

01:07 PRAYED THEY'VE HELD OUT SINCE APRIL OF 2022 GOING BACK TO

01:08 SOMETHING LIKE TWO YEARS. LISA: IT SEEMS LIKE A BASE CASE

01:14 TALKING ABOUT HOW THE FED CANNOT CUT RATES AS MANY TIMES

01:17 AS THEY PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT. THERE IS A NARRATIVE SHIFT

01:23 UNDERWAY THAT THE ECONOMY IS NOT SLOWING DOWN ENOUGH FOR IT

01:25 TO BECOME GOLDILOCKS.

01:26 RIGHT NOW FED RATES ARE NOT AS RESTRICTIVE AS SO MANY PEOPLE

01:32 EXPECTED. JONATHAN: WHEN I CAME IN THIS MORNING,

01:37 GOLDILOCKS IS ON LIFE SUPPORT. THE KIND OF MORNING WE WILL BE

01:41 HAVING. LET'S GO THROUGH SOME OF THE

01:44 CALLS FOR YOU. CONSIDERING UPSIDE RISK FOR

01:48 RATES. HSBC WE SEE RATE PRICING BEING

01:54 MORE PRONE TO UPSIDE THAN THE DOWNSIDE FOR NOW.

01:59 CONTRARY TO THE CONSENSUS NARRATIVE THE ECONOMY HAS NOT

02:02 YET MADE A SOFT LANDING AT IT LIKELY WILL NOT. LISA:

02:08 THIS ALSO SPEAKS TO WHY MATT AT DEUTSCHE BANK HAS A BASE CASE

02:13 FOR A NEUTRAL RATE OF 3.5 PERCENT AND POSSIBLY AS HIGH AS

02:14 4%. IT SPEAKS TO WHAT NEEL KASHKARI

02:16 WAS SAYING YESTERDAY WE ARE LOOKING AT A HIGHER NEUTRAL

02:21 RATE. HOW RESTRICTIVE IS THE FED FUNDS RATE WHEN YOU HAVE AN

02:26 ECONOMY THAT IF IT'S NOT SLOWING DOWN IT COULD EVEN BE

02:27 ACCELERATED. JONATHAN: JUST PHENOMENAL.

02:33 LISA: GIVEN THE FACT HEADLINE FIGURES

02:36 WERE GREATER THAN EXPECTED BUT PRICES PAID SEARCH THE MOST

02:39 GOING BACK TO AUGUST OF 2012. IT'S THE RED SEA DISRUPTIONS,

02:44 THE FACT THINGS ARE GETTING MORE EXPENSIVE.

02:49 >> IT ALL SOUNDS PRETTY BLEAK SO FORGIVE US.

02:51 GOLDILOCKS ON LIFE SUPPORT. A BILL IN D.C.

02:55 THAT'S APPARENTLY DEAD ON ARRIVAL. ANNMARIE:

02:58 IT POTENTIALLY IS ON LIFE SUPPORT AS WELL.

03:02 BILL REPUBLICAN JAMES LANKFORD WHO AUTHORED PART OF THIS BILL

03:05 SAYS HE'S NOT WILLING TO HOLD ITS FUNERAL JUST YET.

03:10 WHAT WE KNOW FROM BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, A PUNCH BOWL HAD A GREAT

03:12 REPORT SAYING WHAT MITCH MCCONNELL HAS SAID WHO

03:16 CONTINUES TO BACK THIS BILL IS SAYING THE POLITICAL MOOD HAS

03:17 CHANGED.

03:18 SO IF THIS DRAGS ON FOR MUCH LONGER, POTENTIALLY WE COULD

03:23 SEE THEM COME AROUND. A LOT OF CARRYING OF GRIEVANCES

03:28 OUT LOUD IN WASHINGTON DC. LISA: I AM SO DEEPLY FRUSTRATED BY

03:32 THIS STORY. IT FEELS LIKE A GAME OF

03:35 POLITICAL CHECKERS AND IT'S NOT THE REAL ISSUES THAT HAVE TO

03:41 GET DEALT WITH WITCHES INTERNATIONAL INVOLVEMENT OF

03:42 THE UNITED STATES AND WHAT CAN HAPPEN WITH BORDER PATROL.

03:45 THESE ARE THE ISSUES WE NEED TO HAVE CONVERSATION WITH.

03:48 THIS IS WHO PUTS US IN A BETTER POSITION.

03:54 >> THIS IS WHY PEOPLE HATE WASHINGTON DC AND POLITICIANS.

03:56 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GOOD POLITICS AND POLICY. ANNMARIE:

04:02 I WOULDN'T SAY. GOING BACK TO WHAT TERRY HAINES

04:05 SAID YESTERDAY A 60% CHANCE IT GETS DONE.

04:11 WE POTENTIALLY WEEKS AND MONTHS GO BY THERE COULD BE SOMETHING

04:12 TO GO AROUND. THIS IS HOW WASHINGTON WORKS,

04:17 NO DEAL UNTIL THERE IS A DEAL.

04:22 >> LET'S TURN TO THE PRICE ACTION ON THE S&P 500 TOTALLY

04:24 UNCHANGED. WHAT A MOVE WE'VE SEEN IN THE

04:27 PREVIOUS TWO DAYS. THE TWO-YEAR AT 446.

04:34 THE 10-YEAR AT 4.16. LISA: WHAT I FIND FASCINATING IS IT'S

04:39 NOT JUST THE TWO AND FED EXPECTATIONS IT'S A LONG-TERM

04:44 RATE FOR THE 10 YEAR. THE BIGGEST INCREASE IN YIELDS

04:48 FOR THE TENURE GOING BACK TO 2022. THAT I THINK IS REALLY

04:53 COMPELLING FOR ASSET CLASSES.

05:00 JONATHAN: 1.0730 IS WHERE THE EURO IS

05:04 SPREAD WALL STREET PULLING BACK CALLS, JOHN LEVER OF EURASIA

05:09 GROUP. THE SENATE ON THE VERGE OF

05:13 COLLAPSE AND JEANNIE CORONADO AS THE FED CONTINUES TO PUSH

05:14 BACK ITS FIRST RATE CUT. WE BEGIN WITH OUR TOP STORY, A

05:20 SERIES OF UPSIDE SURPRISES ON WALL STREET.

05:23 LARRY ADAM OF RAYMOND JAMES EXPECTS THE MARKET TO CONTINUE.

05:26 SAYING WE ARE 1.3 YEARS INTO THIS BOND MARKET VERSUS THE

05:30 AVERAGE BULL MARKET OF 5.5. WE STILL SEE UPSIDE LONGER-TERM.

05:34 LARRY JOINS US NOW FOR MORE. LET'S GET STRAIGHT INTO THE

05:36 DATA. JOBS DATA BLOWOUT REPORT ON

05:40 FRIDAY. ASSET SERVICES LOOKING TREMENDOUS.

05:44 HOW MUCH WEIGHT ARE YOU PUTTING ON THAT DATA?

05:49 >> IT'S IMPORTANT DATA WE CONTINUE TO GET.

05:51 WE ARE STILL SKEPTICAL ABOUT SOME OF THOSE JOBS NUMBERS.

05:56 IT DOESN'T COMPLY WITH WHAT AMERICA JUST CORPORATE AMERICA

05:57 IS TALKING ABOUT. YOU'RE SEEING A LOT OF LAYOFFS

05:59 TAKING PLACE. I WOULD SAY WITH THOSE STRONG

06:04 NUMBERS IF THEY CONTINUE TO COME IT DOES NARROW THAT PATH

06:07 OF US THINKING WE WILL GO INTO A RECESSION BECAUSE

06:11 HISTORICALLY TO GET A RECESSION YOU NEED TO LOSE ABOUT ONE

06:13 MILLION JOBS. IF YOU SEE THAT STRONG GROWTH

06:16 YOU PROBABLY WON'T SEE THAT LOSS IN JOBS THIS YEAR AND YOU

06:19 COULD GET THAT SOFT LANDING WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR. LISA:

06:23 THERE'S BEEN THIS FEELING THE

06:25 ECONOMY IS STRONG, WHEN DO YOU START RECONSIDERING WHAT

06:29 RESTRICTIVE MEANS. WHAT THE NEUTRAL RATE IS.

06:33 HOW DOES THAT FACTOR INTO YOUR THESIS? LARRY:

06:38 GOOD NEWS IS ALWAYS GOOD NEWS. WE'VE BASE CASE FOR THE EQUITY

06:41 MARKET WILL GO.

06:48 IF THE FED WERE TO AVERT A RECESSION, THERE'S A LOT OF

06:50 UPSIDE RISK TO THE FORECAST. GOOD NEWS IS GOOD NEWS.

06:55 IF WE WERE HIT A RECESSION THAT PROBABLY TAKES THE EARNINGS

06:58 FORECAST HIGHER AND TAKES THE PRICE OF THE EQUITY MARKET

07:00 HIGHER. THAT'S ALWAYS A GOOD THING WHEN

07:02 YOU SEE THIS GOOD NEWS LONGER-TERM.

07:07 >> A LOT OF ANALYSTS PARSING THROUGH WHY THE ANALYST -- WHY

07:09 THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER REGIONS.

07:11 OUR PEOPLE POINTING TO STIMULUS AND THE FACT THAT IT'S STILL

07:15 COMING. HOW MUCH IS THAT TIED TO U.S.

07:18 INDUSTRIAL POLICY AND THE FACT THAT WILL BE A BOATLOAD MORE OF

07:22 MONEY FLOODING INTO THE SECTOR. LARRY:

07:27 WE BELIEVE IN THAT INDUSTRIAL RENAISSANCE THAT'S TAKEN PLACE.

07:30 IF YOU LOOK AT THE MONEY SET ASIDE WHETHER IT'S THE CHIPS

07:35 ACT, THE AMERICAN RECOVERY ACT, THERE STILL TENS OF BILLIONS OF

07:39 DOLLARS SITTING ON THE SIDELINES TO BRING THAT

07:41 MANUFACTURING TO THE U.S. AND THAT'S THE REASON WHY WE

07:43 BELIEVE INDUSTRIALS WOULD DO WELL FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

07:49 >> WHAT IF THIS LEADS TO A PERSISTENT REPRICING AND

07:51 INTEREST RATES AND REPRICING INTEREST RATES HIGHER.

07:54 CAN YOU EXPLORE THAT SCENARIO WITH US.

07:56 IF THAT HAPPENS WHAT AREAS RIGHT NOW ARE MOST VULNERABLE?

08:04 LARRY: IF INTEREST RATES MOVE HIGHER

08:06 THAT WILL WAIVE ON THE EQUITY MARKETS.

08:10 OUR FORECAST INTEREST RATES GO LOWER BECAUSE WE SEE A SOFT

08:11 BATCH IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PART OF THE YEAR.

08:14 ONE AREA WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK HIGHER INTEREST RATES ARE

08:17 GOING AS FAR AS THE MEGA TECH -- MAKE CAP TECH STOCKS.

08:22 WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT FROM THE BEGINNING THAT THESE

08:25 FOR THE MOST PART HAVE BEEN INSULATED FROM THE HIGHER

08:28 INTEREST RATES. THAT TENDS TO BE BETTER GROWTH

08:32 AND CREDIT GROWTH DRIVES THOSE SECTORS OF THE MARKET.

08:35 WHERE I'M WORRIED INTEREST RATES GO HIGHER IS

08:37 INTEREST-RATE SENSITIVE SECTORS. YOUR CONSUMER STAPLES, THOSE

08:41 WILL BE MORE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED IF YOU SEE THOSE

08:45 HIGHER RATES.

08:47 >> WHEN IT COMES TO FINANCIALS, THE BANKS.

08:49 >> I THINK THEY'RE IN GOOD SHAPE.

08:52 IT'S ALWAYS INTERESTING WHEN YOU SEE THESE HEADLINES ABOUT

08:55 THE POSSIBILITY OF A BANK GOING UNDER.

09:01 KEEP IN MIND REGIONAL BANKS ARE 1% OF THE S&P 500.

09:03 IT'S A VERY SMALL PORTION OF IT. IF YOU LOOK AT WITHIN THE S&P

09:08 500 IT WILL BE A BIG CAP BANK STOCKS.

09:11 IT WILL BE INSURANCE COMPANIES. FOR THE MOST PART THEY CONTINUE

09:15 TO DO WELL AS WE'VE COME THROUGH EARNINGS SEASON.

09:19 THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT AN UPTICK IN CAPITAL MARKET

09:20 ACTIVITY THIS YEAR. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED

09:24 YESTERDAY IN THE SURVEY THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT MORE BANKS

09:28 GETTING LENDING OUT THERE LOOKING FOR MORE DEMAND.

09:32 I THINK THERE'S AN ABILITY IN EARNINGS FOR THE BIG BANKS

09:34 GOING FORWARD IS STILL PRETTY SOLID.

09:38 >> WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW THE SENIOR LOAN OFFICER, I WAS

09:43 READING IT AND THINKING THIS ISN'T INTERESTING AT ALL.

09:46 THIS IS GIVING US NO INFORMATION.

09:50 IT SPEAKS TO EXACTLY WHAT LARRY IS TALKING ABOUT.

09:53 YOU SAID YOU'RE EXPECTING A SOFT PATCH PRAYED I'M NOT

09:54 SEEING THAT. DOES THAT MAKE YOU MORE BULLISH

09:56 OR BEARISH.

10:02 >> IT MAKES US MORE OPTIMISTIC BECAUSE WHAT THAT WILL DO IS

10:04 INCREASE EARNINGS AND OBVIOUSLY LIFT OUR TARGET ON THE S&P 500.

10:09 HISTORICALLY WHEN THESE RECESSIONS COME ABOUT THEY COME

10:10 ABOUT QUICKLY. YOU LOOK AT THE LAST 12

10:17 RECESSIONS, THE CORNER BEFORE THIS RECESSION OCCURS GDP

10:19 GROWTH IS AROUND 2.6%. THE NEXT QUARTER WHEN YOU GET A

10:23 RECESSION, GROWTH FALLS VERY QUICKLY.

10:27 IT CAN HAPPEN VERY QUICKLY.

10:32 >> THIS IS REALLY SOMETHING PEOPLE USED TO SAY A LOT IS

10:34 HIGHER RATES WILL MAKE STOCKS REPRICE LOWER.

10:36 WHAT IS THE RATE AT WHICH YOU GET UNCOMFORTABLE WITH STOCK

10:40 VALUATIONS. IS THERE A YIELD THAT GIVES YOU

10:43 A LITTLE THANKS.

10:45 >> I THINK IT'S TWO THINGS. I THINK IT'S THE LEVEL AND THE

10:48 TIME. , WE WERE ON THE SHOW ONCE BEFORE AND WE DID 5% WITH THE

10:55 10-YEAR TREASURY YIELD. AT THAT LEVEL THAT REALLY

11:00 STARTS TO SLOW DOWN THE ECONOMY QUITE A BIT AND WE WERE SEEING

11:02 THAT BECAUSE NOT ONLY WAS IT IMPACTING THE HOUSING MARKET

11:08 BUT YOU ARE SEEING A LOT OF COMPANIES NOT GO INTO THE

11:09 MARKET TO GET ADDITIONAL FUNDING.

11:13 AS THAT'S FALLEN PRETTY QUICKLY YOU SEE A RESURGENCE IN

11:16 CORPORATE ACTIVITY WHICH IS GOING TO HELP SUPPORT THIS

11:19 ECONOMY. I THINK IF YOU GET UP TO THAT

11:22 5% LEVEL I THINK THAT THAT DOES START TO CRIMP THE ECONOMY.

11:28 JONATHAN: I REMEMBER LAST SPRING THE ONLY

11:32 THING THAT MATTERED WERE PAYROLLS, NOT CPI.

11:37 THE SENIOR LOAN OFFICER OPINION SURVEY, WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT

11:39 IT AT ALL. I CAN GIVE YOU THE LEAD

11:41 PARAGRAPH IN CASE YOU MISSED IT. U.S.

11:45 BANKS REPORTED STRICTER CREDIT STANDINGS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER

11:48 ALTHOUGH THE PROPORTION OF THOSE STANDARDS SHRANK.

11:53 IT'S GETTING TIGHTER, JUST NOT AS TIGHT AS BEFORE.

11:57 >> THEY ARE KIND OF SLOWING THE PACE OF HOW THEY AND BASICALLY

11:59 IT'S NOT THAT BAD. PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO EXTEND

12:01 THAT CREDIT. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THIS

12:05 IT'S NOT IT.

12:08 >> IT DIDN'T LEAD TO THIS LENDING STANDARDS THAT WOULD

12:09 TIP OVER. WE GO BACK TO THE DEUTSCHE BANK

12:11 CALL. THIS WAS THEIR OUTLOOK.

12:17 RATES OF RISE BETWEEN 5% AND 6% ON FED FUNDS. GREAT CALL.

12:23 SIGNIFICANT RECESSION BY LATE 2023.

12:26 THAT WAS ULTIMATELY THE VIEW WE SEE A LITTLE BIT OF PAIN IN THE

12:30 LABOR MARKET GETTING INFLATION DOWN TOWARDS TARGET.

12:35 SPRING OF LAST YEAR THE BANKING STRESSED LENDING STANDARDS.

12:38 HERE WE ARE AGAINST OUR 2024. THEY WILL CUT INTEREST RATES IN

12:42 MARCH PRAYED GRADE DATA TO KICK OFF THE YEAR.

12:45 TO YOUR POINT YOU CAN JUST FEEL THE CONVERSATION SLIGHTLY

12:48 TURNING. I THINK YOU NEED ANOTHER MONTH

12:51 OR TWO MONTHS OF THE SAME DATA SO FAR TO REALLY CHANGE

12:52 PEOPLE'S THOUGHTS ON THIS. YOU CAN SEE THE DIRECTION IT'S

12:54 GOING IN. LISA: PEOPLE ARE STILL SAYING IT'S

13:00 EARLY BUT THERE IS THIS POSSIBILITY WE REVERSE THIS AND

13:03 GET A REPEAT WHERE THE ECONOMY IS BETTER THAN EXPECTED.

13:05 AND EVERYONE CHUGS ALONG WITH INVENTORY. JONATHAN:

13:12 NO LENDING LAST YEAR IN FEBRUARY. LISA:

13:15 WE ARE IN FEBRUARY SO NO LANDING. HOVERING. JONATHAN:

13:19 EVERYTHING SEEMS TO REPEAT IN THIS MARKET.

13:22 WHAT YOU CALL IT, NARRATIVE ROULETTE? LISA:

13:25 THAT WAS VERY WELL SAID. JONATHAN:

13:28 NARRATIVE TABLE TENNIS. LET'S GET YOU AN UPDATE ON

13:31 STORIES THIS MORNING. DANI: SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCES

13:39 HEAVY RAIN AND FLOODING THANKS TO A POWERFUL PACIFIC STORM

13:42 REID THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE SAYS RAIN IS EXPECTED

13:45 TO TAPER OFF TODAY ALL THE FLOODING AND MUDSLIDES REMAIN A

13:50 RISK AS THE STORM MOVES EAST. THE SO-CALLED ATMOSPHERIC RAIN

13:54 DUMPING 10 INCHES OF RAIN CAUSING $11 BILLION OF DAMAGE.

14:00 SHARES OF PALANTIR ARE SOARING AFTER THE COMPANY GAINED A

14:02 HIGHER-THAN-EXPECTED PROFIT OUTLOOK DRIVEN BY AI DEMAND.

14:08 THE CEO TOLD BLOOMBERG THEY ARE REBUILDING TO MATCH THE SEARCH.

14:12 THEY ALSO MARKED THE FIRST YEAR EVER BEING PROFITABLE WITH NET

14:16 INCOME AT $210 MILLION. USERS OF APPLE'S VISION PRO ARE

14:22 DISCOVERING THE PAIN OF LOSING THEIR PASSCODE.

14:23 THE COMPANY TELLING USERS THEY WILL HAVE TO BRING THE DEVICE

14:31 BACK INTO THE STORE OR MAIL IT IF THE DEVICE IS DISABLED AFTER

14:36 ENTERING PASSCODE INCORRECTLY TOO MANY TIMES.

14:40 IT IS APPLE'S MAJOR HARDWARE CATEGORY IN A MUST A DECADE.

14:42 JONATHAN: HAVE YOU SEEN A VISION PRO IN

14:45 THE WILD? DANI:

14:51 I WENT TO THE APPLE STORE AND SAID CAN I DEMO THIS THING AND

14:53 THEY SAID THE WAITLIST IS THREE DAYS LONG. ANNMARIE:

14:59 THREE DAYS TO TRY A $3500 PRODUCT?

15:02 WHEN YOU ADD IN POTENTIALLY MORE STORAGE SPACE, THE KIT TO

15:05 CARRY AROUND, THAT'S WHAT MOST AVERAGE AMERICANS MAKE IT A

15:09 MONTH. JONATHAN: I'VE SEEN THE VIDEO OF PEOPLE

15:13 WALKING AROUND IN THE CITY. THAT'S NOT THE FUTURE I WANT

15:16 PRAYED -- I WANT. LISA: IT'S THE FUTURE MY OLDEST SON

15:19 WAS TALKING ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

15:25 SAYING YOU DO NOT NEED AN IPAD CORA DUST, YOU CAN SUPERIMPOSE

15:28 -- YOU DO NOT NEED AN IPAD. YOU CAN SUPERIMPOSE YOUR EYES.

15:36 JONATHAN: NOW KIDS WANT A $3500 VISION

15:37 PRO.

15:38 UP NEXT ON THE PROGRAM, PRESIDENT BIDEN MAKING A PLAY

15:49 TO CONGRESS.

15:52 >> PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT THE SENATE IS DOING.

16:00 IT GIVES US CONTROL AND STILL MEETS THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE

16:03 LEGALLY COMING ACROSS. JONATHAN: YOU ARE WATCHING BLOOMBERG

16:07 SURVEILLANCE.

16:27 JONATHAN: BEGINNING THE WEEK BY PULLING

16:30 BACK FROM ALL-TIME HIGHS ON THE S&P 500.

16:37 YIELDS UNCHANGED, ANYTHING BUT UNCHANGED OVER THE PREVIOUS

16:38 NEXT SESSIONS.

16:45 RIGHT NOW THIS MORNING THE 10 YEAR 4.1559.

16:47 PRESIDENT BIDEN MAKING A PLEA TO CONGRESS.

16:53 >> PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT THE SENATE IS DOING.

16:57 YOU GOT A BIPARTISAN DEALS AND WE SEE THAT THIS WEEK.

17:04 THE BIPARTISAN BILL GIVES US CONTROL AND STILL MEETS THE

17:08 NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE WHO ILLEGALLY COME ACROSS.

17:11 SHUTTING DOWN THE ONES NOT COMING THROUGH THE POINTS OF

17:15 ENTRY. JONATHAN: GOP SUPPORT SOURING ON A DEAL

17:18 TO IMPOSE NEW U.S. BORDER RESTRICTIONS AND THE

17:20 LOCKE UKRAINE AID. THE PLANNED VOTE IS TOO SOON

17:26 WITH TOP GOP NEGOTIATOR JAMES LANKFORD SINGH THE LEGISLATION

17:29 IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. DIRECTOR FOR THE UNITED STATES

17:33 EURASIA GROUP AND FORMER POLICY ADVISOR TO MITCH MCCONNELL

17:36 JOINS US NOW. HOW NARROW IS THE PATH TO GET

17:40 THIS BILL THROUGH CONGRESS?

17:43 >> RIGHT NOW I DON'T THINK THERE IS ONE.

17:47 THIS BILL HAS BEEN REJECTED OUTRIGHT BY THE HOUSE OF

17:49 REPRESENTATIVES AND THAT'S THE KEY QUESTION.

17:52 A LOT OF SENATORS WOULD BE WILLING TO VOTE FOR THE DEAL IF

17:54 THEY THOUGHT IT COULD BECOME LAW.

17:57 BUT THE HOUSE IS TELLING THEM THERE'S NO CHANCE THIS BECOMES

17:59 LAW BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY AREN'T READY TO LEGISLATE AROUND THE

18:01 BORDER. THAT'S A REALLY NARROW PATH

18:05 EVEN IF THE SENATE DID MANAGE TO PASS SOMETHING THIS WEEK

18:08 WHICH IS LOOKING LESS AND LESS LIKELY.

18:12 INSTEAD ARRIVAL IN THE HOUSE WHICH MEANS THERE'S NO PATH

18:17 FORWARD.

18:18 >> SENATOR JAMES LANKFORD SAID HE'S NOT PREPARED TO HOLD A

18:19 FUNERAL YET. WE'VE SEEN IN WASHINGTON TAKE

18:23 -- THINGS TAKE A REALLY LONG TIME.

18:24 DO YOU THINK IT'S SOME POINT THEY WOULD HAVE TO COALESCE

18:27 AROUND TO DEAL. THERE IS STILL UKRAINE AID THAT

18:29 NEEDS TO GET DONE.

18:35 >> THERE'S A LOT OF INTERESTING UKRAINE AID AMONG REPUBLICANS

18:36 AND DEMOCRATS IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE AND IF YOU PUT A PLANE

18:42 UKRAINE BILL ON THE FLOOR IT WOULD CERTAINLY PASS, BUT THE

18:46 ISSUE IS HOW DO YOU GET THAT BILL TO THE FLOOR.

18:50 THERE ARE STILL OTHER VEHICLES OUT THERE.

18:52 YOU HAVE TO FUND THE GOVERNMENT BY MARCH 8, OF THIS BORDER

18:56 TRADE FOR UKRAINE DEAL WAS ORIGINALLY PRESIDENT BIDEN'S

19:00 IDEA THAT WAS EMBRACED PER PUBLICAN LEADERSHIP BUT THE

19:03 BORDER DEAL WAS JUST A BAD TRADE-OFF BECAUSE REPUBLICANS

19:04 AREN'T INTERESTED IN DOING THE BORDER.

19:07 UKRAINE HAS OTHER PATHS, IT'S NOT QUITE DEAD YET.

19:15 THE BORDER CONTINUES TO BE A BRIDGE TOO FAR FOR U.S.

19:17 POLITICIANS PRAYED ANNMARIE: BIDEN LINK THEM BECAUSE OF

19:20 PRESSURE FROM REPUBLICANS. AT SOME POINT OUR VOTERS GOING

19:23 TO BLAME REPUBLICANS IF THIS DEAL DOES NOT GET DONE.

19:28 >> UNFORTUNATELY FOR BIDEN THE INCUMBENT TENDS TO GET BLAMED

19:30 FOR THINGS HAPPENING IN THE WORLD AND THE SITUATION ON THE

19:34 BORDER IS SOMETHING BIDEN IS CARRYING NOW.

19:38 IN MANY WAYS REPUBLICANS REJECTING THIS BILL WHICH

19:40 ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE A REASONABLE COMPROMISE THAT'S TO

19:44 THE RIGHT OF WHERE DEMOCRATS WOULD HAVE BEEN FIVE YEARS AGO

19:48 HELPS BIDEN PIN THE BLAME ON HIM, IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF

19:50 INSIDE BASEBALL FOR BIDEN TO MAKE.

19:53 HE'S THE INCUMBENT PRESIDENT AND TAKES RESPONSIBLE FOR

19:54 WHAT'S GOING ON. LISA:

20:01 I'M GETTING INCREASINGLY FRUSTRATED ABOUT THIS

20:02 NEGOTIATION BECAUSE IT FEELS LIKE POLITICAL CHECKERS AND WE

20:04 ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE ACTUAL ISSUES AND WHAT NEEDS TO

20:08 GET DONE AND IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THERE'S AN HONEST MEETING

20:12 OF THE MINDS. YOU'VE WORKED FOR MANY

20:14 DIFFERENT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, HOW DIFFERENT IS IT TODAY THEN

20:17 SAY EVEN FIVE OR 10 YEARS AGO?

20:22 >> THE DIFFERENCE MAY 15 YEARS AGO IS THERE WERE BAD FAITH

20:28 ACTORS TRYING TO COMPROMISE 15 YEARS AGO, THERE JUST WEREN'T

20:29 THAT MANY OF THEM AND THEY DID NOT HAVE THE MEGAPHONE TODAY.

20:35 NOW THOSE BAD FAITH ACTORS HAVE GROWN UP TO JUST ATTACK

20:38 ANYTHING THAT MOVES AND THAT'S THEIR ONLY INSTINCT IS TO SAY

20:42 NO AND THEY BENEFIT BY TAKING ON THE ESTABLISHMENT AS THEY

20:45 CALL IT AN THEY CAN FUND RAISE OFF OF IT, THEY CAN BE ON

20:50 SOCIAL MEDIA OFF OF IT AND THEY REJECTED THIS BILL EVEN BEFORE

20:51 THEY KNEW WHAT WAS IN IT. IT'S A DIFFICULT TO GET

20:54 ANYTHING DONE. IT'S FRUSTRATING TO WATCH

20:58 BECAUSE IT MEANS WE WILL HAVE THIS CONTINUED CRISES ON THE

20:59 SOUTHERN BORDER. JUST FINGER POINTING TO THE

21:03 OTHER SIDE. LISA:

21:09 A QUESTION OF UKRAINE AID PASSING.

21:10 35% CHANCE OF THE TAX BILL PASSING ALONGSIDE IT.

21:16 CAN YOU EXTRAPOLATE OUT IF YOU ARE CURRENTLY SENIOR ECONOMIC

21:19 ADVISOR TO MITCH MCCONNELL WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IS THE POTENTIAL

21:23 CONSEQUENCE OF NOT HAVING ACTION ?

21:28 >> THIS TAX BILL IS A MOSCOW -- MODEL STIMULUS FOR NEXT YEAR,

21:31 IT'S A SIZABLE TAX CUT FOR CORPORATIONS.

21:35 IRONICALLY THE TAX CUT FOR CORPORATIONS IS ONE THAT IS A

21:41 TAX INCREASE REPUBLICANS PUT IN PLACE TO FUND THE REDUCTION OF

21:44 A CORPORATE TAX RATE IN 2017 SO THEY ARE TRYING TO UNDO PIECE

21:45 OF THEIR OWN BILL. THAT BILL PROBABLY COULD GO

21:50 AWAY AND THERE WOULD BE SOME UNHAPPY CORPORATE LOBBYISTS BUT

21:56 THE UKRAINE AID IS A BIG DEAL AND UKRAINE IS FIGHTING A FIGHT

21:59 AGAINST AN AGGRESSIVE NEIGHBOR THAT LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE POISED

22:03 TO MAKE SOME GAINS THIS YEAR IF THEY CAN GET THIS MONEY.

22:06 IF WASHINGTON CAN CONTINUE TO GET SUPPORT FOR ITS ALLIES THIS

22:12 IS A SIGNAL PEOPLE LIKE CHINA, NORTH KOREA, IRAN AND RUSSIA

22:15 WILL TAKE AND INTERPRET AS WASHINGTON'S WEAKNESS.

22:16 IT WILL SHOW HOW THE DYSFUNCTION IS UNDERMINING

22:19 AMERICA'S GLOBAL LEADERSHIP GOAL.

22:24 I'M SURE THOSE MEMOS OF CONGERS AGREE WITH ME, IT'S JUST THIS

22:30 MORASS THEY ARE STUCK IN WHERE THEY CAN GET ANYTHING DONE.

22:33 JONATHAN: I'M PLEASED TO JOIN US BECAUSE

22:34 I KNOW YOU CAN ANSWER THIS QUESTION.

22:39 IN THIS BILL SOME CONSERVATORS ARE POINTING TO ONE SPECIFIC

22:40 PASSAGE WHICH SEEMS TO IMPLY ACCORDING TO THEM YOU WOULD

22:44 ALLOW 5000 BORDER CROSSINGS EVERY SINGLE DAY BEFORE

22:46 SHUTTING DOWN THE BORDER. I KNOW IT'S NOT THAT

22:48 STRAIGHTFORWARD. CAN YOU TELL US WHAT ACTUALLY

22:51 SAYS AND MEANS?

22:54 >> IT'S A PRETTY CONVOLUTED PROVISION.

22:59 IF SENATOR MCCONNELL OR LANGFORD WERE DRAFTING THE BILL

23:01 ON THEIR OWN THIS IS NOT WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE.

23:05 ONCE ILLEGAL CROSSINGS PASS 5000 A DAY THEY CAN SHUT DOWN

23:12 THE BORDER WHICH MEANS NO MORE ASYLUM-SEEKERS OR BARELY ANY

23:13 ASYLUM-SEEKERS AND EMPOWERS THEM TO RATCHET UP ENFORCEMENT

23:15 ON THE SOUTHERN BORDER. THIS IS NOT LETTING IN 5000

23:21 PEOPLE A DAY IT IS MAKING ENFORCEMENT MUCH STRICTER ACE

23:23 ON THE CURRENT CONDITIONS ON THE BORDER AND SHUTTING DOWN

23:28 THE ASYLUM PATHS WHICH ARE ONE MAJOR WAY THAT PEOPLE ARE

23:30 CROSSING INTO THE UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW.

23:35 I WOULD SEND A SIGNAL TO OTHER MIGRANTS TRYING TO GET TO THE

23:36 U.S. BORDER THAT THEY BETTER STOP

23:37 COMING. I AGREE WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN IT

23:44 GIVES THEM SOME POWER AND ALSO EMPOWERS A FUTURE PRESIDENT

23:47 TRUMP IF HE WINS OFFICE. THIS IS CLEARLY A WIN FOR

23:50 PEOPLE HORSE -- CONCERNED ABOUT THE BORDER. JONATHAN:

23:54 I CAN SENSE THE FRUSTRATION ACROSS THE DESK ON THIS ISSUE.

23:56 LISA: THE ISSUE IS YOU CAN DEBATE THE

24:02 INSIDES OF THIS BILL, WHETHER IT IS VALOR NOT, WHETHER IT IS

24:05 EFFECTIVE OR NOT, WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THAT DEBATE.

24:08 DON'T HAVE A DEBATE OF WHO HELPS AND WHAT IT MEANS IN

24:12 TERMS OF POPULARITY CONTESTS THAT'S GOOD HAPPEN AT SOME

24:16 POINT. JONATHAN: POLICY VERSUS POLITICS.

24:18 IN AN ELECTION YEAR. THE OUTLOOK FOR EUROPEAN BANKS

24:25 AS UBS LOOKS TO MOVE BEYOND ITS TAKEOVER OF CREDIT SUISSE.

24:29 EQUITY FUTURES JUST A TOUCH NEGATIVE ON THE S&P.

24:31 FROM NEW YORK CITY, THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

24:48 JONATHAN: IS GOOD NEWS TRULY GOOD NEWS?

24:53 WE WILL TRY TO FIGURE THIS OUT ON THE EQUITY MARKET THE S&P

24:57 500 SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE ON FUTURES.

24:59 POSITIVE ON THE NASDAQ BY .16%. YESTERDAY THE SERVICES READ

25:02 LOOK TREMENDOUS. DELIVERING THE BIGGEST GAIN IN

25:05 ABOUT A YEAR. FUTURE DEMAND RISING TO A

25:10 THREE-MONTH HIGH LOOKING DECENT AS WELL.

25:14 PRICES PAID BUT CLIMBED. TWO-YEAR, 10 YEAR, 10 YEAR

25:18 YIELDS HIGHER. TWO-YEAR YIELDS HIGHER.

25:23 NOW A LITTLE BIT LOWER BY A SINGLE BASIS POINT OR TWO. LISA:

25:27 PEOPLE THINKING HOW MUCH CAN THE FED CUT RATES AT A TIME

25:32 WHEN YOU ARE SEEING SIGNS THERE'S A REAL ACCELERATION OF

25:36 THE ECONOMY. KEY QUESTION KEEPS BEING WHEN

25:39 DOES HIGHER YIELDS HIGHER FOR LONGER BITE THE ECONOMY.

25:42 JONATHAN: ARE WE SUFFICIENTLY RESTRICTIVE

25:46 BASED ON THE DATA YESTERDAY. LISA:

25:52 OTHER PEOPLE ARE SAYING MAYBE WE HAVE TO REASSESS. JONATHAN:

25:55 DOLLAR INDEX YESTERDAY CLIMBING TO THE STRONGEST LEVELS SINCE

25:57 MID-NOVEMBER. THE EURO BREAKING DOWN HERE.

26:03 1.0733. LET'S BEGIN WITH OUR TOP STORIES.

26:09 A SENATE DEAL TO IMPOSE U.S. BORDER RESTRICTIONS AND AID FOR

26:11 UKRAINE IS ON THE BRINK OF COLLAPSE. REPUBLICAN SENATOR SAY

26:16 WEDNESDAY VOTE WOULD BE TOO SOON.

26:19 IT WOULD CRACKDOWN ON ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS AND SPEED UP

26:21 DEPORTATIONS OF MIGRANTS.

26:27 GOP PRESIDENTIAL FRONT-RUNNER DONALD TRUMP REJECTING THE BILL

26:30 AND LEADERSHIP IN THE HOUSE CALLING IT DEAD ON ARRIVAL.

26:33 FOR THOSE OF YOU AT HOME WHO THINK MAYBE FINANCIAL

26:37 JOURNALISTS, TAKE A LISTEN TO POLITICO THIS MORNING.

26:39 THE SUBJECT OF THE MORNING NOTE, EVERYTHING IS DEBT

26:42 APPARENTLY. ANNMARIE: THE REPUBLICAN AUTHOR OF THE

26:49 BILL SAID HE'S NOT RUNNING TO HOLD -- JUST YET.

26:52 THIS IS THE POLITICS OF THIS BUILDER GOT TRICKY TO SIGN UP

26:55 FOR A MOTION OF CLOTURE ON IT TOMORROW.

26:59 PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS THIS BILL IS A GREAT BILL TO THE DEMOCRAT

27:04 AND A DEATH WISH TO THEIR PUBLICAN PARTY.

27:07 IMMIGRATION HAS BECOME A BIGGER ISSUE HEADING INTO NOVEMBER.

27:10 THE ECONOMY IS BETTER ACCORDING TO OUR POLLING.

27:13 PEOPLE ARE RANKING IMMIGRATION IS MORE OF A PRIORITY.

27:17 WHEN IT COMES TO A TRUST DEFICIT WHEN VOTERS ASK ABOUT

27:20 TRUMP OR BIDEN THEY SEE TRUMP DOING BETTER WHEN IT COMES TO

27:22 IMMIGRATION AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER. JONATHAN:

27:27 THE FIRST COUPLE LINES OF THAT COMING UP IN CONVERSATIONS DOWN

27:28 IN WASHINGTON D C. THE NUMBER 5000.

27:31 THIS BILL ONLY GIVES SHUTDOWN AUTHORITY AFTER 5000 ENCOUNTERS

27:35 A DAY. CAN YOU BUILD THAT OUT A LITTLE

27:38 BIT. ANNMARIE:

27:44 SENATOR KYRSTEN SINEMA IS VERY FRUSTRATED, SHE'S AN

27:45 INDEPENDENT WHO WORKED ON THE BILL. SHE SAID THE BORDER

27:50 AUTOMATICALLY CLOSES WHEN MIGRANT ENCOUNTERS REACH 5000,

27:52 IT DOES NOT MEAN 5000 MIGRANTS ARE PERMITTED TO ENTER EVERY

27:56 DAY. IT'S NOT LEGALIZING THAT IT'S

27:59 MAKING IT AN AUTOMATIC MARK.

28:01 THE CONSENSUS IN WASHINGTON IS NO, I WOULD SAY THERE IS A

28:07 CHANCE DOWN THE ROAD THERE IS A YES. JONATHAN:

28:11 LET'S TURN TO WASHING -- TO CHINA.

28:14 THE EQUITY MARKET HAS BEEN ALL OVER THE PLACE.

28:18 THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT WILL -- PRESIDENT XI JINPING EXPECTED

28:20 TO MEET WITH REGULATORS AS SOON AS TODAY WITH $7 TRILLION BEING

28:28 WIPED OUT IN EQUITIES SINCE 2021. THE NEWS LIFTING CHINA'S

28:31 BENCHMARKING INDEX TO THIS BEST DAY SINCE 2022.

28:35 FOREIGN INFLOWS SURGING TODAY, THE MOST THIS YEAR.

28:37 WE'VE SEEN PLENTY OF REPORTS SAYING PRESIDENT XI JINPING IS

28:41 ABOUT TO DO SOMETHING. WITH LITTLE DETAIL OF WHAT HE

28:44 WILL DO. LISA: XI JINPING IS GETTING ADVICE

28:48 FROM ADVISORS.

28:54 WE'VE HEARD THIS MANY TIMES BEFORE, THEY CAN BUY STOCK OUT

28:55 -- STOCKS OUTRIGHT. ULTIMATELY THEY ARE JUST

29:00 BASICALLY PUTTING BAND-AIDS UNLESS THEY COME UP WITH A

29:04 COHESIVE PLAN FOR HOW THEY WILL COUNTER THE LACK OF ENTHUSIASM

29:07 ON SPENDING, THE LACK OF ENTHUSIASM AND CREDIT DEMAND

29:11 AND FRANKLY JUST POLICY OF CONSISTENCY.

29:17 ANNMARIE: WHOSE BRIEFING WHO? IS XI JINPING BRIEFING

29:22 REGULATORS OR ARE THEY BRIEFING HIM? JONATHAN:

29:24 I THINK HE DOES THE BRIEFING. THIS IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO.

29:30 DO YOUR POINT ON THE NEW YEAR I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT.

29:34 THEY DO NOT WANT CITIZENS GOING HOME BEING WITH FAMILIES

29:36 TALKING ABOUT HOW BAD THIS EQUITY MARKET IS.

29:39 THEY WANT TO FIX IT BEFORE THE WEEKEND. LISA:

29:42 WHAT DOES HE INSTRUCT THEM? HAUL THEM INTO COURT IF THEY

29:46 SEARCH OR SELL THINGS? JONATHAN: IS THAT NOT CALLED THE NATIONAL

29:50 TEAM? LISA: IT'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING GOOD.

29:56 THE KEY IS IT JUST IS NOT STOCK. YOU CONTINUE SEE THE LOSSES.

30:02 HOW MUCH DO PEOPLE KEEP BUYING THE STORY IF IT DOES NOT HAVE

30:04 LASTING POWER? JONATHAN: A BIT OF CLARITY ON WHAT

30:08 HAPPENED LAST WEEK. GROWING PRESSURE FROM A TOP U.S.

30:11 REGULATOR. FOR THE NEW YORK COMMUNITY BANK

30:16 TO SLASH ITS DIVIDEND AND HOARD CASH.

30:19 THIS SENIOR EXECUTIVES HELD BEHIND-THE-SCENES CONVERSATIONS

30:23 WITH THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY

30:25 AHEAD OF LAST WEEK'S DRASTIC'S MOVE.

30:29 THE DECISION TO BUILD RESERVES WAS PART OF AN EXPECTED

30:34 TRANSITION TO TOUGHER REQUIREMENTS AFTER TAKING ON

30:35 ASSETS FROM SIGNATURE BANK JUST LAST YEAR. LISA:

30:40 THEY CROSSED THE THRESHOLD WHICH MADE THEM SUSCEPTIBLE.

30:42 JAY POWELL TALKED ABOUT HOW THEIR WORKING ON A NUMBER OF

30:45 THINGS. I WONDER WHAT OTHER CONVERSATIONS ARE BEING HAD

30:48 BEHIND-THE-SCENES. PEOPLE POINT TO THESE BECAUSE

30:54 THEY'RE INCHING UP TOWARDS THAT $100 BILLION THRESHOLD.

30:56 HOW MANY ARE THERE? THAT'S A KEY QUESTION OF THE

31:00 TIME PEOPLE WERE SPEAKING ABOUT THIS. JONATHAN:

31:05 THE ULTIMATE CRITICISM WASN'T ABOUT THE REGULATION IT WAS

31:08 ABOUT OVERSIGHT, THE ENFORCEMENT OF PHYSICS THING --

31:12 OF EXISTING. IS THIS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE

31:14 EXPERIENCED A YEAR AGO?

31:20 LISA: YOU HAVE TO WONDER GIVEN THE

31:21 NOD TO THIS HOW MUCH MORE IS GOING ON.

31:25 IS IT SUFFICIENT TO REMOVE WHAT'S CONCERNED ABOUT A CREDIT

31:29 CONSTRAINT IN THE MARKET. JONATHAN: LET'S TURN TO EUROPE.

31:34 UBS SHARES FALLING AFTER MISSING THIRD QUARTER ESTIMATES.

31:40 AND RESUME SHARE BUYBACKS IT WITH WHAT THE CEO IS CALLING A

31:41 PIVOTAL YEAR.

31:47 >> I THINK ONE THING IS TO BE WILLING AND THE NEXT COUPLE OF

31:50 YEARS TO SACRIFICE A LEADING BIT OF TOPLINE GROWTH IN ORDER

31:57 TO IMPROVE OUR FINANCIAL RESOURCES. JONATHAN:

32:04 JOINING US TO DISCUSS, LET'S GET STRAIGHT INTO IT.

32:07 WHAT ARE THE GOALS FOR 2024 AND BEYOND?

32:12 >> I GUESS THE BIGGEST GOAL THAT STOOD OUT TO ME IS THEY

32:19 ARE AIMING FOR AN 18% RETURN ON EQUITY WHICH IS VERY BOLD FOR A

32:22 EUROPEAN BANK EVEN FOR UBS.

32:24 INVESTING EFFORTS IN THE VERY IMPORTANT CORE UNIT OF WEALTH

32:28 MANAGEMENT. THESE ARE TWO GOALS THAT ARE

32:30 VERY AMBITIOUS. I WOULD SAY THEY ARE NOT OUT OF

32:33 THE ORDINARY. THEY GIVE US A CLEAR PATH OF

32:39 WHAT THEY WILL BE THINKING AT THIS MOMENT AND HOW THEY WANT

32:40 TO GO WITH THIS NEW ENTITY. THE OTHER BIG GOAL WAS ON COST

32:44 SAVING THE BUMP THIS UP AGAIN. SHOWING US AS WELL THEY ARE ON

32:51 TRACK WITH THE MERGER AND TRYING TO LIFT THOSE SYNERGIES

32:53 AT THE CORE OF THE WHOLE IDEA TO DO IT AND TO MAKE THAT WHOLE

32:56 MERGER WORK. I WOULD SAY THESE RESULTS ARE

32:59 PRETTY GOOD. THERE ARE PROBABLY A FEW THINGS

33:03 THAT ARE WORRIED ABOUT. TODAY WAS VERY REASSURING

33:06 RESULT. JONATHAN:

33:15 THERE WAS SOME CONCERN SOME MONSTERS WERE HIDING ON THE

33:16 BALANCE SHEET AT CREDIT SUISSE. JP: WE DON'T KNOW YET.

33:23 UBS TELLS US THEY ARE VERY SURE EVERYTHING THEY'VE OUTSOURCED

33:27 SPEAKING TO THE NON-CORE LEGACY UNIT THAT THEY ARE NOT

33:31 EXPECTING BIG CREDIT. TODAY'S RESULTS THERE WAS NOT

33:34 MUCH TO BE WORRIED ABOUT. COULD THERE BE SOME TRAPDOORS

33:36 DOWN THE ROAD? THAT'S ALWAYS POSSIBLE.

33:41 IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT WAS SAID DURING THE CALL THEY HAVE 6000

33:45 DIFFERENT BOXES TO MAKE THE MERGER WORK.

33:49 I'M PRETTY SURE ONE OF THOSE IS CREDIT QUALITY AND ASSET

33:50 QUALITY. THEY STILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH A

33:55 LOT OF STUFF AND CONSIDERATION OF WHAT THE MARKET IS GOING TO

33:56 DO. OVERALL AND PRETTY SURE IF THERE'S ANYTHING MAJOR BUT

34:02 WOULD BE A CONCERN TO THE MARKET THEY WOULD'VE TOLD US BY

34:03 NOW. LISA:

34:10 THE MUNDANE CONCERNS OF HOW MANY WEALTH MANAGEMENT CLIENTS

34:13 WANT TO DIVERSIFY BETWEEN TWO FIRMS AND MIGHT MOVE AWAY FROM

34:15 UBS WHO PREVIOUSLY WERE WITH CREDIT SUISSE BECAUSE THEY WANT

34:17 THE DIVERSIFICATION. DO WE HAVE ANY SENSE OF WHAT'S

34:20 GOING ON WITH THAT? JP: THAT IS A BIG ISSUE.

34:26 IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS YOU CAN TAKE THE TARGET OF 5

34:30 TRILLION INVESTED ASSETS AND IF YOU GO TO CREDIT YOU CAN

34:35 CALCULATE THE GROWTH RATE THEY ARE ASSUMING FOR THIS IS

34:38 BASICALLY INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS FROM THOSE INVESTED

34:39 ASSETS. REALLY CALCULATING A LOT OF

34:44 ORGANIC GROWTH SO TO SPEAK.

34:50 THE BANK SAID WE STILL HAVE TO CONSIDER WE HAVE PEOPLE LEAVING

34:54 THE BANK BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO BANK WITH UBS ALONE OR

34:59 FOR ADVISORY REASONS OR WE DON'T WANT TO IS A CLIENT

35:02 ANYMORE BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN VOCAL ABOUT OPTIMIZING THE

35:06 BUSINESS AND NOT TAKING EVERY CLIENT ON BOARD.

35:12 LOOK AT THE HOLISTIC LINE RELATIONSHIP AND WANT TO HAVE A

35:16 FULL IDEA OF NOT JUST A LOAN FOR EXAMPLE OR JUST DOING

35:19 BROKERAGE FOR THE CLIENT. THERE IS STILL THE POTENTIAL

35:23 THEY ARE LOSING SOME OF THOSE OUTFLOWS.

35:29 SOME PEOPLE CAN ARGUE MAY THOSE TARGETS ARE A LITTLE BIT VAGUE

35:32 SO TO SPEAK AND IS NOT CLEAR THE PATH TO THE TARGET.

35:36 I GUESS UBS IS DOING THE BEST THEY CANNOT THIS POINT.

35:40 THERE'S A LOT OF MOVING PARTS BUT TO ME VERY IMPORTANT THAT

35:45 WAS ACTUALLY THE FAILURE, UBS IS VERY GOOD AT THIS POINT IN

35:47 WHAT IS SAID CONNECTING THE DOTS.

35:50 THEY ARE GIVING US THE DOTS TELLING US THE STORY HOW WE

35:55 WANT TO ACHIEVE WHAT THEY'RE PUTTING OUT HIS TARGETS.

35:57 THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO INVESTORS OUT THERE AT LEAST

36:01 LONG-TERM INVESTORS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW

36:04 MANAGEMENT THINKS, WHAT IS AT THE CORE AND WHAT IS NOT.

36:07 I THINK THEY ARE DOING A GOOD JOB AT THIS. LISA:

36:11 ZOOMING OUT THERE IS THE QUESTION WHETHER UBS IS THE

36:16 MODEL FOR WHAT'S TO COME FOR MAJOR EUROPEAN BANKS OR IS IT

36:21 JUST BENEFITING FROM THE BOOM WE ARE SEEING WITH OTHERS THAT

36:27 ARE ACTUALLY DELIVERING RESULTS IMPRESSING SOME INVESTORS.

36:32 JONATHAN: GAETZ -- JP: IT'S HARD TO USE THAT AS A

36:36 BLUEPRINT. THEY'VE BEEN VERY SIMILAR IN

36:41 TERMS OF THE BUSINESS AND FOCUS WITH THE WEALTH MANAGEMENT AT

36:43 THE CORE SO THAT MAKES STUFF EASIER.

36:47 THEY DON'T HAVE A BIG IMPACT TO CROSS-BORDER MERGER.

36:51 THAT MAKES IT VERY HARD TO SAY THIS IS GOING TO WORK FOR ALL

36:55 THE BANKS. IT IS REASSURING FOR THE SECTOR

36:58 AS A WHOLE THAT YOU CAN MAKE A BIG MERGER WORK BUT THERE STILL

37:02 A PROBLEM OF BIG FRAGMENTATION IN EUROPE, DIFFERENT STANDARDS

37:05 WHEN IT COMES TO CAPITAL AND HOW YOU CAN MOVE CAPITAL

37:08 BETWEEN EQUITIES AND ENTITIES ACROSS BORDERS.

37:11 THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE SOLVED BEFORE YOU CAN TALK

37:14 CROSS-BORDER MERGERS.

37:20 THAT IS STILL VERY FAR DOWN THE ROAD. JONATHAN:

37:23 DON'T GET PEOPLE EXCITED JP. THIS IS THE LATEST THIS MORNING

37:27 FROM THE WALL STREET JOURNAL. HERE IT IS, JP MORGAN PLANNING

37:35 TO BUILD 500 MORE BRANCHES IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS.

37:37 EXECUTIVES ACCORDING TO THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ARE

37:41 TARGETING 20% SHARE OF U.S. DEPOSITS. A 20% SHARE OF U.S.

37:46 DEPOSITS. LISA: IN FAIRNESS, WHERE ELSE DO THEY

37:51 HAVE TO GO? IF THEY WANT TO GROW THEY JUST

37:55 HAVE TO DOMINATE THAT MUCH MORE. IT'S JP MORGAN'S GAME EVERYONE

37:59 ELSE IS JUST PLAYING IT. JONATHAN:

38:02 THE SHARE OF DEPOSIT FOR 13% WHICH IS ALREADY PRETTY

38:07 STAGGERING NUMBER. AND ONLY GOING HIGHER.

38:11 BUT SCHEDULE AN UPDATE THIS MORNING.

38:18 DANI: THE U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE IS ON HIS

38:23 FIFTH VISIT TO THE MIDDLE EAST SINCE HAMAS'S ATTACK ON ISRAEL.

38:28 NEGOTIATORS IN EGYPT AND QATAR ARE PROPOSING A DEAL WITH HAMAS

38:31 TO PAUSE FIGHTING AND ALLOW FOR THE RELEASE OF THE MEANING

38:33 ISRAELI HOSTAGES. ISRAEL INTERN WILL RELEASE

38:37 PALESTINIAN PRISONERS. THEY ARE TO MAKE STOPS IN THE

38:40 WEST BANK. NIKKI HALEY HAS REQUESTED

38:46 SECRET SERVICE PROTECTION AFTER RECEIVING THREATS AGAINST HER.

38:49 SHE CONFIRMED THE THREATS AND INTERVIEW WITH NBC BUT DID NOT

38:51 DISCLOSE FURTHER DETAIL. HALEY'S QUALIFICATION WILL BE

38:57 DETERMINED BY THE SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY AFTER

38:59 CONSULTATION WITH THE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE.

39:02 KING CHARLES IS RECEIVING TREATMENT FOR AN UNSPECIFIED

39:06 FORM OF CANCER. BUCKINGHAM PALACE IS RULED OUT

39:11 PROSTATE CANCER BUT IS NOT SPECIFYING FURTHER DETAIL.

39:14 THE PALACE ADDS KING CHARLES WILL CONTINUE STATE BUSINESS

39:16 AND OFFICIAL PAPERWORK, REMAINING POSITIVE ABOUT HIS

39:19 TREATMENT AND LOOKS FORWARD TO RETURNING TO FULL PUBLIC DUTY

39:21 AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. JONATHAN: APPRECIATE THE UPDATE.

39:27 THE DATA-DEPENDENT FED.

39:31 >> IF WE JUST KEEP GETTING MORE DATA LIKE WE HAVE GOTTEN WE ARE

39:35 WELL BEYOND THE PATH TO NORMALIZATION.

39:38 >> THAT'S COMING UP NEXT LIFE FROM NEW YORK CITY, THIS IS

39:45 BLOOMBERG.

39:46 ♪

40:05 JONATHAN: LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY,

40:08 EQUITIES LOOK LIKE THIS ON THE S&P 500.

40:13 EQUITY FUTURES NEGATIVE BY 0.1%. YIELDS GOING ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE.

40:18 SOME STABILITY AFTER THE CHAOS. THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS. LISA:

40:21 WHY OLD. JONATHAN: DOUBLE-DIGIT -- WILD.

40:28 JONATHAN: PAYROLLS BLOWOUT REPORT FRIDAY

40:29 TO END OF THE WEEK. PRETTY TREMENDOUS.

40:35 LISA: THERE WAS A VERY CLEAR SHIFT IN

40:41 MOOD.

40:42 IT WASN'T THIS UNCERTAIN WHAT'S GOING ON, THIS WAS ALL OF A

40:44 SUDDEN TRYING TO REASSESS THE PATH OF INFLATION COMING DOWN

40:48 SLOWLY AND IF THE FED CANNOT CUT RATES QUITE AS MUCH IS

40:51 POSSIBLE IT'S A RESET. PEOPLE ARE SAYING HOW MUCH

40:53 FURTHER DOES THIS HAVE TO GO. JONATHAN:

40:59 34 BILLION DOLLARS OF THREE-YEAR NOTES.

41:00 42 BILLION OF 10-YEAR NOTE'S TOMORROW.

41:04 LATER IN THE WEEK WE WILL GET $25 BILLION OF 30 YEAR BONDS.

41:06 LISA: I THINK IT'S A -- IT IS IMPORTANT.

41:15 BASICALLY WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SUPPLY ISSUES AND THE -- THEY

41:20 DON'T CARE WHEN WE GO BACK TO SOMETHING FAMILIAR INTO THIS

41:26 LOW-INFLATION NARRATIVE.

41:27 IT'S A REAL GOOD NARRATIVE TEST, NOT NECESSARILY SHARING

41:31 THE AGENDA FOR DEFICITS, IT SETS THE TONE. JONATHAN:

41:43 YOU GET THE LIST, IT IS BRAMO'S FAVORITE ON THE TERMINAL.

41:48 >> IT FEELS LIKE THE ECONOMY HAS BEEN QUITE STRONG ON THE

41:51 GROWTH FRONT YOU HAVE BIG JOBS NUMBERS, GDP NUMBERS BETTER

41:54 THAN EXPECTED. BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE THAT

41:57 INFLATION BETTER THAN EXPECTED. IF WE JUST KEEP GETTING MORE

42:04 DATA LIKE WE'VE GOTTEN, WE ARE WELL BEYOND THE PATH TO

42:06 NORMALIZATION. JONATHAN: THE CHICAGO FED PRESIDENT

42:12 SITTING DOWN WITH MICHAEL MCKEE ECHOING COMMENTS FROM CHAIRMAN

42:13 POWELL. LOOKING FOR MORE DATA.

42:20 ALL SET TO SPEAK LATER ON TODAY. LISA:

42:27 THERE IS A SUBTLE SHIFT, AUSTIN TENDS TO GO ON MORE THE SUPPLY

42:30 SIDE. SAYING IT'S POSSIBLE DURING THE

42:39 POST-PANDEMIC RECOVERY PERIOD, BASICALLY WE ARE LOOKING AT

42:43 SOMETHING THAT SUBSTANTIALLY ABOVE NEUTRAL. JONATHAN:

42:47 WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE EMERGING MARKETS.

42:53 AS IF IT'S NOT A STRUGGLE ALREADY FOR EMERGING MARKETS.

42:56 GETTING TREMENDOUS DATA IN AMERICA.

43:00 >> WE HAVE TO KEEP TALKING ABOUT CHINA, IT IS

43:02 UN-INVESTABLE. PRESIDENT XI JINPING VISITED

43:07 THE PBOC. IN CHINESE EQUITIES.

43:18 ALIBABA HAS LOST 75% OF THEIR MARKET VALUE SINCE 2020.

43:20 JONATHAN: THAT'S AMAZING.

43:24 >> PROBABLY THE CHEAPEST STOCK YOU WILL FIND IN CHINESE -- NOT

43:29 INVESTABLE CERTAINLY BUT TRADABLE POTENTIALLY. LISA:

43:32 WHICH MIGHT LEAVE PEOPLE SCRATCHING THEIR HEADS, ARE YOU

43:37 SAYING IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT XI JINPING DOES WITH RESPECT TO

43:43 TRULY PROVIDING THIS MARKET, JUST THE MEETING IS A TRADABLE

43:48 EVENT. DAMIAN: WHAT YOU'RE ASKING IS WHAT THE

43:52 CROSS PROTECTION CLAUSES BEING TRIGGERED BY FINANCE VEHICLES.

43:54 LISA: 100%. DAMIAN: WHICH IS A PRETTY BIG DEAL.

44:01 THEY HAVE NEVER DEFAULTED ON THEIR PUBLIC DEBT -- YOU'RE

44:07 ASKING ABOUT THE COLLATERAL THEY HAVE TO ADDITIONALLY

44:10 PROVIDE BONDHOLDERS TO KEEP THEM COMFORTABLE TO FUND

44:13 EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON LOCALLY.

44:15 I THINK SERIOUSLY WHAT I'M LOOKING AT THIS WEEK IN

44:20 ADDITION TO CHINA INFLATION DATA IS THE EXPORT DATA IN

44:22 LATIN AMERICA. JUERGEN IS SEE IT FIRST IN THE

44:26 EXPORTERS. I'LL BE WATCHING EXPORTS OUT OF

44:32 BRAZIL JUST TO HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT THIS IS LIKE.

44:36 WE WON'T GET A SENSE OF THE CHINESE DOMESTIC MARKET UNTIL

44:37 MID-MARCH.

44:43 WE MIGHT GET SOME ECONOMIC DATA BUT WE ARE NOT TO HAVE ANY

44:45 COLOR AS TO WHAT MARK -- EMERGING MARKETS WILL DO.

44:49 ANNMARIE: WE WERE ASKING WHO WAS BRIEFING

44:52 WHO. HOW IMPORTANT IS NEW -- LUNAR

44:55 NEW YEAR WEIGHING ON OFFICIALS? DAMIAN:

44:59 THEY NEED TO GET SENTIMENT FIXED THROUGH THE NEXT WEEK OR

45:03 TWO IN ORDER FOR PEOPLE TO SPEND AND RETAIL SALES TO PICK

45:08 UP. I THINK IT IS CRITICAL THE MESSAGING RIGHT NOW.

45:12 WHAT IS PRESENT XI JINPING DISCUSSING.

45:15 WILL IT BE MORE REGULATIONS ON THE SHORT SIDE BRAIDED WILL OR

45:18 BE REAL STIMULUS IN THE RIGHT PLACES.

45:21 THEY HAVEN'T BEEN SUCCESSFUL YET. IT'S SORT OF A PRECURSOR IT

45:25 TOOK THEM A LONG TIME TO RIGHT THE SHIP AND EVEN WHEN EQUITIES

45:31 DID PEAK IN 2020 IT WAS FAR FROM THE PEAK OF 2015.

45:37 I'M TERRIBLY NOT OPTIMISTIC BUT -- JONATHAN:

45:40 CAN YOU TELL US WHY THEY'VE BEEN RELUCTANT TO DO THAT.

45:45 VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH THROUGH THE PANDEMIC, WHY HAVE THEY

45:46 BEEN SO RELUCTANT? DAMIAN: THE GREATEST 15 YEAR BUILD IN

45:51 LEVERAGE AND DEBT IN WORLD HISTORY PRECEDED WHAT WE'VE

45:56 JUST WITNESSED. PRISON XI JINPING IS TRYING TO

46:00 DO THE RIGHT THING BUT IT'S BECOME SO VERY BIG.

46:03 YOU CAN JUST THINK YOU WILL PUT ON THE BRAKES AND THINGS ARE

46:05 KNOCKING A BREAK. IT'S THE SAME THING WITH THE

46:07 PANDEMIC. WE NEVER REALLY SAW THAT.

46:14 IF YOU LOOK AT ENERGY DEMAND, OIL DEMAND.

46:18 CHINA IS GOING TO BE A THIRD OF NEW OIL DEMAND THIS YEAR.

46:23 THEY ARE REDOING THEIR REFINING INDUSTRY, MARGINS ARE IMPROVING.

46:30 THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS TO BE BOLD ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN

46:32 CHINA AND HOW IT SPILLS OUT. AS IT RELATES TO CHINA.

46:37 JONATHAN: IF THIS WAS THE BEAR'S DREAM,

46:43 THE BALANCE SHEET RECESSION CALL MADE YEARS AND YEARS AGO

46:47 ON CHINA DO YOU SEE ELEMENTS OF THAT MATERIALIZING? DAMIAN:

46:51 IT NEVER DID MATERIALIZE TO THE EXTENT WE THOUGHT IT WOULD NOW

46:58 LOOK, THE VIGILANTES ARE NOW BACK SO PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT

47:03 THE FISCAL DEFICIT AND RESERVES TO GDP IN THE U.S..

47:05 THERE WILL BE A HEIGHTENED

47:08 FOCUS ON VALUE AS OPPOSED TO CARRIE, AWAITS COMPRESSED

47:12 GLOBALLY. IT MEANS IS NOT TO BE AS MUCH

47:17 MONEY, PEOPLE WILL LOOK FOR VALUE AND THAT'S WHERE THE

47:18 FUNDAMENTALS KICK IN. LISA: I THINK ABOUT HOW THEY DEAL

47:23 WITH THE CHINA QUESTION. AND THERE'S DATA COMING OUT

47:29 TOMORROW THAT'S EXPECTED TO SHOW THE U.S.

47:31 TRADE DEFICIT WITH CHINA HIT ITS LOWEST LEVEL IN AT LEAST 13

47:36 YEARS LED BY A DROP IN IMPORTS. IF YOU LOOK AS A SHARE OF GDP

47:41 THOSE ARE LEVELS LAST SEEN SINCE THE EARLY 2000'S.

47:43 HOW MUCH OF THIS IS A TASTE OF WHAT'S TO COME. DAMIAN:

47:46 IS THAT INDICATIVE OF DEMAND FROM THE U.S.

47:51 OR IS THAT SUPPLY OUT OF CHINA OR MAYBE LOGISTICS. LISA:

47:54 YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO ANSWER THE QUESTION. DAMIAN:

47:57 I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER. JONATHAN:

48:01 AS YOU KNOW WE LOOK AT PLACES LIKE MEXICO, VIETNAM, OF THOSE

48:06 CHINESE EXPORTS ARE MAKING ONE STOP THERE, CAN YOU REALLY GET

48:09 A CLEAN READ ON THE RELATIONSHIP BASED ON THAT?

48:14 DAMIAN: WAS THE MOST ILLIQUID WAY TO

48:15 PAY CHINA? .

48:22 IF YOU LOOK AT ON A CARRIE AND VALUE BASIS, IT'S ONE OF THE

48:24 LOWEST YIELDS AMONG MARKET ROYALTIES.

48:29 I THINK IT'S RALLIED A BIT. IF YOU LOOK AT IT ON A VALUE

48:34 BASIS, IT'S PRETTY EXPENSIVE STILL.

48:37 THOSE ARE TWO STRIKES AGAINST

48:39 THE CHINA YUAN AS AN INVESTMENT CASE, CURRENCY SPECULATOR OR

48:44 RISK MANAGER. FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE IT WILL

48:47 BE A TOUGH SLOG FOR CHINA INVESTORS.

48:50 JONATHAN: ASKING HIS OWN QUESTIONS AND

48:53 ANSWERING THEM. COMING UP IN THE NEXT HOUR ON

50:37 WALL STREET. LISA:

50:43 SHE SAID IF SHE WAS WITH THE NONFARM PAYROLLS REPORT THAT

50:47 ARE HAIRY AND RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE VALIDITY, BUT YOU

50:49 HAVE BEEN WRONG IF YOU DISCOUNTED NUMBERS THAT LOOKED

50:52 TOO STRONG BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT.

50:54 THAT HAS BEEN A CONSISTENT THEME OVER THE PAST 12 TO 18

50:56 MONTHS. FRANKLY, IT IS BEING CONFIRMED

51:00 THROUGH THE ISM SERVICES DATA. JONATHAN:

51:02 THE HEADLINE NUMBER JUMPED IN JANUARY DELIVERING THE BIGGEST

51:05 GAIN IN A YEAR. A PROXY FOR A FUTURE DEMAND

51:09 ROSE TO A THREE-MONTH HIGH. WE HAD MANUFACTURING LAST WEEK

51:14 INCHING CLOSER TO EXPANSION. THAT HAS BEEN IN A SLUMP OR

51:17 SOMETHING LIKE TWO YEARS. PRICES PAID FOR MATERIALS

51:20 JUMPED THE MOST SINCE 2012. HIGHER SHIPPING COSTS,

51:24 INCREASING COMMODITIES PRICES. ACROSS THE BOARD EVERYTHING IS

51:26 PICKING UP AGAIN. LISA: WHERE IS THE SLOW DOWN

51:30 HAPPENING? IT ISN'T HAPPENING IN MANUFACTURING.

51:33 WE ARE SEEING THINGS TURN UP A LITTLE BIT. DO WE GET A LANDING?

51:40 IT RAISES THE QUESTION, WITH OUR GOLDILOCKS IS GOLDILOCKS

51:45 HAVING ISSUES?

51:46 JONATHAN: THE LANDING STORY, IS IT TOO

51:47 EARLY? YOU SAID GOLDILOCKS IS ON LIFE

51:49 SUPPORT. LISA: IT MEANS THEY WILL PROBABLY

51:56 HAVE TO HOLD RATES, IF IT'S TRUE, FOR HIRE FOR LONGER AND

51:58 THEY WILL HAVE TO HOLD BACK. SUDDENLY WE START TALKING ABOUT

52:02 THE POTENTIAL FOR IT TO MAKE SENSE FOR THE FED TO NOT CUT

52:04 RATES UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION LATER THIS YEAR. JONATHAN:

52:07 THE ECONOMIC DATA COMES INTO START THE YEAR LOOKING GREAT.

52:12 A CAPTIVE AUDIENCE ON SUNDAY EVENING MAY BE 120 MILLION

52:15 AMERICANS IN FRONT OF TELEVISION SCREENS.

52:17 YOU GET THE OFFER OF DOING A PRE-SUPER BOWL INTERVIEW AND

52:20 YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THIS GOOD STUFF.

52:23 AND THEN YOU SAY NO AND YOUR COMPS DIRECTOR SAYS, WE DON'T

52:27 KNOW WHO WILL BE PAYING ATTENTION.

52:30 THEY MIGHT BE GETTING THE CHILI READY AND PUTTING THE BEER IN

52:32 THE BOX. THAT IS THE WORDS OF THE BIDEN

52:35 CAMPAIGN. LISA: IT FEELS LIKE THIS

52:40 ADMINISTRATION IS NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE 150 MILLION

52:43 EYEBALLS TO TELL A GOOD STORY OF THE MOMENT, TWO YEARS OF

52:50 UNEMPLOYMENT UNDER 4%. WE SEE THE PRESIDENT TALKING

52:51 ABOUT THE ECONOMY TO SPECIFIC GROUPS.

52:53 HE WAS IN NEVADA AHEAD OF THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY.

52:56 YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE THIS. WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT INFLATION

52:59 COMING DOWN HE TALKED ABOUT THE BEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AND

53:01 MORE WORK TO DO. HE SAID THAT HIGH PRICES WERE

53:05 PARTLY THE WORK OF "A LITTLE BIT OF CORPORATE GREED."

53:08 IT IS AT SOME OF THE ISSUES YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHEN IT

53:13 COMES TO SHIPPING COSTS. THE ADMINISTRATION IS GOING TO

53:16 HAMMER THAT THEY THINK IT IS CORPORATION'S PROBLEM. JONATHAN:

53:19 YOU HAVE TO YOU COMMUNICATE THAT THE ECONOMY IS AS GOOD AS

53:21 YOU THINK IT IS WHEN A LOT OF THE POLLING DOESN'T AGREE WITH

53:22 YOU. AND TWO IS IMMIGRATION. THERE IS A BILL WORKING THROUGH

53:28 CONGRESS AND A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT IT'S DEAD ON ARRIVAL.

53:31 WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRY TO COMMUNICATE THE SUBSTANCE OF

53:33 THE BILL AND WHY YOU THINK THAT IT WILL HELP YOU DO A JOB IN A

53:38 WAY THAT YOU CAN'T RIGHT NOW. AT THE MOMENT IT FEELS LIKE

53:41 REPUBLICANS AND THE CONSERVATIVE MESSAGE HAS

53:42 HIJACKED THE BILL AND SPUN IN A WAY THAT MAKES IT YOU LIKE IS

53:46 NOT GOING TO ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING PROBLEMS AT THE

53:48 SOUTHERN BORDER. ANNMARIE: WHICH IS WHY YOU SEE THE

53:51 ADMINISTRATION HAVING TO COME OUT AND TALK ABOUT LIGHT WILL

53:54 WORK. I THEN SAYS IT WOULD GIVE THEM

53:56 THE AUTHORITY TO SHUT DOWN THE BORDER.

53:58 THERE IS ONE ISSUE AROUND THE 5000 MIGRANTS COMING ACROSS THE

54:01 BORDER THAT MANY CONSERVATIVES ARE SAYING THAT THAT ALMOST

54:04 MAKES IT LEGAL FOR 5000 MIGRANTS TO COME ACROSS THE

54:05 BORDER. KYRSTEN SINEMA HAS HAD A LOT OF

54:08 ISSUES WITH THIS. SHE SAYS IT IS BEING

54:10 MANIPULATED. SHE SAYS IF THERE ARE 5000

54:16 ENCOUNTERS AUTOMATICALLY A BORDER IS SHUT GIVING THE

54:18 PRESIDENT SOME AUTHORITY SIMILAR TO TITLE 42 DURING THE

54:23 PANDEMIC. LISA:

54:24 THE LAST HOUR EXPRESSED A LOT OF FRUSTRATION ABOUT THIS AND I

54:28 WON'T REHASH THAT, BUT DESPITE SOME OF THE INACTION AND

54:30 PARALYSIS WE TALK ABOUT IN WASHINGTON THEY DID PASS A LOT

54:33 OF STIMULUS. YOU START TO WONDER HOW MUCH

54:37 THAT IS UNDERPINNING A LOT OF THIS NARRATIVE THAT WE ARE

54:38 GETTING BACK. TO BRING IT FULL CIRCLE,

54:41 BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE TALK ABOUT WHEN I SPEAK WITH

54:44 THEM, THAT THERE IS SO MUCH MONEY THAT IS BEEN PUMPED INTO

54:45 THE ECONOMY. ANNMARIE: HEART OF THE STRUCTURE.

54:49 THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT. AND THEN CHIPS.

54:55 $166 BILLION ALREADY FOR CHIPS WITH THE CHIPS AND SCIENCE ACT

54:57 AND A LOT OF THAT ISN'T EVEN IN THE FIELD YET.

55:01 SO, THERE IS A LOT OF PENT-UP DEMAND FROM THE MONEY THAT WILL

55:04 POTENTIALLY BE COMING OUT OF WASHINGTON.

55:06 IT ISN'T ALL OUT YET, BUT POTENTIALLY WE WILL SEE SOME OF

55:09 IT. JONATHAN: I CAN SENSE THE FRUSTRATION

55:11 EVEN WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO HOLD IT BACK. LISA:

55:13 I'M TRYING TO BE GOOD. I THOUGHT THAT I WAS REALLY

55:14 DIPLOMATIC. ANNMARIE:

55:21 TRYING TO GET THOSE AND THEN SOMETHING BIPARTISAN WHEN IT

55:23 COMES TO IMMIGRATION, SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN DEBATED IN

55:24 WASHINGTON FOR DECADES.

55:25 JONATHAN: HERE IS THE BROADER PRICE

55:29 ACTION ON THE S&P 500 WITH EQUITY FUTURE SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE

55:34 BY 0.06% IN THE BOND MARKET YIELDS ARE UNCHANGED, 4.15 20.

55:41 FOREIGN-EXCHANGE, THAT CURRENCY NEGATIVE BY 0.7%.

55:46 COMING UP, BNP PARIBAS ON RESETTING MARKET EXPECTATIONS.

55:53 THE FRONT-END OF THE YIELD CURVE.

55:56 AND GEORGE FERGUSON ON BOEING'S LATEST CHALLENGES.

55:58 WE BEGIN WITH OUR TOP STORY, RECESSION CALLS IN REVERSE AS

56:00 THE U.S. ECONOMY DRIVES FORWARD. MARKETS ARE FINALLY WAKING UP

56:08 TO THE INFLATION RISK AFTER IGNORING IT FOR MONTHS.

56:09 IT IS CLEAR THAT THE GOLDILOCKS NARRATIVE OF ACCELERATING

56:14 GROWTH AND DECELERATING INFLATION WAS A FAIRYTALE.

56:18 DAN MORRISON JOINS US FOR MORE. LET'S GET INTO WHY THE

56:23 GOLDILOCKS NARRATIVE WAS A FAIRYTALE. WHAT ARE YOU SEEING?

56:25 WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE ECONOMIC MIX OF THE MOMENT? DANIEL:

56:31 THE GOLDILOCKS TORY MADE SENSE PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC BUT THE

56:34 DISTINCTION THAT WE TRY TO MAKE BETWEEN GOLDILOCKS AND SOUTH

56:37 LANDING IS THAT WE HAVE DECELERATING GROWTH.

56:40 AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE DECELERATING INFLATION.

56:43 THAT'S NOT SUCH A GREAT ENVIRONMENT.

56:44 IT IS OBVIOUSLY BETTER THAN A RECESSION BUT IT IS STILL

56:46 SLOWING GROWTH. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR WE

56:50 HAD THE IDEA THAT YOU COULD HAVE THREE PLUS PERCENT GDP

56:54 GROWTH AT THE SAME TIME THAT YOU HAVE FALLING INFLATION.

56:57 THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN HAVE STABLE OR IMPROVING ECONOMIC

56:59 GROWTH ABOUT INFLATION CONTINUING TO DECELERATE.

57:03 WE THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS NEVER CREDIBLE AND AFTER THE PAYROLL

57:06 DATA ON FRIDAY AND SENSE I THINK THAT IT IS THAT IDEA.

57:08 LISA: THIS IS A COMPELLING IDEA TO ME

57:13 AND I WAS JOKING THAT GOLDILOCKS IS ON LIFE-SUPPORT

57:16 AND YOU POINTED OUT THAT IT WAS FICTIONAL TO BEGIN WITH.

57:19 WHAT HAS TO GIVE? IS IT THE SOFT LANDING OR THE

57:22 INFLATION ASPECT OF THAT IT KEEPS COMING DOWN IN TANDEM

57:25 WITH ONGOING STRENGTH FROM THE ECONOMY? DANIEL:

57:29 IT ULTIMATELY SEEMS THAT GROWTH IS GOING TO HAVE TO SLOW EVEN

57:31 IF THE ECONOMY REALLY REFUSES TO DO SO.

57:35 GIVEN THAT WE BELIEVE THAT INTEREST RATES ARE AT A

57:38 RESTRICTIVE LEVEL, AND WE CAN DEBATE ALL DAY IF YOU WOULD

57:42 LIKE TO, BUT THEY WILL EVENTUALLY SLOW ECONOMIC GROWTH.

57:45 WE APPRECIATE THE REASON THAT THAT HASN'T HAPPENED YET IS

57:48 BECAUSE OF THE FISCAL STIMULUS THAT HAS BEEN PUT INTO THE

57:50 ECONOMY. IT IS THE BATTLE BETWEEN

57:55 MONETARY POLICY ON ONE HAND AND FISCAL POLICY ON THE OTHER.

57:58 BUT RATES HIGH ENOUGH FOR LONG ENOUGH AND U.S.

57:59 GROWTH RATES WILL SLOW. IT ISN'T JUST THAT U.S.

58:03 GROWTH NEEDS TO SLOW, IT NEEDS TO SLOW TO BELOW TREND GROWTH

58:06 RATE MEANING THAT YOU NEED TO BE SOMEWHERE BELOW 1.75% IN

58:10 ORDER TO GET INFLATION BACK TO TARGET.

58:11 WE ARE A LONG WAY FROM THAT. LISA: WALK US THROUGH HOW THIS

58:16 INFORMS YOUR INVESTMENT. YOU ARE NOT EXACTLY BEARISH.

58:21 YOUR NOTES SOUND LIKE YOU'RE STILL CONSTRUCTIVE, BUT MAYBE

58:25 NOT AS CONSTRUCTIVE OR YOU THINK THAT THINGS WILL SLOW

58:26 LATER. HOW DO YOU SEE THIS CHANGING

58:27 YOUR VIEW? DANIEL: I THINK IT IS THE TIMING THAT

58:32 WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT. WE APPRECIATE THAT MONETARY

58:35 POLICY WORKS WITH A LAG AND CLEARLY THE FED WON'T BE

58:37 CUTTING RATES ANYTIME SOON. THE PREVIOUS HIKES AND CURRENT

58:41 LEVELS OF INTEREST RATES WILL CONTINUE TO SLOW THE ECONOMY.

58:44 ARE WE GOING TO SEE A SUDDEN DECELERATION AT SOME POINT

58:47 LATER IN THE YEAR? WE THINK THAT THAT IS

58:50 ULTIMATELY WHAT WILL BE REFLECTED IN MARKET PRICES.

58:55 SO FAR WHAT YOU SEE IN EQUITIES IS A VERY SUSTAINED RELATIVELY

58:56 HIGH LEVEL OF GROWTH. WE DON'T THINK THAT THAT WILL

59:01 LAST. WHEN YOU SEE THAT DECELERATION YOU WILL HAVE TO

59:04 SEE SOME WEAKNESS IN EQUITY PRICES. JONATHAN:

59:09 IF YOU STRIP OUT THE MAJOR TECH PLAYERS, IS THAT REALLY WHAT WE

59:10 SEE IN EQUITIES? DANIEL: I THINK SO.

59:16 IF YOU TRY TO TAKE THE RUSSELL 1000 VALUE INDEX AS A PROXY FOR

59:21 THE NONTEXT PARTS OF THE S&P IT STILL HAD A DECENT YEAR LAST

59:23 YEAR AND YOU'RE STILL LOOKING FOR A PERCENT TO 9% EARNINGS

59:24 GROWTH THIS YEAR. -- 8% TO 9% EARNINGS GROWTH

59:30 THIS YEAR. EVEN THEIR THERE IS JUSTIFIED

59:33 OPTIMISM, IS JUST A QUESTION OF IF THE OPTIMISM AT THIS LEVEL

59:34 IS SUPPORTED.

59:35 JONATHAN: TALKING ABOUT THE REPRICING OF

59:39 INTEREST RATES HIGHER AND THE PARTS OF THE EQUITY MARKET THAT

59:45 MIGHT BE VULNERABLE. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FINANCIALS.

59:50 IS THAT PRESSURE ON THE FINANCIALS ALL OVER AGAIN?

59:52 I WONDER IF THE EVENTS OF LAST WEEK WERE TRULY A ONE-OFF OR IF

59:54 YOU EXPECT TO SEE MORE OF THAT IN THE WEEKS AHEAD? DANIEL:

59:59 IN GENERAL, IF WE LOOK AT THE TRADE-OFF WITH THE RELATIVE

01:00:02 PERFORMANCE OF GROWTH VERSUS VALUE, YOU ARE RIGHT.

01:00:05 ON THE ONE HAND, IF INTEREST RATES GO UP WE KNOW THE

01:00:08 SENSITIVITY EVALUATIONS FOR GROWTH STOCKS.

01:00:11 YOU ARE RIGHT, IT WILL CERTAINLY AFFECT WHAT WE SEE IN

01:00:15 TERMS OF FINANCIALS AND ENERGY, WHICH IS ANOTHER KEY PART OF

01:00:16 THE VALUE INDEX. IT WILL BE THAT DYNAMIC ON ONE

01:00:20 HAND DRIVING ECONOMIC GROWTH, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND DISCOUNT

01:00:22 RATES. THE INTEREST RATES WILL ASSERT

01:00:25 WHETHER OR NOT REAL GROWTH VERSUS DYNAMIC CONTINUES INTO

01:00:30 THIS YEAR. LISA: WHAT IS THE THRESHOLD FOR

01:00:34 BENCHMARK RATES AT WHICH POINT IT REALLY CHALLENGES A HOST OF

01:00:37 VALUATIONS IN THE S&P AND THE RUSSELL 1000 AND 2000? DANIEL:

01:00:43 IF YOU REALLY THOUGHT THAT POLICY RATES NEEDED TO GO

01:00:47 HIGHER, YOU WOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT IF THERE WILL BE A

01:00:50 TIPPING POINT IN TERMS OF EQUITY MARKETS.

01:00:52 FOR US, IT ISN'T THAT RATES NEED TO GO HIGHER, IT IS THAT

01:00:55 YOU WON'T GET 150 BASIS POINTS IN CUTS OUT OF THE FED THIS

01:00:57 YEAR THE WAY THAT THE MARKET THOUGHT AT ONE POINT.

01:01:04 POWELL SEEMED INSISTENT THAT 75 SEEMED LIKE A REASONABLE NUMBER.

01:01:09 IF YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE OUTLOOK LATER IN THE YEAR COME

01:01:10 YOU DON'T WANT TO PAINT TO BEARISH OF THE PICTURE.

01:01:14 LAST YEAR TO THE END OF THIS YEAR SHOULD BE IN POSITIVE

01:01:17 TERRITORY, BUT IT IS NOW TRYING TO CALIBRATE WHAT THAT MOVE

01:01:22 SHOULD BE. JONATHAN:

01:01:23 DANIEL MORRIS AT BNP PARIBAS ASSET MANAGEMENT.

01:01:24 LET'S GO BACK A MONTH OR SO. IT WAS TALKED ABOUT ALREADY

01:01:30 THIS YEAR AND I THINK IT'S WORTH GOING OVER.

01:01:33 LAST YEAR, CONSTRUCTIVE ON RISK. STICKING WITH IT THROUGH THE

01:01:37 BANKING STRESS OF LAST SPRING AND EVEN AS THE FEDERAL RESERVE

01:01:39 CONTINUES TO INCREASE INTEREST RATES.

01:01:44 2024, HE CHANGES COURSE AND HE WRITES, THE BIGGEST RISK IS NOT

01:01:48 FROM A SUDDEN DETERIORATION IN EARNINGS ACTIVITY BUT A

01:01:49 REPRICING OF RATES. I KNOW IT IS NOT EVEN THE LAST

01:01:54 COUPLE OF DAYS, BUT WE HAVE HAD A REPRICING OF INTEREST RATES

01:01:58 HIGHER OFF OF THE BANK OF JANUARY DATA.

01:01:59 HOW MUCH WEIGHT DO YOU PUT ON THE JANUARY ECONOMIC DATA?

01:02:04 WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE SPREAD BETWEEN SERVICES AND

01:02:05 MANUFACTURING. HOW WITH THE SPREAD CLOSE?

01:02:11 WOULD SERVICES COME DOWN TO MANUFACTURING OR MANUFACTURING

01:02:12 COME UP TO SERVICES? THIS IS STARTING TO HAPPEN.

01:02:15 MANUFACTURING IS COMING UP TO SERVICES. LISA:

01:02:20 EVEN BEFORE SOME OF THE FISCAL WHICH WILL FUEL MORE GROWTH IN

01:02:22 CERTAIN AREAS. IT RAISES THE QUESTION OF

01:02:26 WHETHER RATES ARE TRULY RESTRICTIVE -- WE ARE NOT

01:02:29 TALKING ABOUT HIGHER IN TERMS OF POLICY RATES.

01:02:30 THIS IS DIFFERENT. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT RATES

01:02:34 TRULY HIGHER THAN LONGER TAKING JAY POWELL AT HIS WORD TO

01:02:35 CURTAIL SOME OF THE MOMENTUM. TO YOUR POINT OF DO WE TAKE

01:02:41 THIS DATA ON FACE VALUE? THAT IS WHY PEOPLE ARE LOOKING

01:02:45 AT CRP REVISIONS ON FRIDAY. HOW MUCH WILL WE GET A GUT

01:02:49 CHECK GIVEN SOME OF THE ANECDOTAL DATA DOESN'T CONFIRM

01:02:57 WHAT THE HEADLINE NUMBERS SAY?

01:02:58 JONATHAN: IT IS WORTH REPEATING THIS IS

01:02:59 AN OBSERVATION WHERE WE ARE NOT A JUDGMENT OF WHERE WE ARE

01:03:01 GOING. YOU ULTIMATELY GET ANOTHER

01:03:02 MONTH THAT A FEBRUARY DATA LOOKS LIKE JANUARY YOU GET A

01:03:04 SHIFT IN TERMS OF THE PROBABILITY AROUND A RANGE OF

01:03:06 OUTCOMES AND WE MOVE AWAY FROM THE SOFT LANDING AND GO BACK TO

01:03:09 WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT 12 MONTHS AGO. WHAT LANDING?

01:03:12 LISA: NO LANDING WILL LEAD TO A HARD

01:03:15 LANDING, BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT WE HEAR FROM EVERYONE.

01:03:17 THE DECELERATION WILL BE SUDDEN AND YOU WILL HAVE TO TURN UP

01:03:20 THE SCREWS ON THE ECONOMY AS INFLATION COMES DOWN TO KEEP IT

01:03:22 LOWER. WE WILL DO A REPEAT OF LAST

01:03:23 YEAR. JONATHAN: AN INTERESTING START TO 2024.

01:03:33 THE S&P 500 NEGATIVE BY ALMOST 0.1%. DA HERE'SN YOUR BLOOMBERG

01:03:38 BRIEF. ISPOTIFY IS HIGHER IN THE PREMARKET TRADE AFTER FIRST

01:03:44 QUARTER SINCE -- FIRST QUARTER SUBSCRIBER GROWTH BEAT

01:03:49 ESTIMATES. OVERALL, SALES WERE SPOTIFY

01:03:52 REACHED 3.6 BILLION EUROS, JUST SHORT OF ESTIMATES.

01:03:55 SPOTIFY LAID OFF 70% OF ITS STAFF IN DECEMBER AND RAISED

01:03:58 MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION PRICES BY ONE DOLLAR AND THE U.S.

01:04:00 SHARES OF UBS ARE FALLING THIS MORNING AFTER THE BANK'S FOURTH

01:04:04 QUARTER EARNINGS MISSED ESTIMATES.

01:04:07 A BUYBACK UP TO $1 BILLION IN SHARES THIS YEAR AND AN

01:04:13 INCREASE IN THE COST SAVINGS TARGET. 2024 IS A PIVOTAL YEAR.

01:04:16 >> I THINK THAT ONE THING THAT WE NEED TO DO IS BE WILLING AND

01:04:22 THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS TO SACRIFICE A LITTLE BIT OF

01:04:25 TOPLINE GROWTH IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE RETURNS OF OUR

01:04:31 FINANCIAL RESOURCES ON THE BALANCE SHEET.

01:04:36 >> RED BULL IS INVESTIGATING CHRISTIAN HORNER COME THE CEO

01:04:41 OF ITS FORMULA ONE TEAM, OVER ACCUSATIONS OF INAPPROPRIATE

01:04:42 BEHAVIOR. HE HAS DENIED THE ACCUSATIONS.

01:04:47 I SPOKE WITH THE TEAM PRINCIPAL AT WILLIAMS RACING WHO SAID

01:04:49 THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN ACCEPTING CULTURE.

01:04:53 >> THESE ALLEGATIONS ARE ALLEGATIONS.

01:04:56 I AM AFRAID I DON'T HAVE ANY UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S BEHIND

01:05:00 THEM AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED.

01:05:02 ALL I CAN SAY IS SHOULD THIS HAPPEN OUR GUARD WILL BE

01:05:06 ENTIRELY SUPPORTIVE IN TERMS OF FIXING IT AND MAKING SURE THAT

01:05:09 WE HAVE A CULTURE THAT IS ACCEPTING OF EVERYONE. DANI:

01:05:11 THAT IS YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF. JONATHAN: APPRECIATE THE UPDATE.

01:05:17 NEXT, PURSUING THE FED'S OBJECTIVE.

01:05:23 >> WE PURSUE 2% OVER TIME. THE PLANS FOR LABOR OR MORE

01:05:25 ALIGNED. WAGE GROWTH ACROSS THE BAY

01:05:28 SPECTRUM IS SETTLING BACK INTO MORE NORMAL PATTERNS. JONATHAN:

01:05:32 THAT IS COMING UP NEXT ON THE PROGRAM. THIS IS BLOOMBERG TV.

01:05:38 ♪

01:05:55 JONATHAN: TWO HOURS AND ABOUT 13 MINUTES

01:05:58 FROM THE OPENING BELL. GETTING BULLIED AROUND THE DESK.

01:06:01 LISA: OH, COME ON. JONATHAN: YIELDS ARE UNCHANGED.

01:06:08 THE 10 YEAR, 4.1578. THIS MORNING, PURSUING THE

01:06:10 FED'S OBJECTIVE.

01:06:12 >> THE PRICE ABILITY OBJECTIVE IS CLEAR.

01:06:16 WE PURSUE 2% INFLATION OVER TIME.

01:06:20 THE SUPPLY DEMAND FOR LABOR IS MORE ALIGNED AND WAGE GROWTH

01:06:23 ACROSS THE PAY SPECTRUM IS SETTLING BACK INTO MORE NORMAL

01:06:24 PATTERNS. IT IS DANGEROUS TO PROCLAIM

01:06:29 WITH CERTAINTY THAT ANY PANDEMIC ERA PHENOMENON WILL

01:06:33 SHAPE FUTURE LABOR MARKETS, BUT THESE ARE POTENTIALLY

01:06:34 SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS THAT COULD BE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT

01:06:37 DRIVERS OF LABOR MARKET DYNAMICS IN THE FUTURE.

01:06:40 JONATHAN: THE ATLANTA FED PRESIDENT

01:06:43 RAPHAEL BOSTIC SAYING THAT THE CENTRAL BANKS INFLATION TARGET

01:06:46 REMAINS AT 2% AND WAGE GROWTH IN LABOR SUPPLY ARE NORMALIZING.

01:06:50 HE OPTED NOT TO TALK ABOUT THE TIMING OR PATH OF INTEREST

01:06:53 RATES IN HIS PREPARED REMARKS AND SPECULATION GROWS AS TO

01:06:54 WHEN WE MIGHT SEE THE FIRST INTEREST RATE CUT.

01:07:00 JULIE CORONADO SUGGESTING THAT THE TIME IS NOW WRITING, THE

01:07:02 QUESTION IS VERY MUCH WHAT ARE WE DOING IT 5.5 PERCENT?

01:07:05 IT'S TIME TO START ADJUSTING THE NOMINAL FUNDS RATE.

01:07:09 JULIA CORONADO JOINS US NOW. LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT.

01:07:13 THE CHAIRMAN OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SAID THAT WE NEED TO

01:07:17 SEE MORE DATA, MORE GOOD DATA, NOT BETTER DATA. JUST MORE DATA.

01:07:25 >> NOT EVEN AS GOOD. JUST GOOD, HE SAID. JONATHAN:

01:07:30 ANY REASON WE WON'T SEE THAT IN THE NEXT THREE MONTHS?

01:07:33 >> NO REAL REASON. YOU WILL NEED THE DATA TO

01:07:39 RATIFY THAT AND DATA CAN ALWAYS SURPRISE US, BUT IF INFLATION

01:07:42 CONTINUES TO BEHAVE AS IT HAS BEEN, THEY ARE RAPIDLY

01:07:46 APPROACHING 2%. I THINK WHAT WE ARE HEARING

01:07:48 FROM THE FED IS THAT THE COMMITTEE IS STRUGGLING TO

01:07:51 CATCH UP TO HOW QUICKLY THE DATA HAVE MOVED.

01:07:54 AND WHAT TO MAKE OF THAT.

01:08:00 IT CERTAINLY DEFIES ALL OF OUR MACRO MODELS FOR INFLATION TO

01:08:02 COME DOWN SO RAPIDLY WITH THE LABOR MARKET SO HEALTHY.

01:08:07 SO, THERE ARE STILL SOME SKEPTICS.

01:08:09 I THINK THAT CHAIR POWELL MIGHT BE HAVING A CHALLENGE

01:08:11 CORRALLING EVERYONE ON THE COMMITTEE.

01:08:14 I THINK THAT HE WANTS TO MAKE THE FIRST MOVE BASED UPON A

01:08:15 STRONG CONSENSUS. I THINK THAT HE IS HAVING A

01:08:20 LITTLE BIT OF COMMITTEE MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES, WHICH IS

01:08:26 WHY HE, IN A VERY DATA UN -DEPENDENT WAY, TOOK MARCH OFF

01:08:35 THE TABLE. JONATHAN:

01:08:37 LISA SAID IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FED MEETING DURING THE NEWS

01:08:39 CONFERENCE TO US AROUND THE TABLE, IT IS LIKE HERDING CATS.

01:08:44 YOU SAID THE SAME THING. WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE STATEMENT

01:08:47 AND NEWS CONFERENCE THAT STOOD OUT TO YOU THAT GAVE YOU THE

01:08:50 IMPRESSION THAT MAYBE THINGS ARE DIVIDED ON THE COMMITTEE AT

01:08:51 THE MOMENT? JULIA: FOR ME, THE MOMENT THAT WAS THE

01:08:56 MOST TELLING WAS WHEN HE TOOK MARCH OFF OF THE TABLE.

01:09:00 HE SAID IT IN A HALTING WAY THAT HE DOESN'T THINK THAT THIS

01:09:04 COMMITTEE WILL HAVE THE CONFIDENCE BY MARCH.

01:09:08 HE THINKS THAT IT IS UNLIKELY, I THINK WAS THE TURN.

01:09:11 IT WAS NOT A REFERENCE TO HIS VIEW BUT TO THE COLLECTIVE

01:09:17 CONFIDENCE, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE JUST

01:09:20 DIGGING IN THEIR HEELS WHO WERE DEEPLY SKEPTICAL OF WHAT

01:09:23 THEY'VE SEEN OR THE LIKELIHOOD OF CONTINUING.

01:09:27 I THINK THAT THAT WAS THE MOMENT WHERE IT WAS LIKE, THAT

01:09:31 IS NOT DATA DEPENDENT AND IT WAS NOT REFERENCING HIS OWN

01:09:36 VIEWS.

01:09:37 WE KNOW THAT CHAIR POWELL HAS BEEN MORE ENCOURAGED AND

01:09:38 OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE DATA FLOW.

01:09:44 MORE WILLING, PERHAPS BECAUSE HE IS NOT AN ECONOMIST, TO

01:09:48 ACCEPT IT FOR WHAT IT IS AND BUY INTO ITS STAYING POWER.

01:09:54 DATA WILL HAVE TO RATIFY IT, BUT SHOULD THEY RATIFY IT THERE

01:09:57 IS NO REASON NOT TO MOVE IN MARCH.

01:10:00 THERE IS TENSION NOW BETWEEN THE FED SAYING THAT THEY ARE

01:10:03 GOING TO START THE CUTTING PROCESS WELL BEFORE WE GET TO

01:10:07 2% AND TAKING MARCH OFF OF THE TABLE, RIGHT?

01:10:11 BECAUSE WE ARE GETTING CLOSE TO 2%. WITH A COUPLE MORE MONTHS WE

01:10:14 COULD BE QUITE CLOSE.

01:10:22 I THINK IT IS JUST THE HERDING CATS CHALLENGE. LISA:

01:10:27 YOU SAID IT'S CLEAR THE FED HAS POLICY IN A RESTRICTIVE PLACE.

01:10:33 TALK ABOUT HERDING CATS, IT IS THE MARKET TOO WITH PEOPLE

01:10:34 QUESTIONING HOW RESTRICTIVE THAT IS.

01:10:38 IF YOU'RE SEEING JOB GROWTH LIKE WE SAW ON FRIDAY, ISM

01:10:43 SERVICES LIKE WE DID LAST MONTH AS WELL. JULIA:

01:10:47 THAT IS A FAIR QUESTION. I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS

01:10:51 THAT HAS BEEN THE HUGE MACRO SURPRISE OF 2023 WAS THE

01:10:52 PRODUCTIVITY BOOM. WE HAD BEEN BULLISH

01:10:58 PRODUCTIVITY, THAT IT WOULD BE STRONG IN 2023 AND WOULD HELP

01:11:02 BRING DOWN INFLATION AND MAKE THE FED TRADE-OFF EASIER THAN

01:11:05 THEY EXPECTED, BUT IT WAS MUCH STRONGER THAN WE EXPECTED.

01:11:08 THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR WAS A PRODUCTIVITY BOOM FOR THE

01:11:11 YEAR. IT IS CLOSE TO 3%.

01:11:18 THAT IS QUITE A PERFORMANCE AFTER A VERY BAD PERFORMANCE IN

01:11:20 2022 WHEN SUPPLY CHAINS WERE DRAGGING US DOWN.

01:11:27 IT IS MASKING, I THINK, SOME OF THE RESTRICTION IN MONETARY

01:11:31 POLICY, WHICH COULD MEAN THAT THE NEUTRAL RATE, AT LEAST FOR

01:11:33 NOW, IS HIGHER. THE BIG UNCERTAINTY -- AND JAY

01:11:40 POWELL TOUCHED ON THIS IN HIS PRESS CONFERENCE -- WE DON'T

01:11:41 KNOW IF WE WILL GET PRODUCTIVITY GAINS LIKE WE SAW

01:11:46 IN 2023 OR ANYWHERE CLOSE. IF WE DO, IF WE ARE NOT JUST IN

01:11:53 A PRODUCTIVITY POST-PANDEMIC DIVIDEND BUT A STRONGER TREND,

01:11:56 THEN THE NEUTRAL RATE COULD BE HIGHER.

01:12:01 ON THE OTHER HAND, IF THIS IS A ONE TIME PRODUCTIVITY DIVIDEND

01:12:05 WE COULD SEE A SUDDEN STOP IN THE ECONOMY AS THAT SLOWS DOWN.

01:12:09 THE RESTRICTION WOULD COME THROUGH AND THEY WOULD HAVE TO

01:12:12 CUT FASTER. I THINK THAT THOSE ARE THE

01:12:13 UNCERTAINTIES WE ARE FACING. LISA:

01:12:18 WE HAVE ABOUT 60 SECONDS LEFT. DO YOU BELIEVE IN GOLDILOCKS OR

01:12:20 DO YOU THINK THAT IT IS INACCURATE AT THIS POINT? JULIA:

01:12:25 I DO BELIEVE IN GOLDILOCKS. I HAVE BEEN BULLISH

01:12:28 PRODUCTIVITY AND I THINK THAT THE TREND IS BETTER.

01:12:30 THAT COULD MEAN A HIGHER NEUTRAL RATE, BUT WHAT IS

01:12:32 HIGHER? IT IS NOT 5.5%. IT MIGHT BE 3%, MAYBE 3.5%.

01:12:40 I DO THINK THAT PRODUCTIVITY IS HIGHER AND THE TRADE-OFFS WILL

01:12:46 CONTINUE TO BE, YOU KNOW, THE FED'S DREAM COME TRUE FOR NOW.

01:12:50 JONATHAN: SOMEWHERE IN THIS COUNTRY THERE

01:12:52 IS A CHILD WAKING UP THAT PUT ON BUSINESS NEWS ON ACCIDENT

01:12:58 INSTEAD OF THE CARTOONS AND HEAR YOU ASKING, DO YOU BELIEVE

01:12:59 IN GOLDILOCKS? THIS CHILD IS NOW FIXATED ON

01:13:04 TWO ADULTS DISCUSSING IF GOLDILOCKS IS ONE REAL OR NOT.

01:13:08 LISA: WELCOME. WE CAN TALK ABOUT FED POLICY

01:13:10 ANOTHER TIME. JONATHAN: AWAY FROM HIS GOLDILOCKS IS

01:13:17 REAL OR NOT, HERDING CATS. LISA: IT SEEMED LIKE THERE WAS SOME

01:13:24 SORT OF GAP, A DISPARITY BETWEEN HIS VIEW AND WHAT HE

01:13:25 HAD TO READ AND STICK TO FOR THE STATEMENT.

01:13:30 HE SEEMED TO HAVE MORE CONVICTION IN THE 60 MINUTES

01:13:32 INTERVIEW WHERE HE LAID OUT EXACTLY WHAT IT IS.

01:13:33 IT'S INTERESTING. I WONDER HOW HEATED THOSE

01:13:35 CONVERSATIONS ARE. JONATHAN: 60 MINUTES IS MORE COMFORTABLE

01:13:42 SPEAKING FROM YOUR OWN OPINIONS. REFLECTING THE CONSENSUS OF THE

01:13:46 COMMITTEE IN THE NEWS CONFERENCE IS TREMENDOUSLY

01:13:48 DIFFICULT TO DO AND I THINK WE SAW THAT LAST WEEK.

01:14:07 JONATHAN: EQUITIES ARE LITTLE SOFTER ON

01:14:11 THE S&P AND THE NASDAQ AND SMALL-CAP AND WRESTLED DOWN

01:14:12 ACROSS THE BOARD.

01:14:18 -.01% ON THE S&P AND NASDAQ 100. IN THE BOND MARKET A BIG

01:14:21 READJUSTMENT THE LAST TWO DAYS. THE TWO-YEAR IS 4.47 AFTER TWO

01:14:25 DAYS OF DOUBLE-DIGIT GAINS ON A TWO YEAR YIELD. LISA:

01:14:30 PEOPLE ARE ALMOST ENTIRELY PRICING OUT THE IDEA OF A MARCH

01:14:31 RATE CUT. ARE THEY GOING TO BACK LOAD

01:14:36 THEM AND WAIT FOR WEAKNESS AND CUT BY 50 BASIS POINTS?

01:14:38 HOW ANY PEOPLE HAVE YOU BEEN TALKING TO WHO SAY IT MEANS

01:14:41 THEY WILL CUT THAT MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVELY LATER IN THE YEAR?

01:14:45 ARE WE HEADING BACK TO KNOW LANDING? THE IDEA THAT THIS IS

01:14:50 SUSTAINABLE, THIS GROWTH AND EXPANSION?

01:14:52 THAT RAISES THE QUESTION OF HOW MUCH THEY CAN CUT AT ALL.

01:14:55 JONATHAN: THEY ARE LOOKING FOR A RESILIENT DOLLAR.

01:15:01 THE EURO IS AGAIN NEGATIVE BY .1%.

01:15:04 THIS HAS BEEN A GRIND LOWER ON THE EURO OVER THE LAST WEEK.

01:15:06 LISA: THEY ARE NOT ALONE. STANDARD CHARTERED SAID THAT

01:15:12 YOU COULD SEE EVEN MORE DOLLAR STRENGTH JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE

01:15:16 THE ECB MOVING AND PERHAPS THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION WITH THE

01:15:18 DATA THAT JUSTIFIES IT. IN THE U.S.

01:15:21 WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SURPRISING RESILIENCE WITH MORE FISCAL

01:15:22 STIMULUS COMING DOWN THE PIKE. JONATHAN:

01:15:26 THE DOLLAR INDEX THE STRONGEST OF THE YEAR SO FAR.

01:15:29 GOING BACK TO THE MIDDLE OF NOVEMBER, THAT IS THE DOLLAR,

01:15:32 THE FX MARKET. YOUR TOP STORIES, THE U.S.

01:15:38 BORDER AND UKRAINE A DEAL NEARING A COLLAPSE WITH

01:15:40 REPUBLICAN SENATORS SAYING ON VOTE TOMORROW ON THE 118

01:15:43 BILLION DOLLAR BILL WOULD BE TOO SOON.

01:15:46 IT WOULD UNLOCK SIGNIFICANT AID FOR UKRAINE AND IMPOSE NEW U.S.

01:15:49 BORDER RESTRICTIONS. DONALD TRUMP LEADING THE PUSH

01:15:53 BACK ON THE BILL, CALLING IT "A DEATH WISH FOR THE REPUBLICAN

01:15:55 PARTY." ANNMARIE: THIS IS SOMETHING THAT FOR SURE

01:16:00 IS ON LIFE SUPPORT. WHAT YOU HEAR FROM REPUBLICAN

01:16:05 SENATORS, ESPECIALLY MANY WHO WANTED TO LINK THESE TWO ITEMS

01:16:10 TOGETHER, WE WON'T GIVE FOR NATE UNTIL WE FIX OUR SOUTHERN

01:16:12 BORDER. MITCH MCCONNELL SAYS THAT THE

01:16:18 PROBLEM IS NOT THE BILL, IT IS THE POLITICS AROUND THAT.

01:16:20 WHEN YOU HAVE THE FORMER PRESIDENT WHO IS NOW YOUR FRONT

01:16:23 RUNNER TO BECOME THE GOP CANDIDATE INTO NOVEMBER AND

01:16:25 POTENTIALLY THE NEXT PRESIDENT IS SAYING THAT THIS IS A DEATH

01:16:28 TO DEMOCRATS -- A GIFT TO DEMOCRATS, I WANT TO RUN ON

01:16:32 THIS ISSUE, DON'T GIVE THIS TO BY THEN. JONATHAN:

01:16:37 THE EDITORIAL BOARD PUT OUT THAT IF REPUBLICANS REJECT THIS

01:16:40 BILL THEY WILL HAND DEMOCRATS AN ARGUMENT.

01:16:42 THE GOP WANTS BORDER CHAOS THAT THEY CAN EXPLOIT AS A CAMPAIGN

01:16:44 ISSUE. AT THE MOMENT IT IS CLEAR IN

01:16:47 THE POLLS THAT THE BLAME IS GOING TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND

01:16:49 NOT TO THE CONSERVATIVES. THE POLL ON THAT ISSUE WILL BE

01:16:55 THE ONE TO WATCH IF THIS BILL DOESN'T PASS. ANNMARIE:

01:16:59 SENATOR LANGFORD SAYS I WON'T HAVE A FUNERAL FOR THIS BILL

01:17:02 YET AND THAT IS WHY I SAY THAT IT'S ON LIFE SUPPORT.

01:17:05 THE ELECTORATE WILL NOT JUST BLAME JOE BIDEN BECAUSE HE IS

01:17:10 AN OFFICE -- IN OFFICE BUT THEY WILL LOOK TO THE REPUBLICANS

01:17:13 AND SAY THAT IT'S A SPLIT GOVERNMENT AND THIS IS A

01:17:14 BIPARTISAN DEAL. WHY ARE YOU NOT SIGNING UP FOR

01:17:15 IT.

01:17:16 LISA: NO ONE WANTS TO HEAR MY RANT

01:17:19 ABOUT POLITICS VERSUS POLICY BUT IT RAISES THE QUESTION ON

01:17:22 TURNOUT. IF YOU SEE THIS GOING ON AGAIN

01:17:25 AND AGAIN HOW ANY PEOPLE WILL TURN OUT TO ELECTIONS IF THEY

01:17:29 FEEL DISENCHANTED WITH POLITICS VERSUS POLICY? JONATHAN:

01:17:31 DOESN'T THIS GET PEOPLE TO GO TO THE POLLS BECAUSE THEY ARE

01:17:32 SO FED UP WITH WHO'S IN CONGRESS NOW? LISA:

01:17:35 AND THEN WHO DO THEY VOTE IN? JONATHAN: MORE OF THE SAME?

01:17:40 POLITICIANS ARE SELF-INTERESTED PEOPLE WHO ONLY WANT TO GET

01:17:41 REELECTED, REALLY?

01:17:42 LISA: WE DON'T NEED TO GO HERE, BUT

01:17:46 THERE IS FRUSTRATION AND PEOPLE ARE WATCHING THIS BECAUSE IT

01:17:51 DETERMINES A LOT OF THE FUNDING AND FOR MARKETS HOW YOU

01:17:56 JONATHAN: I'M SHOCKED THOSE PEOPLE EXIST.

01:18:02 LET'S GET TO DEUTSCHE BANK, THE DROP IN THE CALL FOR U.S.

01:18:03 RECESSION. THE CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST SAYING THAT THE

01:18:07 ECONOMY PERFORMED AS WELL AS IT COULD HAVE LAST YEAR AND, WE

01:18:10 NOW THINK THAT THE ECONOMY WILL LAND ON THIS NARROW PATH AND A

01:18:13 RECESSION WILL BE AVERTED WITH LIMITED COST IN THE LABOR

01:18:15 MARKET. THOUGH INFLATION COULD FIRM

01:18:18 SOME IN THE NEAR TERM, WE ULTIMATELY BELIEVE THAT IT IS

01:18:22 SUSTAINABLY FALLING TOWARDS THE FED'S TARGET.

01:18:24 WE HAVE TO REFRAME THIS. WHAT A CHANGE OF THIS IS FOR

01:18:27 DEUTSCHE BANK, WHO GOING BACK TO APRIL OF 2022 SAID LATE 2023

01:18:33 RECESSION THAT WE HAVE THE FED CALL RIGHT AND INTEREST RATES

01:18:36 WOULD GO BETWEEN 5% AND 6%. NAILED THAT.

01:18:40 PRETTY MUCH LIKE EVERYONE ELSE GOT THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT

01:18:42 MOVE TOTALLY WRONG. THEY THOUGHT THAT WE WOULD HAVE

01:18:45 TO SEE PAIN IN THE LABOR MARKET AND UNEMPLOYMENT BELOW 4% FOR

01:18:47 TWO YEARS. THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO SEE THAT

01:18:52 IN INFLATION BACK DOWN TO 2%. THERE IS A HOPE THAT WE CAN

01:18:54 RECEIVE THESE WITHOUT A RECESSION. LISA:

01:18:59 MAKING THAT THEIR BASE CASE SAYING UNEMPLOYMENT WILL RISE

01:19:04 TO 4.1% VERSUS THE EXPECTATION FOR MORE MATERIAL INCREASE IN

01:19:05 UNEMPLOYMENT. THIS IS WHAT YOU FEEL UNDER THE

01:19:08 HOOD AND IT RAISES THE QUESTION WHAT DOES IT DO FOR POLICY

01:19:10 RATES? THEY SAY THAT IT MEANS THAT THE

01:19:14 FED CAN CUT BY 100 BASIS POINTS. I BELIEVE IT WAS 105 BEFORE

01:19:17 THIS . LONGER-TERM, THIS IS KEY, WHAT

01:19:21 DOES THIS MEAN ABOUT WHERE THE RATE CAN BE TO KEEP THE ECONOMY

01:19:23 CHUGGING ALONG? IT USED TO BE 3%.

01:19:28 NOW 3.5 PERCENT MAYBE 4% OVER LONGER TERM.

01:19:31 TO ME, THIS IS ONE OF THE KEY QUESTIONS AS PEOPLE REASSESS

01:19:33 REFINANCING ON HOW SUSTAINABLE SOME OF THE RATES ARE. JONATHAN:

01:19:38 A GAME CHANGER FOR THE STOCK MARKET, TOO.

01:19:39 THERE IS A HOPE THAT WE ARE GOING BACK TO THE OLD WORLD

01:19:44 PRE-2020 AND CAN GET GOING IN THE EQUITY MARKET.

01:19:46 THAT'S A BIG CHALLENGE. A CHALLENGE TO WHAT IS A

01:19:49 QUESTION I KEEP ASKING. A CHALLENGE TO BIG TECH WHICH

01:19:52 ARE BLOWING IT OUT OF THE WATER WHEN IT COMES TO EARNINGS, OR

01:19:54 TO FINANCIALS WHICH REALLY STRUGGLED LAST YEAR?

01:19:58 LISA: A GREAT QUESTION. I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER.

01:20:03 IF I DID I PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE HERE, BUT IT WILL BE

01:20:05 INTERESTING IF THE RUSSELL 2000 IS A TEA LEAF OF WHAT IS TO

01:20:06 COME. SOME OF THE BUSINESSES HAVEN'T

01:20:11 HAD TO FULLY REFINANCE OR FACE THE MUSIC OR DIVERT CASH AWAY

01:20:14 FROM THEIR EQUITY HOLDERS AND PUT IT TOWARDS THEIR

01:20:17 DEBTHOLDERS AS THEY REASSESS A NEW PLATFORM.

01:20:19 IS THAT WHAT THE DEVALUATION IS SOMETHING OUT? JONATHAN:

01:20:26 MATT, THANK YOU FOR SENDING OVER THAT CALL, A FASCINATING

01:20:27 READ. BOEING COME EXECUTIVES DEALING

01:20:32 WITH AN ONGOING SAFETY FALLOUT COULD HAVE A FALLOUT.

01:20:37 THE LARGEST UNION SET TO DEMAND A 40% PAY INCREASE OVER THE

01:20:39 THREE OR FOUR YEARS. HOPING TO CAPITALIZE ON A

01:20:42 RESURGENT U.S. LABOR MOVEMENT AND A SHORT

01:20:45 SUPPLY OF AEROSPACE WORKERS AND PRESSURE ON BOEING TO STABILIZE

01:20:47 WORK AT ITS FACTORIES. THE UNION'S WARNING OF

01:20:50 POTENTIAL STRIKES IN ORDER TO GET THEIR WISH.

01:20:53 MORE BAD NEWS FOR THIS COMPANY, POTENTIALLY. ANNMARIE:

01:20:58 HOW CAN THEY DEAL WITH THIS ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE?

01:21:01 THE UNION IS SAYING WE DO NOT TAKE STRIKING LIGHTLY BUT ARE

01:21:03 WILLING TO DO IT. IT SEEMS THAT THEY HAVE A LOT

01:21:05 OF LEVERAGE BECAUSE BOEING IS DEALING WITH A PLETHORA OF

01:21:06 ISSUES.

01:21:12 JONATHAN:

01:21:13 AFTER UAW WE ASK THE QUESTION, IS THIS A SIGN OF THE TIMES?

01:21:15 A NEW ERA? A REGIME OF LABOR POWER?

01:21:17 OR THE DYING EMBERS OF THE STORY OUT OF THE PANDEMIC?

01:21:19 WHICH IS IT? LISA: A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT

01:21:23 IS PROBABLY DYING EMBERS. I WOULD POINT TO UPS EARNINGS

01:21:31 AND THAT THEY CUT, SIGNIFICANT CUTS, AFTER THEIR LABOR

01:21:38 NEGOTIATIONS.

01:21:39 JONATHAN: WE CAN COMPARE DATA WITH

01:21:40 ANECDOTES. SOME OF THE EXAMPLES THAT YOU

01:21:42 ARE SEEING FROM CORPORATE AMERICA, CUTS FROM ESTEE LAUDER

01:21:43 YESTERDAY AND THE BLOWOUT JOBS REPORT ON FRIDAY.

01:21:45 IT HAS BEEN EXAMPLE AFTER EXAMPLE OF COMPANIES NOT HIRING

01:21:47 BUT FIRING. JONATHAN: YOU SEE THIS IN THE TECH SPACE

01:21:52 AS WELL. I WAS READING ABOUT THIS

01:21:55 YESTERDAY TALKING ABOUT UNDER THE LABOR MARKET HOW MUCH IS

01:22:01 SEASONAL AND HOW MUCH IS REALLOCATING TO OTHER AREAS.

01:22:02 ERASES THE QUESTION ABOUT THE HEADLINE NUMBERS. JONATHAN:

01:22:07 YIELDS ARE BASICALLY UNCHANGED AFTER RECORDING THEIR BIGGEST

01:22:14 TOD -- BIGGEST TWO DAY IN MONTHS.

01:22:20 TRAINS ARE NO MORE IN LINE WITH OUR VIEW OF 75 BASIS POINTS OF

01:22:21 CUTS THIS YEAR. MORE VALUE ALONG THE CURVE THEN

01:22:27 WHEN FED FUTURES CALLED FOR UPWARDS OF SIX RATE CUTS.

01:22:30 I'M PLEASED TO SAY WE ARE JOINED FOR MORE.

01:22:33 DEBORAH, THE MARCH MEETING. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE POURING

01:22:38 COLD WATER OVER IT, BUT THIS COULD BE INTERESTING.

01:22:40 I KNOW YOU ARE INTERESTED THERE WILL BE A BIG CONVERSATION

01:22:41 ABOUT THE BALANCE SHEET AND MAY BE WINDING DOWN QT?

01:22:49 >> I THINK THAT THERE WILL BE MORE DETAILS ON HOW THE QT

01:22:54 PROCESS GOES FORWARD FOR THE REST OF 2024 INTO 2020 FIVE.

01:23:02 I THINK THAT WILL BE THE FOCUS OF THE MEETING.

01:23:04 THE RESILIENCE OF THE ECONOMY, THE JOBS NUMBER THAT WE JUST

01:23:09 SAW, WE GET ANOTHER LABOR REPORT, OBVIOUSLY, BEFORE THE

01:23:13 MARCH MEETING. SO, ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

01:23:15 WHAT HAPPENS FROM AN INFLATION PERSPECTIVE GOING INTO THE

01:23:19 MARCH MEETING, I THINK THAT THOSE WILL BE TOP OF MIND.

01:23:24 HAVING SAID THAT, I DON'T SEE MUCH CHANGE IN THE CURRENT PATH

01:23:29 THAT WE ARE SEEING, WHICH IS CONTINUED WAGE INFLATION AND

01:23:31 CONTINUED STRENGTH FROM AN EMPLOYMENT PERSPECTIVE.

01:23:39 MAYBE SOME STICKINESS FROM AN INFLATION PERSPECTIVE GIVEN

01:23:41 WHERE WE ARE FROM A WAGE INFLATION AND RENTS PERSPECTIVE.

01:23:46 WE WERE TALKING ABOUT FROM UNION AND THE UAW SETTLEMENT

01:23:52 EARLIER THIS YEAR, OR LAST YEAR, WHAT IS GOING ON WITH

01:23:55 BOEING NOW, IT SEEMS LIKE THE STAGE IS SET FOR THE FED TO

01:24:00 HAVE A SLOW DECLINE IN RATES. NOTHING PRECIPITOUS.

01:24:08 NOTHING THAT IS -- MEETING AFTER MEETING STARTING IN THE

01:24:11 SPRING OF THIS YEAR WE ARE OF THE OPINION IT IS THE SECOND

01:24:12 HALF OF THAT. LISA: YOU ARE THE KEY PERSON THAT I

01:24:17 WANTED TO SPEAK TO BECAUSE IF RATES ARE NOT GOING TO GO DOWN

01:24:23 SO QUICKLY, IS THERE SO MUCH CASH ON THE SIDELINES OR IS IT

01:24:26 HAPPILY PARKED IN MONEY MARKET ACCOUNTS AND SHORT-TERM DEBT?

01:24:29 DEBORAH: I THINK IT IS HAPPILY PARKED.

01:24:33 IF YOU LOOK AT THE MONEY MARKET INDUSTRY LAST YEAR, $1 TRILLION.

01:24:40 DEPOSITS LOST $1 TRILLION. THAT IS NOT A COINCIDENCE.

01:24:45 THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE SAID ABOUT WHAT CAME OUT OF DEPOSITS

01:24:48 AND WITH INTO MONEY MARKET FUNDS.I'M NOT SAYING THAT THERE

01:24:49 IS NO CASH ON THE SIDELINES. THERE CERTAINLY IS THOSE WHO

01:24:54 ARE USING THE LIQUIDITY MARKETS AND MONEY MARKETS AS A SAFE

01:25:01 HAVEN IN THE CONTEXT OF NO LONGER IN THE EQUITY MARKET,

01:25:04 LONGER-TERM FIXED INCOME MARKET. THE RESILIENCE IN THE MARKET

01:25:10 FROM A CASH LONGEVITY STANDPOINT IS THERE. LISA:

01:25:17 HOW MUCH OF THE $6 TRILLION IN MONEY MARKETS WILL FLOW INTO

01:25:18 RISK ASSETS LATER THIS YEAR? THAT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE BULL

01:25:23 CASES FOR A LOT OF STOCKMARKET PROGNOSTICATORS.

01:25:27 HOW MUCH DO YOU VIEW THIS AS SOMETHING THAT HINGES ON

01:25:38 FEDERICO IT'S -- FED RECATE CUTS VERSUS A FALLACIOUS

01:25:42 STATEMENT? DEBORAH:DEBORAH: THE FLOW CAME FROM RETAIL AND

01:25:47 CAME OUT OF DEPOSITS. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE FED

01:25:52 PLATEAUS FROM A RATE STANDPOINT AND IT GOES DOWN THE OTHER SIDE?

01:25:56 INSTITUTIONAL CASH COMES INTO THE MARKETPLACE.

01:25:59 IT COMES OUT OF DIRECT SECURITIES BECAUSE DEREK

01:26:04 SECURITIES ARE NOW LOWER -- DIRECT SECURITIES ARE NOW LOWER.

01:26:12 ULTIMATELY, THERE MAY BE SOME AMOUNT, LET'S CALL IT A COUPLE

01:26:20 HUNDRED BILLION, THAT FLOWS OUT BECAUSE OF THE RE-ENTRANCE INTO

01:26:23 THE RISKIER ASSET MARKETS. HAVING SAID THAT, I THINK THAT

01:26:27 THE ASSETS IN THESE PRODUCTS CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN 2024

01:26:33 GIVEN WHAT OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR RATE CUTS OF 75 BASIS POINTS TO

01:26:35 MAYBE 100. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT RATES AT

01:26:39 THE END OF THE YEAR OF 4% TO 4.5%. JONATHAN:

01:26:43 IN THE MEANTIME, NO RATE CUTS UNTIL MAY BE THE MIDDLE OF THE

01:26:45 YEAR BASED ON HOW THE CONSENSUS IS SHIFTING? DEBORAH:

01:26:48 THAT IS OUR OUTLOOK AT THIS POINT. JONATHAN:

01:26:52 LET'S FINISH ON THE BANKING SYSTEM.

01:26:56 GIVEN THE BANK LENDING PROCESS IMPLEMENTED BY THE FEDERAL

01:26:59 RESERVE LAST YEAR SET TO EXPIRE LAST MONTH, HOW MUCH STRESS IS

01:27:02 ACCUMULATING IN THE REGIONAL BANKS AT THE MARKET BASED ON

01:27:04 YOUR READ OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS? DEBORAH:

01:27:09 JONATHAN, IT SEEMS LIKE THE LARGER REGIONAL BANKS ARE QUITE

01:27:16 FULSOME AT THIS POINT AND DON'T HAVE THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC RISKS

01:27:21 AND CONCENTRATION THAT SOMETHING LIKE MORE OF THE

01:27:25 COMMUNITY REGIONAL BANKS HAVE.

01:27:31 THE SYSTEM, THE BANK TERM FUNDING PROGRAM, WAS DESIGNED

01:27:34 FOR THE LARGER REGIONAL BANKS AND RIGHT NOW THEY SEEM TO HAVE

01:27:36 MUCH LESS STRESS. THEIR STRESS CAME LAST YEAR

01:27:44 BECAUSE OF THE RAPIDLY RISING RATE ENVIRONMENT AND THAT IS

01:27:46 BEHIND US AT THIS POINT. THEIR PORTFOLIO SHOULD BE BACK

01:27:53 TO THE TRADITIONAL STRESSES, THE LOAN PORTFOLIO.

01:27:56 FOR THE MOST POINT THEY ARE WELL DIVERSIFIED. JONATHAN:

01:27:59 THANK YOU FOR JOINING US EARLY THIS MORNING.

01:28:03 I SAY EARLY BECAUSE DEBORAH HAS SUCH A MORE ACTIVE SOCIAL LIFE

01:28:04 THAN I DO. OVERNIGHT AT A CONCERT, WHAT

01:28:09 TIME DID YOU GO TO SLEEP LAST NIGHT? LISA:

01:28:12 I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. JONATHAN: GOOD FOR THEM.

01:28:18 EQUITIES ON THE S&P NEGATIVE BY ALMOST .1%.

01:28:21 AN UPDATE ON STORIES, HERE'S YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF.

01:28:25 DANI: BLOOMBERG IS REPORTING THAT

01:28:27 BEHIND THE SCENES TALKS BETWEEN THE NEW YORK COMMUNITY BANK AND

01:28:31 U.S. WATCHDOG LED TO THE SURPRISE

01:28:34 DECISION TO HOARD CASH AND SLASH THE DIVIDEND.

01:28:36 THE DRASTIC MOVES LAST WEEK WERE PART OF AN EXPECTED

01:28:38 TRANSITION TO TOUGHER CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. N.Y.C.

01:28:45 BE TOOK ON RISKIER LOANS AND COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE.

01:28:48 TOYOTA'S MARKET VALUE HAS CLIMBED TO A NEW HIGH TOPPING

01:28:54 ¥50 TRILLION FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ITS HISTORY.

01:28:56 JUST UNDER $40 BILLION. IT JUMPED IN REACTION BETWEEN

01:28:59 UPWARD REVISION IN THE PROFIT GUIDANCE.

01:29:01 SHARES ARE UP ALL OVER THE YEAR ON THE BACK OF STRONG SALES AND

01:29:04 A WEAKER YEN. THE NEW GUIDANCE EXCEEDED

01:29:07 ANALYST ESTIMATES. ASTON MARKET IS SHAKING UP

01:29:08 THEIR C-SUITE AGAIN. THE COMPANY IS SEARCHING FOR

01:29:13 ITS FOURTH CEO IN FOUR YEARS. ACCORDING TO BLOOMBERG SOURCES,

01:29:18 CURRENT HEADS OF OTHER LUXURY AUTOMAKERS HAVE BEEN CONTACTED

01:29:23 TO SECEDE THE CURRENT CEO. HE HAS BEEN THE CEO OF ASTON

01:29:28 MARTIN SINCE 2022. THAT IS YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF.

01:29:31 JONATHAN: FOUR CEOS IN FOUR YEARS.

01:29:34 AT THIS POINT, DO YOU GET A NEW RECRUITER? LISA:

01:29:38 AT A CERTAIN POINT YOU HAVE TO COME UP WITH A NEW THESIS AS TO

01:29:39 WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR. JONATHAN:

01:29:43 UP NEXT ON THIS PROGRAM, MORE HEADWINDS FOR BOEING.

01:29:46 >> WE CAUSED THE PROBLEM. WE INSTITUTED ADDITIONAL

01:29:50 QUALITY CONTROLS AND INSPECTIONS AT BOEING AND OUR

01:29:54 SUPPLIER. JONATHAN: LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY, THIS

01:29:57 IS BLOOMBERG.

01:30:03 ♪

01:30:21 JONATHAN: EQUITIES ON THE S&P 500 FUTURES

01:30:22 ARE TOUCH NEGATIVE DOWN BY 0.04%.

01:30:25 IF YOU WANT A MOVER, CHECK OUT

01:30:32 SHARES OF HERTZ, DOWN BY 7%. LISA: REPORTINGLISA:

01:30:35 BIGGER THAN EXPECTED LOSSES BECAUSE OF LIQUOR VEHICLES.

01:30:41 OFFLOADING ABOUT ONE THIRD OF ITS FLEET AND TALKING ABOUT HOW

01:30:43 EXPENSIVE IT WAS TO REPAIR THEM. RESIDUAL VALUES WERE DECLINING.

01:30:49 THE CEO SAID WE CONTINUE TO FACE HEADWINDS RELATED TO OUR

01:30:51 ELECTRIC VEHICLE FLEET AND OTHER COSTS THROUGHOUT THE

01:30:54 QUARTER AFTER PREVIOUSLY HAVING BEEN THE ONE TO LEAD THE CHARGE

01:30:56 THIS WAY. IT SHOWS THE HICCUPS AND

01:30:58 GROWING PAINS IN THE TRANSITION. JONATHAN:

01:31:06 THE PUSH TO EV FOR HERTZ WAS ONE PART SEEING THE FUTURE AND

01:31:08 ONE PART MARKETING GIMMICK. YOU GET TOM BRADY ON BOARD,

01:31:13 LET'S GET AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE. WHAT YOU SAID I THINK IS THE

01:31:17 CRITICAL ELEMENT, THAT WE DID NOT DISCUSS ENOUGH, THE COST OF

01:31:20 KEEPING THESE VEHICLES ARE THE LOSS OF VALUE OVER

01:31:24 TIME. THAT WAS BEHIND THIS DECISION,

01:31:26 NOT JUST THAT CONSUMER DEMAND WAS NOT THERE IN THE WAY THAT

01:31:27 THEY ANTICIPATED. IT WAS THOSE ISSUES TOO. LISA:

01:31:32 WHEN I WAS THINKING OF BUYING A CAR THERE WAS THE QUESTION IF

01:31:36 YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE EV'S THAT WILL BE MORE DEVELOPED AND

01:31:39 CHEAPER LATER ON, WHY ARE YOU GOING TO HOLD ONTO IT NOW IF

01:31:41 YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE SAME KIND OF VALUE LATER?

01:31:44 THIS HAS BEEN A REAL CONCERN THAT YOU CAN SEE A PRACTICE

01:31:48 THAT HERTZ.

01:31:49 ANNMARIE: THEY BOUGHT 100,000 WANT TO GET

01:31:54 TO BE A MASSIVE PUSH INTO THE MARKET BUT THE DEMAND ISN'T

01:31:57 THERE. YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF DEALERS

01:32:01 WRITING TO THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION SAYING THAT YOU

01:32:04 NEED TO SLOW DOWN ON THIS AMBITIOUS PLAN OR THE ELECTRIC

01:32:06 VEHICLE GRID OF THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE THE DEMAND IS

01:32:08 NOT THERE. THERE IS A LOT OF RANGE ANXIETY

01:32:14 AND THE COST IS AN ISSUE. WE ARE SEEING THE FALLOUT OF

01:32:15 POTENTIALLY MOVING TOO FAST ON THE TRANSITION. JONATHAN:

01:32:20 DID WE SAY THAT THE RANGE ANXIETY WAS A CONSEQUENCE OF

01:32:21 THE MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN? LISA: RANGE ANXIETY SOUNDS LIKE

01:32:25 SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS TO A DOG. JONATHAN:

01:32:28 THE DEALERSHIPS RIGHT TO MARRY BARROW SAYING THAT WE WANT THE

01:32:32 HYBRIDS. MARY BARRA, WHAT DID YOU TALK

01:32:34 ABOUT? LISA: HYBRIDS.

01:32:40 THERE IS A REALITY CHECK. IS IT A BUMP IN THE ROAD OR

01:32:44 DOES IT CHANGE THE COURSE IN THE ROAD?

01:32:45 A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY IT IS A BUMP IN THE ROAD. JONATHAN:

01:32:49 HERTZ IS DOWN BY 6.9%. MORE HEADWINDS FOR BOEING.

01:32:56 >> WE CAUSED THE PROBLEM AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT.

01:33:01 WE INSTITUTED ADDITIONAL QUALITY CONTROLS AND

01:33:05 INSPECTIONS AT BOEING AND OUR SUPPLIER.

01:33:09 WE ISSUED TO STRENGTHEN THE PERFORMANCE. JONATHAN:

01:33:12 THE LATEST THIS MORNING, THE COMPANY FINDING MORE

01:33:17 MIS-DRILLED HOLES IN THE FUSELAGES OF THE 747 AT BOEING

01:33:22 IS FACING A POTENTIAL LABOR BATTLE WITH UNION LEADERS

01:33:24 ASKING FOR A 40% PAY BOOST FOR WORKERS OVER THE NEXT THREE TO

01:33:27 FOUR YEARS. THE FAA ADMINISTRATOR MIKE

01:33:31 WHITAKER IS SET TO TESTIFY ON CAPITOL HILL TODAY.

01:33:33 PREPARED REMARKS HE SAID THE FAA WILL CONSIDER THE FULL

01:33:36 EXTENT OF OUR ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY TO ENSURE THAT BOEING

01:33:40 IS HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR ANY NONCOMPLIANCE.

01:33:43 GEORGE FERGUSON SENIOR, AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE ANALYST

01:33:45 OF BLOOMBERG INTELLIGENCE, JOINS US FOR MORE.

01:33:47 CAN YOU FRAME HOW MUCH OF A NIGHTMARE THIS MIGHT BE FOR

01:33:50 BOEING LATER TODAY? GEORGE: NO CEO WOULD WANT THIS TO BE

01:33:56 HAPPENING, BUT I DON'T THINK THERE IS MUCH CHOICE.

01:34:00 THE FAA, THEIR REPUTATION HAS BEEN HURT BY BOEING.

01:34:04 I THINK AS THE REGULATOR THEY NEED TO GET IN THERE AND MAKE

01:34:08 SURE THAT THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS IS STABLE AND THAT

01:34:11 BOEING IS BUILDING SAFE AIRPLANES.

01:34:13 IF WE HAD A PROBLEM, GOD FORBID, PART OF IT WOULD BE ON

01:34:17 THE FAA'S HANDS. NO CEO WOULD WANT THIS TO BE

01:34:20 GOING ON, BUT I THINK IT IS NECESSARY AT THIS POINT.

01:34:25 I THINK A LOT OF IT WILL BE ABOUT INCREASED OVERSIGHT AT

01:34:28 BOEING, AT THE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, AND THERE WILL ALSO

01:34:30 BE QUESTIONS FOR THE FAA. IF THEY HAVE THE PERSONNEL IN

01:34:36 PLACE AND THE RESOURCES TO GO OUT AND PROPERLY OVERSEE. LISA:

01:34:41 IS IT THE JOB OF THE FAA OR BOEING TO MAKE SURE THAT PLANES

01:34:42 ARE SAFE? GEORGE: AT THE END OF THE DAY IT IS

01:34:47 BOEING'S JOB TO BUILD AN AIRPLANE ACCORDING TO WHAT THEY

01:34:51 HAVE HAD CERTIFIED BY THE FAA. IT IS BOEING'S JOB TO BUILD A

01:34:57 SAFE AIRPLANE AND BUILD IT CORRECTLY, BUT IT IS THE FAA'S

01:34:59 RESPONSIBILITY TO OVERSEE THAT PROCESS. SO, THERE NEEDS TO BE

01:35:04 APPROPRIATE CONTROLS IN PLACE AND INSPECTIONS IN PLACE SO

01:35:09 THAT THEY CAN FEEL SATISFIED THAT THE WORK IS BEING DONE

01:35:11 ACCORDING TO THEIR AUTHORIZATIONS.

01:35:28 LISA: WE WERE TALKING WITH SOME OF

01:35:29 THE LABOR ISSUES AND THE POTENTIAL FOR A STRIKE AND I

01:35:30 WONDER HOW MUCH THIS IS YET ANOTHER PROBLEM AND HOW MUCH

01:35:31 THIS IS CENTRAL TO THE PROBLEMS. HOW MUCH IS BOEING'S

01:35:32 ISSUE A WORKFORCE PROBLEM WITH RESPECT TO MORE ROW, RETENTION,

01:35:32 AND FULL STAFFING? GEORGE: A LOT OF IT IS WORKFORCE.

01:35:33 EVERYONE THAT I TALKED TO IN THE INDUSTRY TALKS ABOUT THE

01:35:38 TURNOVER THAT WE HAD DURING THE PANDEMIC AND THE DIFFICULTY

01:35:39 GETTING WORKERS EVEN NOW. THE UNIONS ARE GOING TO HAVE

01:35:45 PLENTY OF LEVERAGE.

01:35:51 THE WORKFORCE STILL SEEMS -- OR AT LEAST THE U.S.

01:35:55 WORKFORCE SEEMS LIKE THERE ARE SHORTAGES IN SOME AREAS.

01:35:56 I WOULD EXPECT THEM TO GET A NICE PAY PACKAGE.

01:36:01 THE PRIMARY CHALLENGE HERE IS THE TURNOVERS REALLY DEPLETED

01:36:05 THE AMOUNT OF EXPERIENCE ON THE LINE AND THEY NEED TO BE ABLE

01:36:08 TO RETAIN THAT EXPERIENCE SO THAT THEY CAN BUILD AIRPLANES

01:36:13 WILL.

01:36:14 AIRCRACKED MANY FACTORING IS DIFFERENT THAN OTHER TYPES OF

01:36:17 MANUFACTURING WHERE YOU CAN DO HIGHER VOLUMES AND MORE

01:36:18 TEMPLATING.

01:36:24 YOU BUY MORE CAPITAL TOOLS THAT WILL HELP MAKE UP FOR ANY

01:36:27 DEFICIENCIES IN THE WORKFORCE. THERE IS A LOT OF MANUAL LABOR

01:36:33 THAT IS NOT CAPITAL TOOLS ACCOMPANIED IN THIS BUSINESS.

01:36:36 SO YOU NEED SMART, WELL-TRAINED PEOPLE ON THE LINE FOCUSED ON

01:36:38 DETAIL. IT'S HARD TO DO. THEY WILL PROBABLY GET A NICE

01:36:41 PACKAGE. JONATHAN: WHAT ARE WE MISSING NOW THAT WE

01:36:45 USED TO HAVE BEFORE THE PANDEMIC? GEORGE:

01:36:49 A LOT OF GREY-HAIRED EXPERIENCED FOLKS ON THE LINE.

01:36:53 PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC WE SAW A LOT OF SEASONED PROFESSIONALS

01:36:58 ON THE LINES. DURING THE PANDEMIC THEY LEFT.

01:37:01 I GUESS THEY DECIDED THEY WOULD MOVE TO JACKSONVILLE OR

01:37:02 SOMETHING. I'M JUST SAYING THAT THEY WENT

01:37:08 TO SUNNIER SHORES IN THE

01:37:15 NORTHWEST. THEY WERE IN AN INDUSTRY THAT SAW THE CRASHES,

01:37:19 THE MAX WAS GROUNDED, THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW YOU GET INTO A

01:37:25 PANDEMIC, AIR TRAVEL GOES TO ALMOST ZERO, PEOPLE JUST THROW

01:37:27 UP THEIR HANDS AND SAID THAT’'S IT. I'M 62, BOEING IS GOING TO

01:37:32 OFFER ME A PACKAGE BECAUSE THEY ARE TRYING TO CUT LONGER-TERM

01:37:33 COSTS. I WILL TAKE THE PACKAGE, MOVE

01:37:36 OUT, DO SOMETHING ELSE. THEY HAD TO TURN OVER THAT

01:37:42 STAFF AND BRING IN NEW PEOPLE, TRAIN THEM, AND THAT HAS BEEN A

01:37:43 SERIOUS CHALLENGE.

01:37:45 JONATHAN: IT IS GOOD TO CATCH UP.

01:37:49 GEORGE FERGUSON OF BLOOMBERG INTELLIGENCE ON THE CHALLENGES

01:37:54 FOR BOEING AND ALSO SPIRIT AEROSYSTEMS. SPIRIT SUSPENDING

01:37:55 GUIDANCE. NO SURPRISE. WE SAW THE SAME THING FROM

01:37:57 BOEING. LISA: HOW CAN THEY PROVIDE GUIDANCE?

01:38:03 THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THE PARAMETERS OF THE REGULATORY

01:38:05 REGIME AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE BLAME IS.

01:38:08 I WONDER WHY THIS HASN'T BEEN A MORE TALKED ABOUT AREA?

01:38:12 IT HAS BEEN ALL BOEING AND NOT SOME OF THEIR SUBCONTRACTORS.

01:38:16 THIS ASSUMPTION IS THEY WILL STAY SUBCONTRACTORS AND FIGURED

01:38:17 OUT. JONATHAN:

01:38:23 THE BOOKS THAT WILL BE WRITTEN ABOUT THE PANDEMIC AND THE

01:38:25 PEOPLE WHO WERE TIRED AND ARE ALMOST IRREPLACEABLE. LISA:

01:38:28 IT IS SUCH A HUMAN STORY. WE TALK ABOUT THESE NUMBERS BUT

01:38:33 THIS IS A HUMAN ISSUE BECAUSE IT IS A DETAILED CRAFT

01:38:35 FOCUSED-TYPE OF PRACTICE. JONATHAN:

01:38:37 THE BEACHES OF FLORIDA. LISA: NOT JUST ANYWHERE, JACKSONVILLE.

01:38:43 JONATHAN:

01:39:03 >> THIS MARKET IS EXTREMELY POWERFUL TO THE UPSIDE.

01:39:07 >> WHAT WE WILL SEE IS A BROADENING OUT IN QUALITY.

01:39:12 >> WHAT HAPPENS IS A BROADENING TO OTHER AREAS OF THE MARKET

01:39:14 WHICH ARE NOT AS RISKY AS WE THINK.

01:39:18 >> WHEN WE THINK ABOUT BROADENING OUT WE THINK THERE

01:39:20 IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SMALL-CAP TO CATCH UP.

01:39:23 >> THE MARKET IS READY AND WANTS TO ROTATE.

01:39:28 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE WITH JONATHAN

01:39:30 FERRO, LISA ABRAMOWICZ AND ANNMARIE HORDERN. JONATHAN:

01:39:34 THERE IS A GROUP OF THAT -- OF INVESTORS THAT WANT IT TO

01:39:36 ROTATE.

01:39:37 THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE ALONG WITH LISA ABRAMOWICZ AND

01:39:42 ANNMARIE HORDERN. THE EQUITY MARKET ALMOST

01:39:44 UNCHANGED. ALL OF THAT TALK ABOUT

01:39:50 ROTATION, GOING AWAY FROM BIG TECH AND GOING ELSEWHERE.

01:39:54 YEAR TO DATE EQUAL WEIGHT IS DOWN ON THE YEAR.

01:39:57 THE MAX SEVEN IS UP BY 8% OR 9%. ANNMARIE:

01:40:02 THE ROTATION IS AWAY FROM THE SEVEN. JONATHAN:

01:40:07 WHO IS IT, META, MICROSOFT? LISA: NVIDIA AND AMAZON.

01:40:12 JONATHAN: HOW MUCH IS THAT DISTORTING

01:40:13 WHAT IS HAPPENING ELSEWHERE. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT GOOD NEWS

01:40:18 BEING GOOD NEWS, HAS IT BEEN FOR THE STOCK MARKET? LISA:

01:40:23 NOT FOR A LOT OF THE SMALL CAPS OR OTHER SMALL STOCKS.

01:40:26 WE HAVE NOT SEEN THAT ROTATION AND THAT IS THE BOTTOM LINE.

01:40:29 IT FEELS LIKE DEJA VU ALL OVER AGAIN.

01:40:33 IT FEELS LIKE WE GET SOME SORT OF WEAKNESS.

01:40:37 BUT IT PUT 2023 ON REPEAT. JONATHAN:

01:40:40 WE WERE TALKING ABOUT NO LANDING AND ON THE BACK OF ISM

01:40:44 SERVICES AND PAYROLLS AND BLOWOUT JOBS REPORTS.

01:40:47 TALKING ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF MOVING AWAY FROM GOLDILOCKS.

01:40:49 LISA: AND GETTING A NO LANDING. ARE WE JUST IN 2023 PRESS

01:40:56 REPEAT OR IS IT SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAT MAYBE SOMETHING

01:40:57 COMES TO THE MIDDLE OF THE YEAR? JONATHAN:

01:41:01 THE POLITICS ARE FASCINATING AND WHAT IS IT STARTING TO

01:41:03 SHAPE AND EQUITY MARKETS. YESTERDAY WE HEARD MCDONALD'S

01:41:08 COMPLAINING ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE MIDDLE EAST

01:41:10 AND IT WAS HURTING THEIR BOTTOM LINE. WE SAW IT FROM STARBUCKS.

01:41:15 WE HAVE HAD MCDONALD'S AND STARBUCKS.

01:41:19 WHICH ARE THE POSTER CHILD FOR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS FLYING

01:41:25 THE INTERNATIONAL FLAG.

01:41:27 ANNMARIE: YOU HAD BOYCOTT MCDONALD'S AND

01:41:29 STARBUCKS BECAUSE CUSTOMERS DID NOT LIKE WHAT THEY WERE SAYING

01:41:32 ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON BETWEEN ISRAEL AND GAZA AND ALSO

01:41:36 COCA-COLA. WE SPOKE TO THE CEO ABOUT THE

01:41:38 FACT THAT THEY ARE HAVING ISSUES IN TURKIYE.

01:41:41 TURKISH AIRLINES WANTED TO GET RID OF COCA-COLA.

01:41:44 HOW MUCH ARE THESE GOING TO BECOME BIGGER PROBLEMS GOING

01:41:48 INTO THIS YEAR IT NOT ONLY WITH THE ISRAEL BORN TO GAZA BUT

01:41:51 WITH A U.S. ELECTION THAT IS VERY TENUOUS

01:41:54 AND EMOTIONAL AND WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR CORPORATE AMERICA?

01:41:58 LISA: MCDONALD'S SAYS THAT IT WILL

01:41:59 CONTINUE AS LONG AS THE CONFLICT IS GOING ON BUT DID

01:42:03 NOT SAY THAT THEIR STORE SAW IMPACTS.

01:42:07 STARBUCKS SIDE OF 5% AND SAID THAT IT HAD TO DO WITH THIS.

01:42:10 JONATHAN: THIS GOES BACK TO WHAT WE

01:42:12 TALKED ABOUT, HOW MUCH WILL IT BE A CHALLENGE FOR

01:42:14 MULTINATIONAL. THIS IS JUST A POLITICS, NEVER

01:42:16 MIND THE ECONOMICS. EUROPE IS DREADFUL, CHINA IS A

01:42:20 CHALLENGE. APPLE SPOKE TO ALL OF THESE

01:42:23 THINGS AT THE SAME TIME. LISA: THIS IS WHY THEY WANT THINGS TO

01:42:28 GO BACK TO THE SMALL U.S. COMPANIES.

01:42:32 THIS IS A ROUNDABOUT REASON FOR EXACTLY WHY PEOPLE ARE CALLING

01:42:33 FOR BROADENING OUT. REALLY WHAT IT IS IS CONFUSION

01:42:37 FOR ALL OF THE STOCKS EXCEPT FOR THE MAG 4 AND 2, OR LET US

01:42:43 SEE HOW FAR IT TAKES FOR US TO HAVE A MAG 1.

01:42:47 AND THAT IS THE KIND OF THING THAT CONSISTENTLY WORKS.

01:42:49 JONATHAN: THE WHOLE MARKET IS STANDING ON

01:42:52 THE SHOULDERS OF NVIDIA 2024. EQUITY IS TOTALLY UNCHANGED.

01:42:57 ADJUSTMENT IN THE BOND MARKET AND WE WILL DISCUSS THAT IN A

01:43:03 MOMENT.

01:43:04 MOVING OVER 20 BASIS POINTS IN ALMOST 30 BASIS POINTS HIGHER.

01:43:07 ON A 10 YEAR FURTHER OUT, THE 10 YEAR ALMOST UNCHANGED AT

01:43:11 4.1481. THE DOLLAR IS JUST A TOUCH

01:43:12 STRONGER. 1.0 737.

01:43:18 COMING UP WELLS FARGO DELIVERING A REALITY CHECK FOR

01:43:22 MARKETS. LARA REIM ON HER SURGICAL RATE

01:43:28 CUT CALL AND HOBBY AIR BLAS -- JAVIER BLAS.

01:43:32 STOCKS INCHING BACK FROM ALL-TIME HIGHS AS WALL STREET

01:43:34 RETHINKS BEDS. RECENT DATA ONLY CONFIRMS THE

01:43:40 BELIEF THAT THE FIRST RATE CUT WOULD COME IN JUNE OR LABOR --

01:43:41 OR LATER. THE MARKET IS OVERLY OPTIMISTIC

01:43:47 ON THE NUMBER OF CUTS AND WHEN THEY START.

01:43:50 OUR VIEW IS THREE RATE CUTS STARTING IN THE SECOND HALF.

01:43:53 DARRELL I AM PLEASED TO SAY IS AROUND THE TABLE.

01:43:55 LET US TALK ABOUT THE RATE CUT CALLS. WE ARE STARTING TO SEE AN

01:44:01 ADJUSTMENT IN TWO YEARS -- TWO YEAR YIELDS PUSHING HIGHER.

01:44:05 HOW MUCH MORBID -- HOW MUCH MORE OF AN ADJUSTMENT WILL WE

01:44:07 BE SEEING? DARRELL: FOR THE STOCK MARKET TO BECOME

01:44:14 ATTRACTIVE I THINK YOU HAVE TO SEE SOMEWHERE IN THE

01:44:16 NEIGHBORHOOD OF 5% TO 8% DOWN FROM TODAY.

01:44:20 THAT IS NOT UNUSUAL TO GET THAT TWO TO 3% DEDUCTIONS.

01:44:23 IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE. REMEMBER, LET ME JUST BEEN YOU

01:44:26 BACK.

01:44:32 THIS TIME LAST YEAR THE CONSENSUS WAS 85% SAID WE WERE

01:44:36 HEADING TO A RECESSION, AND THE FED FUNDS FUTURE CURVES HAS

01:44:39 THREE INTEREST RATES PRICED INTO THE BACK HALF OF 2023.

01:44:41 WE KNOW THOSE NEVER HAPPENED.

01:44:43 HERE WE SAID THAT THE CONSENSUS IS THIS, SOFT LANDING AND FOUR

01:44:48 TO FIVE RATE CUTS. 10 TO 12% EARNINGS GROWTH.

01:44:52 WE HAVE SLAYED THE INFLATION BEAST. MY BET IS THAT WHEN WE

01:44:58 SPIN FORWARD AND LOOK BACKWARDS THAT CONSENSUS IS WRONG.

01:45:00 JONATHAN: A REPEAT OF LAST YEAR? DARRELL:

01:45:04 A REPEAT IN THE SENSE THAT THE FED CANNOT GIVE YOU THAT THE

01:45:09 MARKETS WANTS THE FED TO GIVE. IF YOU DESCRIBE THIS YEAR YEAR

01:45:13 TO DATE, IT HAS BEEN BORING. THE EQUITY MARKETS DRIFTED

01:45:15 HIGHER. THE VIX IS STILL LOW AND GOLD

01:45:21 HAS NOT BEEN AN ISSUE AND
