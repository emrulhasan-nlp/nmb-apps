00:15 JONATHAN: GOOD AFTERNOON, THE FED DECIDES

00:16 STARTS RIGHT NOW.

00:20 >> THIS IS A SPECIAL EDITION OF BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE WITH TOM

00:22 KEENE, JONATHAN FERRO AND LISA ABRAMOWICZ.

00:25 LUMBAR SURVEILLANCE, THE FED DECIDES. JONATHAN:

00:31 BACK IN THE HOT SEAT ALONGSIDE

00:38 LISA ABRAMOWICZ, YOUR EQUITY S&P 500.

00:40 IS A LITTLE SOFTER THE FED DECISION IS ABOUT 20 MINUTES A

00:43 DAY IN 30 MINUTES AFTER THAT A NEWS CONFERENCE WITH CHAIRMAN

00:48 POWELL. LISA: WHICH PARAGRAPH WILL CHANGE?

00:51 PEOPLE WILL PARSE THROUGH THE LANGUAGE IN -- AND HOW MUCH ARE

00:57 WE LOOKING AT A FED THAT HAS SHIFTED AWAY FROM DISINFLATION

01:01 ACCORDING TO THEIR PACE AND MOVING TOWARD CUTS NOT COMING

01:03 UNTIL LATER? JONATHAN: EVERYONE IS EXPECTING HIM TO BE

01:06 HAWKISH IN THIS NEWS CONFERENCE. HAWKISH RELATIVE TO WHAT?

01:12 RELATIVE TO THE PREVIOUS MEETING IS A LOBAR BUT RELATIVE

01:15 TO WHAT HE SAID PREVIOUSLY AND WHAT IS PRICED IN IS A MUCH

01:17 HIGHER BAR. TOM: WHAT I WILL GO BACK TO IS WHEN

01:20 THE FACTS CHANGE, THE MARKETS CHANGE.

01:25 WE GO INTO THIS MEETING IN THE MARKET HAS CHANGED.

01:29 I'VE GOT THE 10 YEAR REAL YIELD SINCE WE HAD OUR EXTRAVAGANT

01:31 LUNCH, 2.29%.

01:37 IT'S A RUNAWAY 10 YEAR REAL JONATHAN: JONATHAN: DEAL.

01:41 CHAIRMAN POWELL HAS ONE GEAR SO DOES HE NEED TO FIND ANOTHER?

01:45 THE 2-YEAR NOTE HAS RALLIED ON ALL OF THE LAST FOUR FOMC DAYS.

01:49 WILL TODAY BE ANY DIFFERENT? LISA:

01:53 THIS IS A FED CHAIR THAT IS LEANED DOVISH CONSISTENTLY.

01:59 WILL HE COME OUT AND SAY THEH WORD, HIKE?

02:03 WILL HE EMBRACE IT AND TALK ABOUT MAYBE THINGS GETTING

02:07 CONCERNING GIVEN THE FACT THAT INFLATION HAS BEEN ACCELERATING?

02:11 TOM: I'M TRANSFIXED BY MY NOMINATION

02:14 FOR ECONOMIST OF THE YEAR WHO SAYS GET OUT FRONT AND RAISE

02:17 RATES BUT THERE IS NO TEMPLATE FOR HIM TO DO THAT TODAY.

02:21 WE NEED TO SEE LOTS OF FED SPEEDS TO GET THERE. LISA:

02:23 I'M NOT SUGGESTING HE HIKE RATES TODAY BUT JUST ENTERTAIN

02:26 THE IDEA. JONATHAN: THAT'S OUT BEARISH TK THINK YOU

02:29 ARE. EQUITIES ON THE S&P 500 ARE NEGATIVE BY A QUARTER OF 1%.

02:37 OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS, WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK IN THE BOND

02:38 MARKET. THE TWO YEAR YIELD WAS 4.60 AND

02:43 AT THE MOMENT IT'S JUST NORTH OF 5%. LISA:

02:47 THERE IS A QUESTION ABOUT THE DATA COMING IN SHOWING WEAKER

02:50 ACTIVITY BUT STILL HOT INFLATION.

02:55 WE WILL PARSE ALL OF THIS WITH BOB MICHELE OF JP MORGAN THEN

02:58 KATHY JONES OF CHARLES SCHWAB. THEY WILL TAKE US UP TO THAT

03:01 2:00 P.M. FED RATE DECISION WHICH MAY OR

03:05 NOT BE INTERESTING DEPENDING WHICH PARAGRAPH GETS CHANGED

03:09 AND HOW MUCH. THEN WE WILL GET IMMEDIATE

03:13 REACTION FROM MOHAMED EL-ERIAN AND DIANE SWUNG AND MICHAEL

03:15 CAPON. WE WILL SEE WHETHER HE IS HAWKISH AND REMAINS DOVISH.

03:23 AFTER THAT, WE WILL TALK WITH THE FORMER NEW YORK FED

03:25 PRESIDENT BILL DUDLEY AND BLACKROCK'S JEFF ROSENBERG.

03:31 I'M CURIOUS TO SEE HOW MUCH WE WILL END UP GETTING SOME SORT

03:33 OF TRUE HAWKISH SHIFT AT A TIME WHEN SOME PEOPLE SPECULATE THE

03:37 MARKET NEEDS TO SELL OFF MORE FOR THEM TO ACHIEVE THEIR GOAL.

03:40 TOM: THERE ARE TWO GUESTS WHO NEED A

03:43 VICTORY LAP, MOHAMED EL-ERIAN AND BILL DUDLEY MAILED THE LAST

03:45 THREE YEARS. JONATHAN: IS THIS A SET UP FOR OUR NEXT

03:48 GUEST? TOM: NO, BUT THEY TOOK A LOT OF

03:53 GRIEF FOR A HIGH-YIELD CALL. JONATHAN:

03:57 TOM WAS ABOUT TO WALK UP THE SET.

04:01 >> I'VE CALLED FOR HIGH YIELDS IN 2021. LISA: YOU CRUSHED IT.

04:07 >> WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT NOT CALLING FOR RATE HIKES, THE

04:10 FIRST THING A THOUGHT ABOUT WAS IF WITH THIS WHERE THE VOLKER

04:12 ERIE, WE WOULD BE TALKING A RATE HIKES BECAUSE HE COULD

04:16 HAVE WALKED INTO DATE AND HIKE TO 50 BASIS POINTS.

04:18 WE WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN BECAUSE WE WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THE

04:22 MARKET OPERATIONS AND SEE HOW MUCH LIQUIDITY THEY HAVE.

04:24 IT'S NOT THE ENVIRONMENT WE ARE IN. JONATHAN:

04:29 HOW DIFFERENT IS THIS ENVIRONMENT TO CHAIRMAN POWELL?

04:33 >> IT'S GOT TO BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT AND HE HAS TO CHANGE

04:35 THAT FIRST PARAGRAPH. IT TALKS ABOUT OVER THE LAST

04:38 YEAR, INFLATION HAS REMAINED MODERATE.

04:42 TAKE OUT THE HAS EASED OVER THE LAST YEAR AND SAY IT REMAINS

04:43 ELEVATED. HE ALSO TALKED ABOUT ECONOMIC

04:49 ACTIVITY CONTINUING AT A SOLID PACE.

04:54 TAKE OUT SOLID PACE AND SAKE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IS NOT BAD.

04:57 THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

04:59 YOU HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT DISINFLATION HAS STALLED IN THE

05:03 CRISIS REMAINS ELEVATED AND YOU ALSO HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

05:08 WHILE BUSINESSES AND HOUSES LOOK OK, THEY ARE NOT AS

05:10 VIBRANT AS THEY WERE THREE OR FOUR MONTHS AGO. TOM:

05:16 YOU TALKED ABOUT 1995.

05:23 I RECALL THEN THAT THE DOW

05:29 JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE WAS 4000.

05:31 ARE WE SETTING OURSELVES UP FOR AN EQUITY MARKET OF WHAT THE

05:35 FED IS DOING LIKE 1995?

05:38 >> WE ARE IN A PRETTY SIMILAR SPACE.

05:41 I'M SURPRISED 95 DOESN'T GET MORE AIRTIME.

05:45 THAT'S THE ONE SOFT LANDING ANYBODY COULD HAVE LIVED

05:46 THROUGH UNLESS THEY ARE 100 YEARS OLD.

05:50 IN THAT TIMEFRAME, WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED,

05:58 THE FED STOPPED HIKING RATES AND IN FEBRUARY, THEY CUT RATES

06:00 IN JULY. THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT

06:10 UNCOMFORTABLE LEVELS INFLATION BOTH SURPRISING AND UNWELCOME.

06:11 IT SEEMS LIKE WE COULD BE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THING

06:13 FOR THIS MEETING. LISA:

06:19 THIS UNDERPINS HAVE CHAIR POWELL WILL MESSAGE THIS.

06:22 A MUCH DOES HE NEED THE MARKET TO SELLOFF A LITTLE BIT MORE

06:25 AND DOES IT HELP HIS CAUSE? DO YOU EXPECT HIM TO LEAN INTO

06:29 THAT OR WILL HE COME OUT AND TRY TO SAY WE WILL STILL CUT

06:33 RATES?

06:33 >> I DON'T THINK HE WILL SAY THAT AND I THINK HE WANTS TO BE

06:39 BALANCE. HE HAS THE MARKET TO WHERE HE

06:43 WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT GIVEN THE DATA THAT'S PRINTED OVER THE

06:44 LAST SIX WEEKS. YOU'VE GOT ONE RATE CUT PRICED

06:47 IN FOR THE YEAR AND THAT'S TOWARDS THE BACK END OF THE

06:51 YEAR. YOU'VE GOT 50 BASIS POINTS HIGHER IN 10 YEAR YIELDS OVER

06:56 THE PAST MONTH. THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT

07:02 SHOULD BE REFLECTED WITH INFLATION WHERE IT IS.

07:06 TRY TO FIND A BALANCE, TALK ABOUT ELEVATED INFLATION

07:10 PRESSURES AND MAYBE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REDUCE RATES

07:12 WHEN THOSE COME DOWN. LISA: IS THIS AN EXCITING MEETING OR

07:16 A PLACEHOLDER BEFORE JUNE?

07:19 >> I THINK IT IS AN EXCITING MEETING.

07:22 SINCE THE LAST MEETING, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT GROWTH HAS TAILED

07:26 OFF A LITTLE BIT. WE HAD A 1.6 PERCENT GDP GROWTH.

07:32 WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE STRESS AND LOWER INCOME

07:42 BRACKETS, MILLER AND WE ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE

07:46 PRINTING 3% INFLATION, ONLY 2% NOW.

07:49 WE ARE NOT SAYING THAT SO HE'S GOT TO ADDRESS THAT.

07:53 THEN THERE IS THAT MINOR DETAIL OF QUANTITATIVE TIGHTENING.

07:56 THEY ARE STILL RUNNING DOWN THE BALANCE SHEET AT A HIGH PACE.

07:58 WHY NOT USE THIS MEETING TO TELL US THEY WILL TAPER, THEY

08:04 ARE GOING TO REDUCE TREASURY SALES BY HALF AT ONE OF THE

08:05 UPCOMING MEETINGS. JONATHAN: IS THAT YOUR BASE CASE TODAY?

08:13 >> WE THINK WE WILL GET THAT ANNOUNCEMENT.

08:14 IF YOU GO BACK 13 MONTHS, IT SURPRISED A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT

08:18 AS THE REGIONAL BANKING SYSTEM WAS IMPLODING, THEY STILL WENT

08:21 TO HENAN HIKE RATES. WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT POLICY TO

08:28 THE SIDE OF THAT, I THINK THEY CAN DO THAT HERE.

08:30 THEY CAN TALK ABOUT BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT IS DIFFERENT

08:34 FROM THEIR DUAL MANDATE OF INFLATION AND GROWTH. JONATHAN:

08:38 WHAT DIFFERENCE WILL THAT MAKE IF THEY SLOW DOWN THE TAPER?

08:41 WHAT DOES THAT ACTUALLY MEAN?

08:45 >> I THINK PSYCHOLOGICALLY, IT WILL HELP THE MARKET SUPPORT AT

08:50 THESE LEVELS BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE LARGEST SELLERS

08:52 OF TREASURIES, IT IS THE U.S. TREASURY AND IT'S THE FED.

08:58 OTHERWISE, EVERYONE PRETTY MUCH IS A NET BUYER.

09:04 IF YOU ARE REMOVING HALF OF OIL LARGEST SELLERS OF TREASURIES,

09:08 THAT'S GOT TO BE THE SORT OF SOME SUPPORT EVEN IF IT'S ONLY

09:09 PSYCHOLOGICALLY.

09:16 WE'VE BEEN TOLD QT IS LIKE PAINT DRYING AND WHEN YOU

09:17 UNWIND SOME OF IT IT MATTERS. LISA:

09:23 HOW TO THE END QUANTITATIVE TIGHTENING WITHOUT HAVING A

09:25 DOVISH SIGNAL AND WITHOUT GIVING THE MARKET SOME SORT OF

09:28 SIGN THAT THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT OVERLY TIGHTENING THE

09:29 MARKET. IF IT COMES PSYCHOLOGICALLY

09:34 IMPORTANT TO A MARKET THAT'S TRYING TO UNDERSTAND SUPPLY AND

09:36 DEMAND DYNAMICS, I THINK THIS IS AN ISSUE. JONATHAN:

09:39 MICHAEL COME OVER TO YOU.

09:42 >> BECAUSE THEY SEPARATE THOSE TWO AND THEY SAY THEY CAN WALK

09:45 AND CHEW GUM AT THE SAME TIME.

09:52 BALANCE SHEET MANAGEMENT IS ONE THING AND DEALING WITH GROWTH

09:54 AND IMPLOSION PRESSURES IS ANOTHER THING.

09:59 WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SELLING OF TREASURIES IN THE RUNNING DOWN

10:01 OF THE BALANCE SHEET, IT DIDN'T DO THAT MUCH.

10:09 THEY ARE STILL TRADING WELL BELOW THE FED FUNDS RATE.

10:13 WHEN I GO TO JAPAN NEXT WEEK AND WITH A CONVERSATION WILL BE

10:16 THE WHAT IS THE ULTIMATE RESERVE C TO THE DOLLAR AND YOU

10:19 IS, THERE IS NOT. WHO IS GOING TO JAPAN.

10:29 LISA: ARE YOU GOING TO JAPAN? JONATHAN: I AM. JONATHAN:

10:35 YOU OVER WATCHING SHOW GUN? LISA: IT'S GREAT.

10:44 >> LET'S NOT GO THERE.

10:59 >> GONE FROM EXPECTING SIX OR SEVEN RATE CUTS TO MAYBE TWO.

11:03 >> CUTTING RATES IN JUNE OR JULY.

11:05 >> THE SECOND PART OF THE YEAR.

11:07 >> SURGICAL RATE CUTS.

11:10 >> THERE IS REALLY ONLY ONE MOVEMENT LEFT FOR THE YEAR.

11:13 >> THE LONGER THESE RATE CUTS ARE POSTPONED, MORE CREDENCE WE

11:16 GET TO THE POSSIBILITY OF RATE HIKES.

11:18 >> THAT LAST MILE IN INFLATION.

11:21 >> THEY ARE TRYING TO SAY THIS IS A BUMP IN THE ROAD.

11:26 >> POWELL WILL ASPIRE TO BE THE MOST BORING HE POSSIBLY CAN.

11:31 >> IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE FED TO DO ANYTHING

11:34 SHORT OF A HAWKISH MESSAGE.

11:37 >> HE WILL BE JUST AS HAWKISH AS HE WAS LAST TIME.

11:40 >> IF HE OPENS HIS MOUTH, THERE IS DOWNSIDE RISK.

11:44 >> HOW DIFFICULT WILL IT BE TO GET DOWN TO THEIR POLICY GOAL.

11:49 >> THE ECONOMY COULD STAY RESILIENT BUT INFLATION STAYS

11:50 MUCH STICKIER THAN EXPECTED.

11:52 >> THEY ARE IN A TRICKY SPOT.

11:54 >> I THINK THE FED WILL TRY TO BUY. TIME HERE JONATHAN:

11:59 THEY ARE SAYING IT'S BEST TO CANCEL THIS NEWS CONFERENCE.

12:02 IS THAT THE PROMO FOR THIS? LISA:

12:04 HE WILL TRY TO BE AS BORING AS POSSIBLE. STAY TUNED. TOM:

12:09 WE SHOULD HAVE PLAYED THIS EVERY DAY BECAUSE IT'S A POWER

12:13 GAME. EVERYBODY'S GOT AN OPINION.

12:15 JONATHAN: JUST KEEP THAT ON REPEAT.

12:18 HERE ARE THE SCORES GOING INTO THE FED DECISION 14 MINUTES

12:19 AWAY. EQUITIES ON THE S&P 500 ARE

12:27 NEGATIVE BY A QUARTER OF 1% AND DOWN 0.6% ON THE NASDAQ AND THE

12:32 RUSSELL IS ABSOLUTELY BATTERED, DOWN 7%.

12:35 GETTING TO THE BOND MARKET, WE'VE DONE SOME WORK SINCE THE

12:37 FED LAST MET.

12:43 WE WERE AT 4.60 AND WE WERE AT 4.20 THE LAST TIME THE FED MET.

12:48 ARE YOU UP LATE IN TOKYO? YOU ARE PROBABLY LOOKING AT

12:56 THIS ONE, DOLLAR YEN .57 WHICH IS JUST AS IMPORTANT FOR

12:58 THE JAPANESE CENTRAL BANK AND MINISTRY OF FINANCE AS THAT

13:02 MIGHT BE FOR THE TREASURY AND THE U.S. ECONOMY. TOM:

13:06 IT GOT TO LOOK AT OTHER THINGS BESIDES DOLLAR-YEN.

13:09 YOU WONDER IF THAT REACHES THROUGH A WEAKER YEN.

13:12 I LOOK AT THE YEN-YUAN.

13:19 I'M SORRY, IT'S A MASSIVE MOVE, 30% MOVE OFF THE YEN STRENGTH

13:21 OF LONG AGO. JONATHAN: KATHY JONES JOINS US TO DISCUSS

13:25 THIS. I KNOW WE'VE ONLY GOT A FEW

13:29 MINUTES SO I WANT TO COME TO YOU FIRST. YOUR CALL IS

13:32 DECEMBER ONE CUT THIS YEAR. WHAT CAN CHAIRMAN POWELL

13:37 POSSIBLY SAY WITH GIVEN WHAT YOU ALREADY THINK WILL HAPPEN

13:38 THIS YEAR?

13:44 >> I THINK THERE IS A LOT OF HAWKISH EXPECTATIONS.

13:49 CLIENTS HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER THEY DROP THE EASING

13:51 BIAS AND WHETHER OR NOT HE TALKS ABOUT HIKES AND OPENS UP

13:52 THE POSSIBILITY. I DON'T THINK YOU GET THOSE

13:55 TYPE OF HAWKISH SIGNALS. HE SOUNDS LIKE HE DID TWO WEEKS

13:59 AGO WHICH IS HAWKISH RELATIVE TO MARCH.

14:06 WHAT I WILL FOCUS ON IS DO THEY ADJUST THE FORWARD GUIDANCE

14:08 LANGUAGE AND ADJUST THE BALANCE OF RISK?

14:13 DOES HE CONTINUE TO SAY THAT THEY THINK THERE'LL BE A POLICY

14:16 RATE AND THE NEXT MOVE COULD BE A RATE CUT?

14:19 I THINK HE MAINTAINS THOSE THINGS BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I

14:24 THINK HE TALKS ABOUT DATA DEPENDENCE AND THEY ARE

14:27 PROBABLY COMFORTABLE WITH WHERE MARKET PRICING IS AT THE MOMENT.

14:31 TOM: WE ALMOST GOT TO 2.30% ON THE

14:32 10 YEAR. THAT'S A HIGH INFLATION-ADJUSTED YIELD.

14:38 WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR THE AMERICAN ECONOMY?

14:43 >> WHEN WE HAD REACHED THESE HIGHER LEVELS RECENTLY AND A

14:47 BIG TIGHTENING OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS, THE EXPECTATIONS

14:49 WAS YOU WOULD SEE A SLOW DOWN THE ECONOMY WHICH HAS NOT

14:53 HAPPENED. WE HAD A SLOW DOWN IN Q1, IF

14:56 YOU LOOK AT THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY, CONSUMER SPENDING,

15:01 RESIDENTIAL INVESTMENT GREW 3% ANNUALIZED.

15:05 THE CONSUMER DID 2.5% IN THE FIRST QUARTER.

15:10 THESE THINGS LOOK TIGHT HISTORICALLY BUT WE ARE NOT

15:12 SEEING VERY CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE THE FED IS

15:15 SUFFICIENTLY RESTRICTIVE IN ORDER TO GET INFLATION DOWN.

15:18 LISA: I LOVE HOW EVERYONE IS GOING TO

15:20 DISSECT EVERY PARAGRAPH. YOU ARE TRYING TO GET A SENSE

15:25 OF WHAT TO PAY ATTENTION TO. WHY DO YOU THINK THEY WILL NOT

15:30 TALK ABOUT ENDING QUANTITATIVE TIGHTENING?

15:35 SOME THINK HE WILL ADDRESS IT AND START TAPERING.

15:39 >> I THINK THERE IS A GOOD PROSPECT THEY DO THAT TODAY.

15:42 THEY'VE GIVEN A SINGLES THIS DECISION IS UPCOMING AND WE

15:45 LOOK AT THE MARCH MEETING IT SEEMS LIKE THEY WERE AGREED ON

15:46 THE KEY PARAMETERS. WHY NOT JUST GO AHEAD WITH THAT?

15:53 THERE IS NO URGENCY IN MAKING THE CHANGE AT THIS MEETING

15:55 BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN FOCUSED ON THINGS LIKE THE OVERNIGHT

16:02 FACILITY AND THAT'S WRITTEN IS -- AND THAT'S RISEN RECENTLY.

16:04 I WOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT EASING FINANCIAL CONDITIONS.

16:09 IF THE ONLY DECISION THAT COMES OUT OF THIS MEETING IS A

16:11 SLOWING IN THE PACE OF QT, I THINK THAT'S A PROBLEM FROM THE

16:15 FED'S PERSPECTIVE SO I SEE VERY LITTLE DOWNSIDE FOR DELAYING TO

16:19 JUNE OR AT A TIME WHERE THEY CAN PAIR IT WITH A MORE HAWKISH

16:20 LEANING DOT PLOT. THAT THINK IT'S EASY TO SEE

16:28 THAT THEY DO TALK ABOUT QT TODAY. JONATHAN:

16:30 GREAT TO HEAR FROM YOU TODAY. YOU SAID THAT REPEATEDLY OVER

16:33 THE LAST FEW WEEKS. LISA: IS THERE A CONCERN THAT THEY

16:39 SEND ONE MESSAGE MORE DOVISH THAN THEY WOULD LIKE BY SAYING

16:43 WE WANT TO END THE QUANTITATIVE TIGHTENING BUT WHY NOT GO AHEAD

16:46 OF THIS BECAUSE THEY CAN WALK AND CHEW GUM AT THE SAME TIME,

16:47 EVIDENTLY. JONATHAN: TOP MENTIONED THE STATEMENT.

16:57 THERE IS TWO LINES BOB MENTIONED , RECENT INDICATORS

16:58 SUGGEST ECONOMIC ACTIVITY HAS BEEN EXPANDING AT A SOLID BASE.

17:03 INFLATION HAS EASED OVER THE PAST YEAR BUT REMAINS ELEVATED.

17:06 WHEN WE OPEN UP THIS STATEMENT IN NINE MINUTES TIME, DO YOU

17:09 EXPECT THAT OPENING PARAGRAPH TO GET A HEAVY EDIT?

17:13 >> I THINK THERE WILL BE SOME EDIT TO IT.

17:18 YOU CAN STILL DESCRIBE THE ECONOMY EXPANDING AT A SOLID

17:23 PACE. SOLID MEANS IT'S EXPANDING AND

17:26 WE GOT 2.1% GROWTH IN THE FIRST QUARTER IN DOMESTIC DEMAND.

17:32 I THINK THAT CAN BE THE SAME STATEMENT.

17:37 AS FOR THE SIGNALING ON INFLATION AND WHERE WE GO FROM

17:41 HERE, I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE WILL PROBABLY SEE THE CHANGES

17:43 TO THE STATEMENT. IT'S HARD TO PARSE THROUGH THIS

17:48 AHEAD OF TIME BUT I WOULD GUESS IT GETS A HEAVY EDIT. TOM:

17:57 MARKETS ARE MOVING AND WE ARE ALMOST 2.30% REAL YIELD ON THE

17:59 10 YEAR WHICH CHANGES EVERYTHING FOR AMERICAN

18:00 BUSINESS. IS THE FED COGNIZANT OF THAT?

18:05 ARE THEY AWARE OF REAL YIELD RUNNING AWAY?

18:08 >> I'M SURE THEY ARE AND I'M SURE THEY WOULD HAVE THOUGHT

18:10 ELEVATED REAL YIELDS OF THE STAGE OF THE GAME PROBABLY

18:14 SLOWED THE ECONOMY MORE THAN HAS. BUSINESS INVESTMENTS ARE

18:19 STAYING PRETTY HEALTHY BUT WHEN I LOOK AND WHAT'S PUZZLING NOW

18:23 IS YOU LOOK AT THE COMMENTS FROM THE REGIONAL BANKS ABOUT

18:29 BUSINESS ACTIVITY AND CONSUMER SPENDING AND THEY ARE LITTLE

18:34 DOWNBEAT. THEY ARE NOT NEGATIVE BUT THEY

18:37 ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO SAY GROWTH EXPANDED SLIGHTLY OR

18:40 MODESTLY. RATHER THAN STRONGLY OR

18:42 MODERATELY. THEN WE GET THE AGGREGATE

18:45 NUMBERS AND THEY ARE PRETTY HEALTHY.

18:49 I THINK THE FED WOULD'VE EXPECTED BY NOW THAT HIGH YIELD

18:52 RATES WOULD'VE SLOWED THE ECONOMY MORE.

18:56 THERE ARE REASONS YOU CAN POINT TO LIKE FISCAL POLICY BEING

19:01 MORE EXPENSIVE REASON IT WILL TAKE LONGER BUT THE REAL RATE

19:04 STILL COUNTS AND WE'RE STARTING TO SEE THAT WITH CONSUMERS AND

19:09 CREDIT CARDS AND AUTO LOANS AND MORTGAGE RATES. LISA:

19:14 THIS IS A HIGHLY DATA DEPENDENT FED BUT IT'S TRICKY TO KNOW

19:17 WHICH DATA THEY ARE LOOKING AT AND HOW THEY WILL WEIGH IT.

19:21 WE GOT I.S. AMENDMENT FACTORING EARLIER AND

19:24 HE CAME IN LOWER THAN EXPECTED. PRICES PAID CAME IN AT THE

19:27 HOTTEST PACE GOING BACK MANY MONTHS.

19:31 WHERE DOES THE FED PLACE THE EMPHASIS IN TERMS OF ITS

19:32 MANDATE? DO WE GET A SENSE OF THAT TODAY

19:37 IN THE NEWS CONFERENCE?

19:44 IS THIS SOMETHING THEY WILL ADDRESS WITH KEEPING RATES

19:47 HIGHER FOR LONGER OR WILL THEY SAY WE CARE ABOUT THE ECONOMY

19:50 MOST OF ALL AND WE WANT TO KEEP IT GOING?

19:57 >> IS PRETTY OBVIOUS THEY ARE FOCUSING ON INFLATION BECAUSE

19:59 ECONOMIC GROWTH HAS BEEN PRETTY STURDY.

20:02 IF THEY WERE TO SHIP THAT EMPHASIS COME I THINK IT WOULD

20:05 BE DUE TO A DECLINE THE JOB MARKET.

20:08 IT WOULD BE A REAL PROBLEM IN THE JOB MARKET WHERE JOB GROWTH

20:14 REALLY DETAILED OF AND WE SAW THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE RISE.

20:32 THERE IS EVIDENCE OF THEM IGNORING GROWTH IN JOBS.

20:36 THE ECONOMY HAS STRUGGLED BUT IT'S WHEN JOB GROWTH

20:37 DETERIORATES THAT THEY HAD TO SWITCH THE FOCUS RATHER THAN

20:42 JUST FIGHTING INFLATION BACK TO THE DUAL MANDATE. LISA:

20:49 WHAT DO YOU THINK OF STAGFLATION LIKE TRENDS WITH

20:52 SLOWING GROWTH BUT STILL STICKY INFLATION THAT SEEMS TO BE

20:55 ACCELERATING?

20:56 >> I THINK WE ARE GETTING INTO A BROADER BASE TO SLOW DOWN.

21:00 YOU ARE SEEING SOME SLOWDOWN IN BUSINESSES AND HOUSEHOLDS.

21:04 I THINK THEY ARE STRUGGLING WITH A HIGHER PRICE OF

21:07 EVERYTHING AND THE HIGHER COST OF FUNDING THOSE HIGHER PRICES.

21:10 THAT WILL CONTINUE TO PUT DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON THE

21:13 ECONOMY. ULTIMATELY, THAT WILL START TO

21:15 BRING INFLATION DOWN AGAIN AND WE WILL RETURN TO DISINFLATION.

21:21 AS I HEAR YOU TALK, IT REMINDS ME THAT THE FED HAS TO BE

21:26 CAREFUL NOT TO BE TOO HAWKISH AND PUSH EVERYTHING TO ONE SIDE

21:27 OF THE BOAT. REAL YIELDS ARE HIGH AND I

21:33 DON'T BELIEVE THIS FED HAS GIVEN UP ON THE LONG AND

21:36 VARIABLE LAGS. I THINK THEY BEEN PUSHED OUT OF

21:38 IT AND I THINK THEY WILL HAVE TO COME IN BY YEAR END AND CUT

21:42 RATES A FEW TIMES TO STABILIZE THE ECONOMY.

21:45 BUT I THINK THEY HAVE TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO BE TOO HAWKISH.

21:49 MAYBE THAT'S WHERE YOU FIT QT BACK IN.

21:54 YOU OFFSET SOME OF THE HAWKISH RHETORIC WITH WE ARE GOING TO

21:56 START REDUCING TREASURY SALES. JONATHAN:

22:01 THREE-MONTH AVERAGE FOR PAYROLLS IS 276 AND THE

22:03 ESTIMATE FOR FRIDAY IS 240. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THOSE

22:07 NUMBERS?

22:13 >> IT'S A CORRELATION OF QUINCE RATE TO WAGE GAINS WHICH IS

22:17 NEARLY PERFECT HISTORICALLY. WAGES ARE COMING DOWN AND WE

22:24 KNOW THERE IS A NEW RECENTLY UNMEASURED SUPPLY OF WORKERS

22:26 COMING INTO THE MARKET THROUGH IMMIGRATION. THAT SHOULD HELP.

22:31 LISA: YOU ARE SAYING THAT'S NOISE AND

22:36 THE SIGNAL IS THE QUITS RATE? THAT GIVES YOU A SENSE OF A

22:39 SLOWDOWN THAT MAYBE THE DISTORTED NUMBERS MIGHT NOT GET?

22:43 >> I THINK YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT UNEMPLOYMENT WHICH IS A REAL

22:46 NUMBER AND DOES THAT GO ABOVE 4% AND YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT WAGE

22:48 GAINS. THAT'S THE OTHER REAL NUMBER.

22:51 I THINK THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYED WHETHER IT'S UP TO 75 OR 240,

22:55 THAT IS THE SPEEDING.

23:02 A LABOR MARKET QUESTION, WHERE SHOULD YOU PLACE THE EMPHASIS.

23:12 HOW MUCH WEIGHT SHOULD YOU PUT ON PAYROLLS ON FRIDAY RATHER

23:13 THAN THE JOLTS NUMBERS WE GOT EARLIER?

23:18 >> I WOULD AGREE THAT THE WAGE GAINS OR WHAT TO LOOK AT.

23:22 IF YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE LABOR MARKET INFLUENCE ON

23:25 INFLATION, IT HAS TO BE THE MECHANISM THROUGH WAGES.

23:30 WE ALSO NOTED THE JUMPS NUMBER -- THE JOLTS NUMBER IS -- WON'T

23:36 CORRELATE WITH LOWER WAGE GROWTH POSSIBLY CLOSER TO 3%

23:39 AND IT'S OUR EXPECTATION THAT WILL HAPPEN OVER TIME.

23:43 I THINK THE EMPHASIS HAS TO BE IN WAGE GAINS RATHER THAN JUST

23:46 A NOMINAL GROWTH IN JOBS. JONATHAN:

23:48 IT'S GOOD TO HEAR FROM YOU. WE ARE GOING INTO THAT FED

23:56 DECISION 2.5 MINUTES AWAY AND THEN A PRESS CONFERENCE WITH

23:57 JAY POWELL.

24:00 >> I WANT TO ASK HER WHAT SHE'S TRYING TO SIT -- TO TELL

24:03 CLIENTS TO DO? THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO GET IN

24:08 AND BY THE 2.29 PERCENT YOU REAL YIELD AND BY THE BACKUP IN

24:10 CREDIT SPREADS. WE ARE IN THE SOFT LANDING AND

24:13 YOU WILL GET CONFLICTING MESSAGES.

24:16 THE FED WILL BE CONFUSE, IT'S OK. JONATHAN:

24:19 DECLINES FEEL LIKE IT'S A SECOND CHANCE.

24:21 DO THEY FEEL THAT WAY?

24:27 >> ABSOLUTELY, I TALKED ABOUT A WASHOUT INTO THE FOMC MEETING.

24:29 WE ARE HAVING THAT'S A LET'S PUT SOME CASH TO WORK. JONATHAN:

24:36 DEALS ARE COMING IN A COUPLE OF BASIS POINTS IN THE DECISION IS

24:38 TWO MINUTES AWAY. WE WILL GO THROUGH THE S&P 500,

24:42 THE NASDAQ AND THE RUSSELL. THINK ABOUT HOW WE STARTED LAST

24:48 MONTH, WE CAME OUT OF MARCH AND SOME SAID IT'S TIME TO GET IT

24:53 TO THE ROTATION. YOU COULD LOOK TO SMALL CAPS IN

24:57 THE MONTH OF APRIL GOT ABSOLUTELY HAMMERED. LISA:

25:01 THESE ARE COMPANIES WHO ARE LEVERAGED TO THE RATE STAYING

25:03 HIGHER AND THEY GOT MORE IMPACT FROM THAT.

25:06 CAN YOU GET A ROTATION TRADE WITH RATES STAYING WHERE THEY

25:11 ARE?

25:12 SOME PEOPLE SAID GREAT, BY EVERYTHING BECAUSE THEIR HIGH

25:14 FOR THE RIGHT REASONS.

25:21 TOM: IT'S ABOUT GETTING OUT FRONT

25:24 WITH PRICE UP AND YIELD DOWN. THE REASON WE ARE HAVING THIS

25:30 DEBATE AS WE ARE BEGGING FOR A FED TO GET OUT FRONT.

25:36 THERE IS NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER THAT ANY MAJOR ESSENTIAL BANK

25:38 CAN DO THIS. THEY WILL WAIT AND WAIT AND

25:44 WAIT AND FINALLY, BOB WILL HAVE A PAY DAY. [LAUGHTER] JONATHAN:

25:50 THIS AFTERNOON ITS PRICE UP AND YIELD DOWN SO LET'S BRING IN

25:52 THE BOND MOVE. THE 10 YEAR IS DOWN ABOUT FOUR

25:56 BASIS POINTS ON THE SESSION.

26:04 THE TWO-YEAR IS 5.01% AND DOWN TO BASIS POINTS ON THE DAY.

26:12 IF WE SWITCH AND FINISH ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE, HELLO, DO-YEN.

26:21 DOLLAR-YEN AT THE MOMENT APPROACHING 158 WITH THE FED

26:22 DECISION KEY.

26:27 >> SHORT AND SIMPLE, A CHANGE IN THE STATEMENT BUT NO CHANGE

26:28 IN THE RATES. THE ECONOMIC OVERVIEW REMAINS

26:33 THE SAME WORD FOR WORD WITH SOLID GROWTH, STRONG JOB GAINS

26:35 AND INFLATION THAT HAS EASED OVER THE PAST YEAR BUT REMAINS

26:37 ELEVATED. A NEW LINE. IN RECENT MONTHS, THERE HAS

26:42 BEEN A LACK OF FURTHER PROGRESS TOWARDS THE COMMITTEE'S 2%

26:46 INFLATION OBJECTIVE. THE STATEMENT SAYS RISKS TO

26:52 ACHIEVING ITS GOALS HAVE MOVED TOWARDS BETTER BALANCE OVER THE

26:55 PAST YEAR, PUTTING THE ASSESSMENT IN THE PAST TENSE,

26:58 AND ADDING OVER THE PAST YEAR. IN ADDITION TO THE STATEMENT

27:03 WHICH SEEMED TO RATIFY THE MARKETS' VIEW THAT THERE WILL

27:06 NOT BE THREE RATE CUTS THIS YEAR, IF ANY AT ALL.

27:09 THE COMMITTEE DOES NOT BELIEVE IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO

27:13 REDUCE RATES UNTIL IT HAS GAINED FURTHER CONFIDENCE.

27:19 THE LONG-AWAITED BALANCE SHEET TAPER IS HERE.

27:24 THE TREASURY ROLLOFF CAP WILL DROP FROM $60 BILLION TO 25

27:28 BILLION A MONTH STARTING ON JUNE 1.

27:30 OFFICIALS HAD SUGGESTED IT WOULD BE LOWERED TO $30 BILLION.

27:35 NO CHANGE IN THE $35 BILLION CAP ON MORTGAGE BACKED

27:39 SECURITIES. HOWEVER, ANY MATURING

27:41 SECURITIES OVER THE CAP WILL BE REINVESTED IN TREASURIES RATHER

27:43 THAN MBS. THE VOTE UNANIMOUS. AND THAT IS IT. JONATHAN:

27:47 STAY CLOSE. LET'S RUN THROUGH THIS PRICE

27:49 ACTION. MIKE MCKEE GO TO THAT CONFERENCE IN A MOMENT.

27:58 ATTENTION TURNING TO THE BOND MARKET. AT THE MOMENT, THE RALLY

28:00 STICKS. YIELDS LOWER BY FOUR BASIS

28:03 POINTS ON THE 10 YEAR. JUST ABOUT HOLDING ON TO THAT

28:06 5% LEVEL. LOTS OF ATTENTION IN THE FX

28:11 MARKET WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE DOLLAR-YEN.

28:14 BACK DOWN TO 157.54. IT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE

28:20 DIFFICULT TO OUT-HAWK WHAT WAS ALREADY VERY HAWKISH PRICING IN

28:21 THE MARKET. THIS IS A FIRST ACT OF A

28:24 TWO-PART STORY. THE OTHER ACTORS IN ABOUT 20

28:28 MINUTES WHEN WE HEAR FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN.

28:31 I THINK WE CAN COMPARE AND CONTRAST BRIEFLY.

28:33 IT MIGHT SOUND A LITTLE BORING BUT EVERY WORD SEEMS TO MATTER.

28:39 THE LAST STATEMENT, THE FIRST PARAGRAPH -- RECENT INDICATORS

28:41 SUGGEST ECONOMIC ACTIVITY HAS BEEN EXPANDING AT A SOLID PACE.

28:45 JOB GAINS HAVE REMAINED STRONG AND THE AND UNEMPLOYMENT RATE

28:46 HAS WERE MAIN FLOW. INFLATION HAS EASED OVER THE

28:50 PAST YEAR BUT REMAINS ELEVATED. THE FIRST PARAGRAPH HAS CHANGED.

28:55 RECENT INDICATORS SUGGEST THAT ECONOMIC ACTIVITY HAS CONTINUED

28:57 TO EXPAND AT A SOLID PACE. JOB GAINS HAVE REMAINED STRONG

29:01 AND THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS REMAINED LOW.

29:03 INFLATION HAS EASED OVER THE PAST YEAR BUT REMAINS ELEVATED

29:05 IN RECENT MONTHS. THERE HAS BEEN A LACK OF

29:09 FURTHER PROGRESS TOWARDS THE COMMITTEE'S 2% INFLATION

29:10 OBJECTIVE. I WONDER HOW LONG THE CONVERSATION WAS IN THE FOMC TO

29:17 AGREE TO THAT LAST LINE OF THAT FIRST PARAGRAPH. LISA:

29:21 I WONDER BECAUSE THE DISCUSSION AMONG FED OFFICIALS WHO DID

29:25 SPEAK IN THE WEEK BEFORE THE QUIET PERIOD WAS MORE HAWKISH.

29:28 PEOPLE SEEMED GENUINELY CONCERNED.

29:30 I DON'T THINK THERE WAS DISAGREEMENT WITH THIS.

29:35 I JUST WONDER HOW MUCH CONVICTION CHAIR POWELL WILL

29:36 HAVE IN THIS NEWS CONFERENCE TO BUILD ON THAT AND TO SAY HOW

29:40 MUCH LESS CONVICTION THEY HAVE AND HOW MUCH MORE THEY WILL DO

29:41 TO OFFSET THE LACK OF PROGRESS. TOM:

29:44 I THINK THEY HAVE TO WAIT FOR MORE ECONOMIC DATA.

29:48 THE BOTTOM LINE, DO WE LINK TO FRIDAY'S JOBS DAY?

29:50 I AM SORRY, WE DO. THERE IS NO REAL INDICATION OF

29:53 THE LABOR MARKET CRACKING. THE JOLT SURVEY WAS A LITTLE

29:56 WEAK. BOB MICHELE MENTIONED THAT.

29:59 I THINK THEY HAVE TO WAIT. JONATHAN:

30:03 FANTASTIC LINEUP GOING INTO THE NEWS CONFERENCE.

30:04 BOB MICHELE STILL WITH US. JOINING US IS A GOOD FRIEND OF

30:10 THE PROGRAM, MOHAMED EL-ERIAN. WHAT JUMPS OUT? MOHAMED:

30:15 TWO THINGS. ONE IS THE CHARACTER IZATION OF

30:20 GROWTH IS STRONGER THAN I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED.

30:25 TWO, THE REDUCTION IN QE IS LARGER THAN I EXPECTED.

30:29 FINALLY, THAT THE ADDITIONAL SENTENCE THEY PUT IN ABOUT

30:34 INFLATION IS GOING TO PUT CHAIR POWELL IN A DIFFICULT SITUATION

30:35 AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL SAY, AGAIN, FINISH

30:37 THE SENTENCE. PROGRESS HAS NOT BEEN ACHIEVED,

30:41 WHY?

30:48 IS THERE SOMETHING CHAIRMAN TEMPORARY, STRUCTURAL?

30:50 IT HAS BEEN LEFT WIDE OPEN THE QUESTION OF WHY PROGRESS HAS

30:53 BEEN LESS THAN EXPECTED ON THE INFLATION FRONT. TOM:

30:57 IF I LOOK AT THIS PRESS CONFERENCE, THIS IS A CENTRAL

31:01 BANKER WITH AN ORIGINAL SCRIPT, NOT MUCH THEORY INVOLVED AT ALL.

31:04 CAN YOU GET OUT IN FRONT OF THE DEBATE OR IS THIS AN EX POST

31:07 DISCUSSION? MOHAMED: THIS IS AN EX POST DISCUSSION.

31:14 THIS IS A FED THAT HAD BEEN BURNED BY TRYING TO BE EX-ANTI

31:20 BACK IN 2021 HAS BEEN TOTALLY EXPOSED, TOTALLY DATA

31:22 DEPENDENT, TOTALLY REACTIVE. THAT IS A PROBLEM FOR THE

31:24 ECONOMY. THAT IS A REAL PROBLEM FOR THE

31:28 ECONOMY. HE WILL REMAIN EXPOSED. WE WILL HEAR DATA DEPENDENCY I

31:34 DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES DURING THE PRESS CONFERENCE.

31:36 LISA: WHICH RAISES THE QUESTION OF

31:39 WHICH DATA MATTERS MORE? WE ARE SEEING WEAKENING

31:43 ACTIVITY. ALSO, STICKIER INFLATION THAT

31:48 CAME IN HIGHER THAN EXPECTED WITH PRICES PAID.

31:51 HOW WILL THIS FED VIEW THE DATA THAT I DON'T WANT TO SAY

31:54 STAGFLATION BECAUSE I'VE SAID IT SO MANY TIMES AND PEOPLE

31:57 WILL BE MAKING FUN OF ME FOR THAT BUT I AM WONDERING IF THIS

32:00 IS NOT IDEAL FOR THEM AND IF THEY WILL RESPOND MORE TO THE

32:02 INFLATION SIDE OR THE ECONOMY SIDE. MOHAMED:

32:08 I CALL IT STAGFLATIONARY WINDS. LISA: THANK YOU. MOHAMED:

32:15 I CAN LIVE WITH STAGFLATION LITE.

32:19 THEY WILL NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BECAUSE IT PUTS THE QUESTION

32:23 FRONT AND CENTER WHICH IS WHAT IS THE INFLATION TARGET FOR AN

32:25 ECONOMY THAT IS GOING FUNDAMENTAL SUPPLY SHOCKS,

32:26 CHANGES? IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS STICKY

32:33 IN INFLATION, IT IS NOT PARTICULARLY RESPONSIVE TO

32:34 HIGHER INTEREST RATE FOR LONGER. IT REALLY ISN'T.

32:41 SO, IF THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THE SOFTER ECONOMY, THE END UP

32:46 HAVING TO DISCUSS AT LEAST INTERNALLY WHETHER 2% IS A

32:48 ROUND INFLATION TARGET. A PHRASE THAT JOHN DID NOT READ

32:53 OUT IN THE STATEMENT AS THEY ARE STRONGLY COMMITTED TO

32:56 RETURNING INFLATION TO ITS 2% TARGET. JONATHAN:

33:00 I WAS JUST ITCHING TO GET TO YOU TO GET YOUR REACTION.

33:02 BOB MICHELE WITH US AS WELL. TOM: I THINK MOHAMED EL-ERIAN

33:07 THROUGH YOU UNDER THE BUS. JONATHAN: HE DID.

33:13 TOM: YOU AT LEAST READ THE STATEMENT. LISA:

33:16 HOLD ON, THAT WAS IN IT BEFORE. IT DID NOT CHANGE, JON.

33:20 THAT IS THE REASON WHY. TOM: FACT, I HAVE NEVER READ A

33:22 STATEMENT. CONTINUE. JONATHAN: I BELIEVE YOU.

33:28 MOHAMED, WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ME, I DON'T KNOW.

33:31 BOB MICHELE, YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS ONE. BOB:

33:34 AS MICHAEL MCKEE WAS READING THROUGH THE COMMENTARY, THOUGHT

33:39 THIS IS REALLY GOOD FOR THE MARKET BECAUSE HERE'S A FED

33:41 THAT IS TELLING US LOOK AT THE LONGER TERM.

33:45 LOOK WHERE INFLATION WAS AND LOOK WHERE WE'VE GOTTEN THE TWO.

33:48 DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS.

33:50 WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS THERE. I THINK THAT IS THE RIGHT

33:52 MESSAGE.

33:53 I DON'T BELIEVE THE LAW OF LONG AND VARIABLE LAGS HAS BEEN

33:59 REPEALED. I THINK THEY HAVE BEEN DELAYED

34:01 BECAUSE OF ALL THE FISCAL STIMULUS BUT THEY ARE STILL

34:03 THERE. WE ARE SEEING SOME PRESSURE ON

34:05 THE ECONOMY. THE ONLY THING I WAS SURPRISED

34:10 ABOUT WAS THE CHARACTERIZED THE ECONOMY AS STILL SOLID. TOM:

34:17 I BROUGHT UP EARLY, I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU WERE IN 1990

34:21 FIVE, MAYBE AT THE WHITE HOUSE, MAYBE IMF BUT BOB MICHELE SAYS

34:25 WHISPERS OF 1995. THE STOCK MARKET WAS A MOONSHOT

34:31 OFF THE SUCCESS OF 1995. IS THAT WHAT WE ARE PREPARED

34:35 FOR HERE, THAT THEY MAY GET THIS RIGHT, WE MAY HAVE A

34:39 CONSTRUCTIVE 1995 AND UP WE GO? MOHAMED:

34:44 WHERE I AGREE WITH BOB WITHOUT ANY QUALIFICATIONS IS THAT THIS

34:48 PARTICULAR STATEMENT IS SOMETHING THAT THE MARKETS WILL

34:49 LIKE. IT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE MARKET

34:52 WANTED.

34:58 AS TO ARE WE GOING TO REPEAT 95 IN TERMS OF MARKET REACTION,

35:01 WHAT I AM WORRIED ABOUT, BECAUSE I TRULY BELIEVE THIS IS

35:06 NOT ABOUT LAGS AND THERE ARE STRUCTURAL ASPECTS THAT ARE

35:11 RUNNING THE INFLATION RATE HIGHER THAN IT HAS BEEN IN THE

35:15 PAST. I WORRY THAT THE FED WILL BE OVER TIGHT THIS YEAR.

35:18 I WORRY THAT THE FED WILL NOT END UP CUTTING BECAUSE THEY

35:23 WILL BE SO DATA DEPENDENT, SO REACTIVE THAT THEY WILL NOT

35:26 LOOK AT THE WEAKNESS THAT IS COMING IN FACT, IF YOU SIMPLY

35:31 READ THE EARNINGS REPORTS OF MCDONALD'S, STARBUCKS, PEPSICO,

35:35 NESTLE, THE LIST GOES ON, THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT LOW

35:38 INCOME CONSUMERS ARE STRUGGLING, THAT BALANCE SHEET

35:41 HAVE GONE FROM POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE SPEED THE PANDEMIC

35:44 SAVINGS ARE RUN DOWN. THE CREDIT CARD BALANCES ARE

35:47 HIGH. RELYING ENTIRELY ON THE LABOR

35:51 MARKET AND WAGE INCOME. IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG AND

35:55 THAT LABOR MARKET, WE ARE GOING TO SEE THIS ECONOMY SLOW MUCH

35:57 FASTER THAN ANYONE WOULD LIKE IT TO. JONATHAN:

36:00 TALK ABOUT A LOSS OF PRICING POWER OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS

36:04 OR SO. BOB MICHELE, YOU TALKED ABOUT

36:06 THE MID TO THOUSANDS. DO YOU SHARE THOSE CONCERNS

36:09 ABOUT ECONOMIC WEAKNESS STARTING TO BUILD, YET YOU ARE

36:13 STILL BULLISH AS YOU HAVE BEEN SINCE THE MID-2000.

36:16 CAN YOU ASK PLAIN WHITE? -- EXPLAIN WHY? BOB:

36:22 I THINK YOU HAVE TO WATCH HOW BUSINESSES ARE REACTING IN THIS

36:24 ENVIRONMENT AND THERE ARE SOME PRESSURES.

36:27 I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO WATCH IS THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE.

36:32 DOES THAT START TO GO ABOVE 4%.

36:38 AT 4.2%, IT WOULD GET THE FED'S ATTENTION AND THEY WOULD DO

36:39 SOMETHING AS LONG AS INFLATION IS REASONABLE.

36:42 WHAT THEY DID IN 1996 IS CUT RATES -- 1995 IS CUT RATES

36:45 THREE TIMES. THAT IS THE ONE SOFT LANDING I

36:49 HAVE LIVE THROUGH IN MY 40 PLUS YEARS IN THE MARKET.

36:53 IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS DOABLE AGAIN, BUT IT CANNOT BE A FED

36:55 THAT SITS ON THE SIDELINES THE ENTIRE YEAR AND LEAVES REAL

36:58 YIELDS WHERE THEY ARE. LISA: I HAVE TO GIVE YOU A VICTORY

37:02 LAP BECAUSE HE BASICALLY SAID THIS IS WHAT THEY MIGHT DO TO

37:05 GIVE A NOD TO THE DOVISH STANCE WHILE HAVING A MORE HAWKISH

37:09 STANCE OF THE ACTUAL STATEMENT, WHICH IS MAYBE WHAT THEY ARE

37:11 DOING. WHICH IS THE REASON WHY THE

37:12 MARKET MIGHT LIKE THIS. I AM WONDERING ABOUT THE POINT

37:16 OF STAGFLATION LITE OR THE WINDS OF STAGFLATION, THAT THEY

37:18 WILL NOT TALK ABOUT THIS. THEY WILL TALK ABOUT

37:22 STRENGTHENING THE ECONOMY SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT

37:24 MAYBE THEY ARE LOOKING AT A 3% TARGET RATHER THAN 2%. BOB:

37:29 POWELL IS PROBABLY LAUGHING EVERY TIME HE HEARS STAGFLATION

37:32 BECAUSE HE REMEMBERS, AND HE'S PROBABLY THINKING I AM.

37:39 2.8% CORE PCE, I WOULD TAKE THAT ANY SECOND.

37:45 IF YOU GO BACK TO 1995 TO 1998 WHICH TOM POINTS OUT WAS RATE

37:48 FOR MARKETS, INFLATION TRADED BETWEEN 2.5% AND 3%.

37:51 IT WAS A PRETTY VIBRANT ECONOMY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT MARKETS WILL

37:53 DO. I THINK THAT KIND OF ECONOMIC

37:56 SCENARIO IS REALISTIC. TOM: 1998 WAS A MOONSHOT.

38:01 THE DOW WENT FROM 4000 TO 10,000. I REMEMBER THAT. BOB:

38:06 SOMEBODY IS LOOKING TO GET OUT OF TROUBLE. TOM:

38:08 I AM LOOKING FOR THE FIRST-RATE. JONATHAN: TODAY IS THE DAY.

38:13 BOB HAS SOME BONDS TO TELL. DIANE JOINS US NOW.

38:17 MOHAMED WILL BE STICKING WITH US. YOU HAD 11, 12 MINUTES TO GO

38:21 INTO THIS. 18 MINUTES AWAY FROM THE PRESS

38:24 CONFERENCE WITH CHAIR POWELL. WHAT IS YOUR BIG QUESTION FROM

38:27 HIM AFTER READING THAT STATEMENT? DIANE:

38:31 ONE OF THE THINGS I AM SURPRISED THAT THEY COULD HAVE

38:33 GONE MORE HAWKISH ON AND I THINK THE NOT TO INFLATION

38:36 PICKING UP MORE RECENTLY WAS THE COMPROMISE IS THAT THEY

38:39 LEFT IT, THEY ARE WAITING TO DECIDE WHEN TO REDUCE RATES.

38:41 YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE THAT WITHIN THAT MEETING, GIVEN

38:45 WE'VE HEARD THAT THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT WE COULD SEE

38:49 RATE HIKES IF INFLATION PERSISTS FROM FED LEADERSHIP

38:53 THEMSELVES, THAT TO KEEP THAT LINE REDUCED RATES WHEN THEY

38:57 ARE GOING TO REDUCE RATES THAT THEY STILL THINK THE THRESHOLD

38:59 TO RAISE RATES IS MUCH HIGHER THAN THE THRESHOLD TO CUT RATES.

39:04 I THINK THAT IS WHERE THE BIAS IS WITHIN THE FED.

39:07 HOWEVER, WHAT I WILL BE LOOKING FOR IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE IS

39:10 WAS THERE DEBATE, AND IN THE MINUTES TO THIS MEETING, WAS

39:13 THERE DEBATE ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THEY MIGHT NEED TO

39:14 RAISE RATES? I THINK THE MOVE UP IN

39:21 INFLATION WE'VE SEEN HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT OVERSTATED.

39:25 WE KNOW THERE ARE SOME RESIDUAL SEASONALITY SUMMER BETWEEN THE

39:26 FIRST QUARTER AND SECOND-QUARTER REALITY.

39:29 THAT IS STILL TOO HOT. WHAT WE SAW WAS MUCH MORE

39:33 BROAD-BASED INFLATION IN THE SERVICE SECTOR.

39:36 THINGS LIKE HOME MAINTENANCE, CAR MAINTENANCE.

39:40 IT WAS NOT INSURANCE AS MUCH OF THIS MONTH, BUT THOSE ARE

39:45 THINGS THAT ARE THE THINGS THAT MOHAMED TALKS ABOUT LESS

39:46 RETRACTABLE AND MORE SYSTEMIC. THERE WAS SERVICE SECTOR

39:50 INFLATION IN THE EMPLOYMENT COST INDEX AS WELL, NOT IN THE

39:53 LOWEST WAGE JOBS. PARTICULARLY IN FOOD SERVICES

39:57 AND ACCOMMODATION WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN DECELERATING QUITE

40:01 RAPIDLY AND ARE NOW TRAILING OVERALL INFLATION NUMBERS.

40:04 BUT IN THE OVERALL SERVICES SECTOR, WHERE WE DO HAVE SOME

40:09 LABOR SHORTAGES STILL PRETTY ACUTE, THERE IS WAGE PRESSURES

40:12 THERE AND THAT IS WHAT THE FED WILL BE FOCUSED ON. TOM:

40:17 THE DIANE SWONK CHARM IS IF YOU ARE NOT LIVING WITHIN THREE ZIP

40:21 CODES OF SOME FANCY UNIVERSITY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.

40:24 IF YOU DRIVE SEVEN HOURS SOUTH OF CHICAGO, WHAT IS IT LIKE

40:29 RIGHT NOW? I SEE WITH ALL THE MAIL I GET,

40:32 WHAT YOU GET OUT OF LINKEDIN, THERE'S A MASSIVE DIVIDE

40:34 BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL PEOPLE AND THE REST OF AMERICA.

40:37 WHAT IS IT LIKE SOUTH OF ILLINOIS? DIANE:

40:40 IT IS REALLY INTERESTING. THEY HAVE JUST DONE A STUDY ON

40:45 THIS IN TERMS OF HOW PEOPLE VIEW THE INFLATION PROBLEM.

40:48 WEALTHY HOUSEHOLDS, THOSE IN THE URBAN AREAS, THEY TEND TO

40:51 VIEW THE ENTIRE INFLATION PROBLEM AS COMPLETELY THE FAULT

40:54 OF THE FED. THOSE WHO ARE LESS WEALTHY SEE

40:57 THIS AS PRICE GOUGING. THEY SEE THIS AS AN INEQUALITY

40:59 ISSUE. AND WE STILL HAVE GROSS INEQUALITIES, EVEN THOUGH WE

41:07 HAVE THIS MASSIVE LEVELING OUT OF WAGES EVEN FOR LOW-WAGE

41:10 WORKERS AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE, THEY MOVE FROM THE SHADOWS OF

41:13 THE ECONOMY INTO THE SUN ONLY TO BE BURNED BY INFLATION AND

41:16 THAT INEQUALITY, EVEN THOUGH WEALTH PICKED UP, WE SAW ACROSS

41:22 INCOME STRATA, THAT WAS ENOUGH BECAUSE INEQUALITY CONTINUED TO

41:27 WORSEN. I THINK THAT IS WHAT YOU SEE WHEN YOU'RE DEALING

41:29 WITH THIS KIND OF INFLATION EVEN THOUGH IT IS A LOW GRADE.

41:33 I WOULD NOT COMPARE IT TO 1995. THE FED WAS WRONG IN 1994.

41:38 CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN HAD A CHECKLIST, I REMEMBER IT.

41:42 HE THOUGHT HE COULD PREEMPT INFLATION AND HE WAS WRONG I

41:43 NEARLY DERAILED THE ECONOMY. THAT IS NOT COMING OFF AN

41:48 INFLATIONARY KIND OF SITUATION THAT WE HAVE TODAY.

41:49 IT IS NOT COMPARABLE. LISA:

41:55 THIS RAISES A QUESTION -- MOHAMED I WOULD LOVE TO GET

41:57 YOUR ANSWER BECAUSE YOU LIVE WITHIN A COUPLE OF ZIP CODES OF

42:01 A FANCY U.K. COLLEGE. WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THE

42:06 MESSAGING OF CHAIR POWELL IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE.

42:09 DO YOU THINK HE NEEDS TO BE HAWKISH, HE NEEDS TO KEEP THE

42:11 MARKET UNDER PRESSURE IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM ON THIS GOAL OF AT

42:15 LEAST HAVING TO CUT RATES THIS YEAR WHICH YOU THINK IS

42:21 NECESSARY, AS THEY WANT TO DO BUT UNDER THE AUSPICES OF DATA

42:23 DEPENDENCY, IT IS DIFFICULT WITHOUT SOME CRACKING? MOHAMED:

42:27 THE MOST DIFFICULT THING IS TO STICK TO WHAT HAPPENED IN THE

42:30 MEETINGS AND NOT END UP LIKE IN THE PAST WHERE HIS MESSAGING IS

42:33 DIFFERENT FROM THE MESSAGING OF THE MINUTES WE WILL GET IN A

42:38 FEW WEEKS.

42:39 BECAUSE OF THAT HAPPENS, THAT WILL CAUSE TOO MUCH VOLATILITY

42:42 YET AGAIN. CONFUSION AND IT IS GOING TO

42:44 ERODE FORWARD POLICY GUIDANCE. IF WHAT HE SAYS IS IN FACT WHAT

42:51 WAS SAID IN THE MEETING AND IS CONFIRMED BY THE MINUTES, THEN

42:54 WHAT HE SHOULD DO IS STICK TO WHERE HE IS RIGHT NOW WHICH IS

43:01 NOT VALIDATE THE AMOUNT OF THE HAWKISH PIVOT, NOT GO ALL THE

43:04 WAY, BUT GO SOME OF THE WAY. MY CONCERN IS ULTIMATELY HE MAY

43:08 END UP MORE HAWKISH THAN HE NEEDS TO BE FOR THE WELL-BEING

43:12 OF THE ECONOMY BUT THAT IS MORE FOR THE NEXT MEETING THAN THIS

43:16 MEETING. LISA: DIANE, DO YOU THINK HE'S GOING

43:18 TO COME OUT MORE HAWKISH THAN HE NEEDS TO BE AS WELL? DIANE:

43:22 I THINK THAT IS THE RISK. IT IS BECAUSE THE RISK HAS BEEN

43:25 ON THE OTHER SIDE. IT IS VERY HARD, THESE PRESS

43:29 CONFERENCES HAVING THEM EVERY SINGLE MEETING.

43:31 THERE'S A DOWNSIDE TO TRANSPARENCY.

43:35 WE SEE HOW THE SAUSAGE IS BEING MADE BUT YOU SEE THE INDIVIDUAL

43:38 PERSONALITY OF THE CHAIRMAN HIMSELF AND THEIR OWN VIEWS AND

43:40 HOW THAT GETS TRANSLATED AND GETS MUDDLED IN TERMS OF WHAT

43:41 THE OVERALL MESSAGING IS. IT IS NOT THAT HE'S A BAD

43:45 COMMUNICATOR, BUT THIS IS REALLY HARD.

43:49 I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I GET FRUSTRATED WITH IS HOW

43:55 LITTLE UNCERTAINTY THE LEADERSHIP OF THE FEDERAL

43:56 RESERVE HAVE SHOWN ABOUT THE ECONOMY.

43:59 I THINK CHAIR POWELL HAS BEEN MORE HUMBLE IN THAT REGARD

44:03 BECAUSE HE SENT TO EAT CROW IN PUBLIC ON THIS ISSUE BUT THE

44:05 HUMILITY AND UNCERTAINTY WE FACE IS VERY HIGH.

44:09 THAT IS THE SORT OF -- COMING OUT AND MAKING STATEMENTS

44:13 FOLLOWING THE MEETING TO COUNTER OR TO CHANGE THE

44:15 MESSAGE OR REFLECT THE MESSAGE THAT WAS IN THE MEETING, I

44:21 THINK IT IS NOT PRODUCTIVE, BUT THE CERTAINTY WITH WHICH SOME

44:23 OF THESE COMMENTS ARE MADE IS REALLY NOT HELPFUL EITHER

44:25 BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY.

44:30 LET'S FACE IT, WE ARE AT 2% ON THE FED'S RUN RATE FOR THREE

44:34 AND SIX MONTHS ON CORE AND OVERALL INFLATION COMING DOWN.

44:44 PEOPLE WERE ARGUING THEY SHOULD BE CUTTING LIKE CRAZY AND THE

44:46 FED SAID LET'S BE CONSCIOUS HERE.

44:51 THEY SAID NO, I WILL NOT BE HEAD FAKE BY THIS AGAIN AND

44:52 THEY HELD BACK. THAT WAS GOOD TO HOLD BACK

44:56 BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN AN ACCELERATION.

44:59 IT IS PROBABLY OVERSTATED BUT WE HAVE TO SEE WHERE WE ARE

45:02 GOING AND THERE IS TIME WITH THE LEGS THAT ARE ALREADY STILL

45:05 IN THE MARKET WITH REGARD TO FED TIGHTENING. JONATHAN:

45:09 DIANE SWONK, THANK YOU. TALK ABOUT HUMILITY,

45:15 PERFORMANCE AGO, WE HAD PEOPLE ON THIS PROGRAM TALK ABOUT CUTS

45:17 IN MARCH. THIS WAS A FED MEANT TO ALREADY

45:19 BE CUTTING. HIM ENTERTAINING THE POTENTIAL

45:21 OF HIKING INTEREST RATES.

45:24 MICHAEL GAPEN, I KEEP HEARING THAT CHAIRMAN POWELL WILL BE

45:30 HAWKISH. CAN YOU DEFINE WHAT HAWKISH

45:33 WILL SOUND LIKE GIVEN YOU, LIKE OTHERS, THINK THE FIRST CUT

45:35 COMES IN DECEMBER WHICH IS NOT ANYTIME SOON. MICHAEL:

45:41 I THINK HAWKISH TODAY SIMPLY IS A WAIT-AND-SEE MESSAGE.

45:46 WE NEED TO GIVE POLICY MORE TIME TO WORK.

45:50 THAT IS REALLY ABOUT AS FAR AS I THINK THEY GO TODAY.

45:55 I THINK HE WILL REPEAT THEIR VIEW THAT THE SUPPLY SIDE IS

45:59 HELPING BRING INFLATION DOWN SO INFLATION IS STILL IN A

46:02 DOWNWARD TREND. PROGRESS HAS NOT BEEN WHERE WE

46:05 WANTED IT TO BE BUT WE THINK OUR POLICY STANCE IS TIGHT SO

46:07 THE ANSWER IS LET THAT TIE POLICY WORK FOR LONGER.

46:11 I THINK THAT IS ABOUT AS FAR AS THEY ARE READY TO GO TODAY.

46:15 THAT IS HAWKISH IN MAY. WE WILL SEE WHAT HAWKISH MIGHT

46:18 LOOK LIKE IN JUNE. TOM: ARE WE BACK TO NORMAL, ARE WE

46:21 BEYOND THE PANDEMIC? WE TALKING ABOUT FIXED INCOME

46:27 DYNAMICS THAT MAKES SENSE NOW POST-PANDEMIC OR ARE WE STILL

46:30 LIVING THE DEBRIS OF WHAT WE HAD FOR THREE OR FOUR YEARS?

46:33 MICHAEL: WE ARE STILL IN THE SHADOW OF

46:34 COVID. BOB: THERE IS STILL STIMULUS THAT IS

46:37 BEING DISTRIBUTED. WHEN WE TALK TO OUR RECENT --

46:42 MUNICIPAL RESEARCH TEAM, THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT STATE AND

46:46 LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, ACCESSING IT, GOING OUT AND MAKING SOME

46:49 HIRING AND SPENDING IT. THEY TALK ABOUT ACCESSING SOME

46:54 OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE ACT, THE CHIPS ACT.

46:56 THAT MONEY IS STILL THERE. YOU LOOK AT CONSUMER BALANCE

47:02 SHEETS, DEPOSIT BALANCES ON AVERAGE ARE STILL A LITTLE BIT

47:04 ABOVE WHERE THEY WERE PRE-COVID. IT IS STILL SLOSHING AROUND A

47:08 LITTLE BIT BUT IT IS COMING DOWN PRETTY QUICKLY. LISA:

47:11 IT RAISES THE QUESTION ABOUT LONG INVARIABLE LAGS.

47:15 MICHAEL GAPEN, I'M CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR VIEW ABOUT WHETHER

47:17 THIS IS A FED THAT HAS ABANDONED THAT WERE NOT,

47:20 CONSIDERING THE FACT SO MANY PEOPLE ARE SAYING THIS IS AN

47:22 ECONOMY THAT CAN LIVE WITH HIGHER RATES.

47:25 THE EVIDENCE IS THE STRENGTH IN DEBT MARKETS IN GENERAL.

47:29 DO YOU THINK THEY WILL GO THERE AND IT MATTERS IN TERMS OF

47:32 THEIR FAITH IN LONG INVARIABLE LAGS? MICHAEL:

47:35 I DON'T THINK THEY WILL GO THERE AND SAY GREAT DETAIL

47:36 TODAY. I AGREE WITH SOME OF THE

47:42 COMMENTS THAT BOB MADE EARLIER ABOUT LONG INVARIABLE LAGS

47:43 STILL BEING IN THE PIPELINE. I THINK SOME PARTS OF THE

47:47 ECONOMY REACTED VERY QUICKLY TO HIGHER RATES.

47:49 OTHERS MAY STILL BE IN FRONT OF US. THINGS LIKE FIXED RATE

47:56 MORTGAGES, THE EFFECTIVE MORTGAGE RATE RISING VERY

47:58 LITTLE, CORPORATE MEETING TO REFINANCE AT SOME POINT.

48:02 I THINK YOU CAN MAKE A CASE THAT SOME OF THE MONETARY

48:05 TIGHTENING IS STILL IN THE PIPELINE, IT HAS JUST BEEN

48:08 ELONGATED. I DOUBT THE CHAIR WILL GET INTO

48:10 THAT TODAY, ALTHOUGH I THINK IT IS A VERY REASONABLE QUESTION

48:14 TO ASK HIM IN LIGHT OF INFLATION IN RECENT MONTHS.

48:17 AS YOUR POLICY STANCE IS AS TIGHT AS YOU THINK IT IS.

48:22 IF NOT, WHAT WILL YOU DO ABOUT IT? JONATHAN:

48:24 ONE FINAL QUESTION FOR ME. ETHIC WE SPENT THE LAST MONTH

48:28 OR SO TRYING TO WORK OUT HOW THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL

48:29 RESPOND EVERY SINGLE DAY. CAN YOU ENTERTAIN US A LITTLE

48:34 BIT, JUST INDULGE ME, HOW REACTIVE WILL THEY BE TO

48:35 DOWNSIDE SURPRISES? HOW QUICKLY WILL THIS

48:39 CONVERSATION CHANGE? WILL WE BE SITTING HERE TALKING

48:43 ABOUT CUTS ALL OVER AGAIN? MICHAEL:

48:47 I THINK YOU PROBABLY NEED A NUMBER UNDER 150 TO GET THAT

48:51 DISCUSSION ON THE TABLE. IF CONSENSUS IS RIGHT AND THAT

48:58 240 TO 275 RANGE, YOU HAVE TO MAJORLY UNDER SHOOT THAT.

49:01 YOU NEED SOMETHING THAT CHANGES THE OVERALL NARRATIVE.

49:03 PEOPLE LIKE ME WOULD HAVE TO SAY IT LOOKS LIKE THE CATCHUP

49:08 EFFECT IS OVER, SO THE LABOR MARKET LOOKS FUNDAMENTALLY

49:09 DIFFERENT. IT IS A PRETTY BIG HURDLE IN MY

49:11 VIEW. JONATHAN: MIKE CAPON, THANK YOU, SIR.

49:19 MICHAEL GAPEN, BASE CASE, DECEMBER WILL BE THE FIRST CUT.

49:24 YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW SENSITIVE THIS FEDERAL RESERVE IS FROM

49:26 DATA POINT TO DATA POINT. DO YOU THINK THIS WOULD OUR

49:30 STATION HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CHANGE QUITE FAST AND THE OTHER

49:31 DIRECTION? MOHAMED: I DO BECAUSE THEY ARE SO

49:34 REACTIVE. THE ONE THING WE DIDN'T TALK

49:41 ABOUT AND TOM TALKED ABOUT THE 1990'S IS THE ECONOMY IS

49:43 CHANGING BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY.

49:47 THE 1990'S WAS ABOUT THE REGULATION, LIBERALIZATION, AND

49:48 FISCAL PRUDENCE. TODAY, IT IS ABOUT

49:53 REREGULATION, HEAVIER GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION, AND

49:54 FISCAL RESPONSIVELY. THE 1990'S WAS ABOUT

49:58 GLOBALIZATION. NOW, IT IS ABOUT FRAGMENTATION.

50:03 THIS IS A SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT OPERATING ENVIRONMENT.

50:09 SO, THE RISK IS THAT YOU MISS ALL THOSE SIGNALS AND YOU END

50:14 UP REACTING TOO SLOWLY TO WHAT'S COMING UP.

50:19 I SMILED WHEN I HEARD BOB SAY IT IS VERY EASY IF WE GET ALL

50:23 THESE BAD NUMBERS, THE FED CAN SIMPLY REACT.

50:26 BUT BY THE TIME IT REACTS, THE HARM HAS BEEN MADE.

50:28 IT IS A LITTLE BIT LIKE BEING ON A PLANE.

50:32 WHEN THE PILOT IS REACTING TO PAST TURBULENCE.

50:35 HE IS JUST GOING TO ADD TO THE TURBULENCE IN THE SHORT-TERM.

50:38 THERE IS AN ISSUE ABOUT HAVING TO STEP BACK AND ASK THE

50:42 QUESTION, WHAT THE ECONOMY IS OPERATING IN AND THE BALANCE OF

50:46 RISK AND THE ECONOMY. LISA: BOB, DO YOU AGREE THAT MAYBE

50:50 THEY SHOULD MOVE QUICKLY IF THEY START TO SEE WEAKNESS?

50:54 UNCLEAR WHAT THEY WILL DO. BOB: THAT IS ALREADY THERE SOME OF

50:57 THE WEAKNESS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT CONSUMER

51:01 SENTIMENT, CONSUMERS ARE FRUSTRATED.

51:04 THEY ARE HAVING TO MAKE CHOICES ON WHERE THERE DOLLAR GOES.

51:07 THEY ARE GOING DOWN BRAND. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE HOUSING

51:11 MARKET, HOME AFFORDABILITY IS A TRAIN WRECK.

51:14 YOU LOOK AT EXISTING HOME SALES, THEY ARE LOCATED THE

51:16 CONSUMERS FEELING THE PRESSURE. YOU LOOK AT MIDDLE-MARKET

51:20 CORPORATE AMERICA, THEIR COST OF FUNDING WENT FROM 6% TO

51:23 SOMEWHERE AROUND 10% TO 12%. THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE PAYING

51:28 AND THEY ARE FEELING THE PRESSURE OF HIGHER INPUT COSTS.

51:31 THAT IS REALLY STRANGLING THEIR MARGINS.

51:33 SO, A LOT OF IT IS THERE. A LOT OF IT IS SLOWING DOWN.

51:39 MAYBE THAT IS SOME OF WHAT WE SAW IN FIRST QUARTER GDP, I

51:40 DON'T KNOW. BUT, WE ARE GOING TO SEE MORE

51:43 OF IT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE UNEMPLOYMENT

51:45 NUMBER. FOR ME, IF THAT GOES ABOVE 4%,

51:50 THAT IS REALLY GOING TO GET THE FED'S ATTENTION. TOM:

51:54 I THINK IT IS TIMELY WITH COLLEGE PROTESTS ACROSS

51:56 AMERICA, I AM NOT SURE WHAT'S GOING ON AT CAMBRIDGE BUT I

52:02 WANT TO BE CLEAR HERE ON JOE STIGLITZ' BOOK, ECONOMICS AND

52:05 THE GOOD SOCIETY. IS CHAIRMAN POWELL TODAY GOING

52:10 TO SPEAK TO A FRACTURED AMERICA, TO THE POLARITIES OF

52:13 AMERICA OR IS THIS BASICALLY TO THE FINANCIAL AUDIENCE? MOHAMED:

52:19 I THINK HE'S GOING TO SPEAK TO EVERYBODY IN THE BEGINNING WHEN

52:22 HE SAYS THAT THE FED IS COMMITTED TO THE WELL-BEING OF

52:24 AMERICANS, ALL AMERICANS, ETC. HE WILL STAY A MILE AWAY FROM

52:28 WHAT'S GOING ON ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES. LISA:

52:30 HE MIGHT NOT STAY A MILE AWAY FROM THE FACT THEY ARE NOT

52:32 NECESSARILY GOING TO BE FOCUSED ON THE ELECTION.

52:35 BOB, YOU HAVE A SENSE THAT THEY DO NOT CUT RATES IN JULY, THEY

52:38 ONLY CAN GO IN DECEMBER BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL ELECTION

52:42 QUESTIONS AND POLITICAL INTERFERENCE? BOB:

52:45 I'VE HAD ENOUGH CONVERSATIONS WITH FORMER FED OFFICIALS THAT

52:49 IF THEY NEED TO GO IN SEPTEMBER, THEY WILL GO IN

52:50 SEPTEMBER. JONATHAN: WHAT DOES NEED TO GO LOOK LIKE?

52:53 BOB: FOR US, IT IS RISING UNEMPLOYMENT.

52:59 IT IS SOMETHING ABOUT 4.2%. JONATHAN: THAT'S THE THRESHOLD?

53:04 MOHAMED, WOULD YOU AGREE? MOHAMED: I WOULD. JONATHAN:

53:10 GET INTO THE 4'S, THEY START TO CUT. BOB:

53:14 IT DEPENDS WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON BECAUSE MOHAMED IS R IGHT.

53:20 ONCE THIS STARTS, IT TENDS TO ESCALATE VERY QUICKLY.

53:23 IF YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE THAT FIRST CUT AFTER WAITING SO

53:25 LONG, WHY NOT DO 50? LISA: MOHAMED, I AM CURIOUS WHAT YOUR

53:32 QUESTION WOULD BE TO FED CHAIR JAY POWELL WHEN A LOT OF PEOPLE

53:34 ARE ASKING WHAT WOULD IT TAKE FOR YOU TO HIKE RATES? MOHAMED:

53:38 THE ONE THING WE HAVE NOT TALKED ABOUT AT ALL IS WHAT IS

53:39 THE TERMINAL RATE? WHERE DOES HE THINK WE END UP?

53:43 WE TALK ABOUT THE JOURNEY, BUT WILL SOMEONE TELL US WHERE THE

53:47 DESTINATION IS? JONATHAN: YOU TELL US WHAT YOU THINK THE

53:50 DESTINATION IS. MOHAMED: I THINK IT IS SIGNIFICANTLY

53:53 HIGHER THAN WITH THE FED IS SAYING RIGHT NOW. JONATHAN:

53:57 2.5%? MOHAMED: I THINK WE ARE ABOVE 3%, YEAH.

54:02 JONATHAN: CLOSER TO 4%? MOHAMED: YES. TOM:

54:09 BOB, HOW DO YOU DOVETAIL WITH THE POTENTIAL GDP UNDER 2%?

54:14 HOW DO WE HAVE A RUN RATE ABOVE 3% AS JP MORGAN IS PUBLISHING

54:17 OUT?

54:23 BOB: EVERYTHING GOES IN STAGES. A HIGH REAL FED FUNDS RATE WILL

54:27 SLOW THINGS DOWN. THE FED WILL PULL BACK THE FED

54:29 FUNDS RATE. I AGREE WITH MOHAMED, MAYBE

54:35 SOMETHING IN THE 3.5% TO 4% BRACKET. 2.6% IS A FANTASY.

54:40 THAT WILL CREATE ENOUGH STIMULUS THAT THINGS WILL PICK

54:41 UP AGAIN. IT WILL COME IN CYCLES AGAIN,

54:45 AS IT ALWAYS DONE. JONATHAN: IF IT IS A FANTASY, WHY ARE

54:49 THEY ADJUSTING THAT? DO YOU THINK THAT IS SOMETHING

54:51 THEY DON'T WANT TO ENGAGE WITH AT THE MOMENT?

54:54 IS THAT WHAT THAT'S ABOUT? BOB: MY QUESTION THAT MIKE MCKEE

55:01 SHOULD BE ASKING IS HAVE THE DOTS OUTLIVED THEIR USEFULNESS?

55:03 I BELIEVE THEY HAVE. I THINK THEY SHOULD DO AWAY

55:05 WITH IT. I THINK IN 2012 WHEN THEY WERE

55:11 INCOMPLETELY UNCHARTED TERRITORY, THEY HELPED FOR A

55:12 VERY BRIEF PERIOD OF TIME. JONATHAN:

55:17 BOB MICHELE, MOHAMED EL-ERIAN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING.

55:22 GOING INTO THE PRESS CONFERENCE WITH CHAIRMAN POWELL.

55:27 THE S&P 500 TURNING POSITIVE, HIGHER BY 0.2%.

55:30 THE NASDAQ JUST ABOUT UNCHANGED. WE WANT TO STAY ON THE BOND

55:34 MARKET AND TALK ABOUT THE TWO-YEAR. THE REPRICING HERE.

55:39 FIRST MEETING OF THE YEAR, SOMETHING LIKE 4.20.

55:42 THIS MEETING, 5%. ADDED 40 BASIS POINTS BETWEEN

55:45 MEETINGS EACH AND EVERY TIME. LISA: FOR GOOD REASON.

55:49 IT IS NOT BECAUSE OF FED RHETORIC.

55:52 IT IS THE ECONOMIC DATA THAT IS HOTTER THAN EXPECTED.

55:55 THE FED PERSISTENT UNDER THE HOOD.

55:58 I'LL BE AT, THE CRACK'S YOUR TALK ABOUT.

56:00 ARE THEY COMFORTABLE WITH THIS, ARE THEY HAPPY WITH THIS?

56:03 WHAT DO THEY SEE OVER THE LONGER-TERM?

56:06 HOW DO THEY SEE THE FEDERAL DEFICIT WEIGHING IN ON ALL THIS?

56:08 THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS. IS HE GOING TO TRY TO BE AS

56:11 BORING AS POSSIBLE? JONATHAN: DON'T SPEAK.

56:16 AN INTERESTING NEWS CONFERENCE. LISA:

56:18 IT WILL BE DOWNSIDE RISK FROM HERE. JONATHAN:

56:21 IN JUST A MOMENT, CHAIRMAN POWELL WILL WALK THROUGH THAT

56:25 DOOR AND HOPEFULLY HE STANDS AT THE PODIUM AND ACTUALLY SAYS

56:26 SOMETHING. THE LAST LINE OF THE STATEMENT,

56:30 THERE HAS BEEN A LACK OF FURTHER PROGRESS FROM THE

56:34 COMMITTEE'S 2% INFLATION OBJECTIVE.

56:35 WHAT DOES THAT SOUND LIKE? LISA: AT THIS POINT, HOW MUCH IS THAT

56:39 A STRUCTURAL CHANGE? WHY IS THIS THE CASE?

56:43 IS HE GOING TO SAY ESSENTIALLY IT WILL TAKE A LOT LONGER,

56:46 THOSE LONG AND VARIABLE LAGS? JONATHAN:

56:49 HERE'S THE CHAIRMAN OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE.

56:51 THE NEWS CONFERENCE WITH CHAIRMAN POWELL.

56:58 CHAIRMAN POWELL: GOOD AFTERNOON. MY COLLEAGUES AND I REMAINED

57:05 SQUARELY FOCUSED ON OUR DUAL MANDATE TO PROMOTE MAXIMUM

57:07 EMPLOYMENT AND STABLE PRICES FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

57:12 THE ECONOMY HAS MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS TOWARDS

57:13 OUR DUAL MANDATE OBJECTIVES. INFLATION HAS EASED

57:18 SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE PAST YEAR, WHILE THE LABOR MARKET

57:19 HAS REMAINED STRONG. THAT IS VERY GOOD NEWS.

57:23 BUT INFLATION IS STILL TOO HIGH. FURTHER PROGRESS IN BRINGING IT

57:28 DOWN IS NOT ASSURED AND A PATH FORWARD IS UNCERTAIN.

57:33 WE ARE FULLY COMMITTED TO RETURNING INFLATION TO OUR 2%

57:37 GOAL. RESTORING PRICE STABILITY IS

57:39 ESSENTIAL TO ACHIEVE A SUSTAINABLY STRONG LABOR MARKET

57:40 THAT BENEFITS ALL. TODAY, THE FOMC DECIDED TO

57:48 LEAVE OUR POLICY INTEREST RATE UNCHANGED AND TO CONTINUE TO

57:50 REDUCE OUR SECURITIES HOLDINGS, THOUGH AT A SLOWER PACE.

57:56 OUR RESTRICTIVE STANCE OF MONETARY POLICY HAS BEEN

57:57 PUTTING DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND

58:02 INFLATION, AND THE RISKS TO ACHIEVING OUR EMPLOYMENT AND

58:04 ACHIEVEMENT GOALS HAVE GOING TOWARDS A BETTER BALANCE OVER

58:05 THE PAST YEAR. HOWEVER, IN RECENT MONTHS COME

58:10 INFLATION HAS SHOWN A LACK OF FURTHER PROGRESS TOWARDS OUR 2%

58:15 OBJECTIVE AND WE REMAIN HIGHLY ATTENTIVE TO INFLATION RISKS.

58:19 I WILL HAVE MORE TO SAY ABOUT MONETARY POLICY AFTER BRIEFLY

58:20 REVIEWING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS. RECENT INDICATORS SUGGEST THAT

58:26 ECONOMIC ACTIVITY HAS CONTINUED TO EXPAND AT A SOLID PACE.

58:32 ALTHOUGH GDP GROWTH MODERATED FROM 3.4% IN THE FOURTH QUARTER

58:36 OF LAST YEAR TO 1.6% IN THE FIRST QUARTER, PRIVATE DOMESTIC

58:40 FINAL PURCHASES WHICH EXCLUDES INVENTORY INVESTMENT, AND

58:44 EXPORTS, USUALLY SENDS A CLEAR SIGNAL ON UNDERLYING DEMAND WAS

58:46 3.1% IN THE FIRST QUARTER. AS STRONG AS THE SECOND HALF OF

58:50 2023. CONSUMER SPENDING HAS BEEN ROBUST OVER THE PAST SEVERAL

58:57 QUARTERS, EVEN AS HIGH INTEREST RATES HAVE WEIGHED ON HOUSING

59:01 AND EQUIPMENT INVESTMENT. IMPROVING SUPPLY CONDITIONS

59:06 HAVE SUPPORTED RESILIENT DEMAND AND THE STRONG PERFORMANCE OF

59:07 THE U.S. ECONOMY OVER THE PAST YEAR.

59:13 THE LABOR MARKET REMAINS RELATIVELY TIGHT, BUT SUPPLY

59:15 AND DEMAND CONDITIONS HAVE COME INTO BETTER BALANCE.

59:20 PAYROLL JOB GAINS AVERAGED 276,0 00 PER MONTH IN THE FIRST

59:24 QUARTER, WHILE THE UN-IMPLEMENT RATE REMAINS LOW AT 3.8%.

59:29 STRONG JOB CREATION OVER THE PAST YEAR HAS BEEN ACCOMPANIED

59:33 BY AN INCREASE IN THE SUPPLY OF WORKERS, REFLECTING INCREASES

59:35 IN PARTICIPATION AMONG INDIVIDUALS AGED 25 TO 54

59:39 YEARS, AND A CONTINUED STRONG PACE OF IMMIGRATION.

59:45 NNOMINAL WAGE GROWTH HAS EASED OVER THE PAST YEAR AND THE JOBS

59:48 TO WORKERS GAP HAS NARROWED, BUT LABOR DEMAND STILL EXCEEDS

59:52 THE SUPPLY OF AVAILABLE WORKERS. INFLATION HAS EASED NOTABLY

59:57 OVER THE PAST YEAR BUT REMAINS ABOVE ARE LONGER RUN GOAL OF 2%.

01:00:03 TOTAL PCE PRICES ROSE 2.7% OVER THE 12 MONTHS ENDING IN MARCH,

01:00:06 THEY SLOUGHED IN THE VOLATILE FOOD AND ENERGY CATEGORIES,

01:00:10 CORE PCE PRICES ROSE 2.8%. THE INFLATION DATA RECEIVED SO

01:00:14 FAR THIS YEAR HAVE BEEN HIGHER THAN EXPECTED.

01:00:18 ALTHOUGH, SOME MEASURES OF SHORT-TERM INFLATION

01:00:20 EXPECTATIONS HAVE INCREASED IN RECENT MONTHS, LONGER-TERM

01:00:22 INFLATION EXPECTATIONS APPEAR TO REMAIN WELL ANCHORED AS

01:00:28 REFLECTED IN A BROAD RANGE OF SERVICE OF HOUSEHOLDS,

01:00:31 BUSINESSES AND FORECASTERS, AS WELL AS MEASURES FROM FINANCIAL

01:00:32 MARKETS. THE FED'S MONETARY POLICY

01:00:36 ACTIONS ARE GUIDED BY OUR MANDATE TO PROMOTE MAXIMUM

01:00:39 EMPLOYMENT AND STABLE PRICES FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

01:00:44 MY COLLEAGUES AND I ARE ACUTELY AWARE THAT HIGH INFLATION

01:00:46 IMPOSES A SIGNIFICANT HARDSHIP AS IT ERODES PURCHASING POWER,

01:00:51 ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE LEAST ABLE TO MEET THE HIGHER COSTS OF

01:00:54 ESSENTIALS LIKE FOOD, HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION.

01:00:58 WE'RE STRONGLY COMMITTED TO RETURNING INFLATION TO OUR 2%

01:00:59 OBJECTIVE. THE COMMITTEE DECIDED AT

01:01:04 TODAY'S MEETING TO MAINTAIN THE TARGET RANGE FOR THE FUNDS RATE

01:01:10 AT 5.5% AND TO CONTINUE THE PROCESS OF SIGNIFICANTLY

01:01:13 REDUCING OUR SECURITIES HOLDINGS AT A SLOWER PACE.

01:01:18 OVER THE PAST YEAR, AS THE LABOR MARKET TIGHTNESS HAS

01:01:22 EASED AND INFLATION HAS DECLINED, THE RISKS TO

01:01:25 ACHIEVING OUR EMPLOYMENT AND INFLATION GOALS HAVE MOVED

01:01:28 TOWARDS BETTER BALANCE. THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK IS

01:01:31 UNCERTAIN AND WE REMAIN HIGHLY ATTENTIVE TO INFLATION RISKS.

01:01:36 WE'VE STATED THAT WE DO NOT EXPECT IT WILL BE APPROPRIATE

01:01:37 TO REDUCE THE TARGET RANGE FOR THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE UNTIL WE

01:01:41 HAVE GAINED GREATER CONFIDENCE THAT INFLATION IS MOVING

01:01:43 SUSTAINABLY TOWARDS 2%. SO FAR THIS YEAR, THE DATA DID

01:01:49 NOT GIVE US THAT GREATER CONFIDENCE.

01:01:52 IN PARTICULAR, READINGS ON INFLATION HAVE COME IN ABOVE

01:01:54 EXPECTATIONS. IT IS LIKELY THAT GAINING SUCH

01:01:59 GREATER CONFIDENCE WILL TAKE LONGER THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED.

01:02:02 WE'RE PREPARED TO MAINTAIN THE CURRENT TARGET RATE FOR THE

01:02:05 FEDERAL FUNDS RATE FOR AS LONG AS APPROPRIATE.

01:02:09 WE'RE ALSO PREPARED TO RESPOND TO UNEXPECTED WEAKENING IN THE

01:02:14 LABOR MARKET. WE KNOW THAT REDUCING POLICY

01:02:17 TOO SOON OR TOO MUCH COULD RESULT IN A REVERSAL OF THE

01:02:19 PROCESS WE HAVE SEEN ON INFLATION.

01:02:22 AT THE SAME TIME, BRUISING POLICY RESTRAINT TOO LATE OR

01:02:26 TOO LITTLE GOOD UNDULY WE CAN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND

01:02:30 EMPLOYMENT. IN CONSIDERING ANY ADJUSTMENTS

01:02:32 TO THE TARGET RANGE FOR THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE, THE

01:02:35 COMMITTEE WILL CAREFULLY ASSESS INCOMING DATA, THE EVOLVING

01:02:37 OUTLOOK AND THE BALANCE OF RISK. POLICY IS WELL-POSITIONED TO

01:02:41 DEAL WITH THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT WE FACE IN

01:02:44 PURSUING BOTH SIDES OF OUR DUAL MANDATE.

01:02:48 WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE DECISIONS MEETING BY MEETING.

01:02:51 TURNING TO OUR BALANCE SHEET. THE COMMITTEE DECIDED AT

01:02:56 TODAY'S MEETING TO SLOW THE PACE OF DECLINE IN OUR

01:02:57 SECURITIES HOLDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THE PLANS WE RELEASED

01:02:59 PREVIOUSLY. SPECIFICALLY, THE N TREASURY

01:03:03 REDEMPTIONS WILL BE LOWERED FROM THE CURRENT $60 BILLION

01:03:08 FROM TO $25 BILLION PER MONTH AS OF JUNE 1.

01:03:11 CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMITTEE'S INTENTION TO HOLD PRIMARILY

01:03:14 TREASURY SECURITIES IN THE LONGER RUN, WE ARE LEAVING THE

01:03:18 CAP 1 AGENCY SECURITY IS UNCHANGED PER MONTH AND WILL

01:03:20 REINVEST ANY PROCEEDS IN EXCESS OF THIS CAP IN TREASURY

01:03:23 SECURITIES. WITH PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON

01:03:28 AGENCY SECURITIES RUNNING AT ABOUT 5 BILLION PER MONTH,

01:03:30 THE TOTAL PORTFOLIO RUNOFF WOULD AMOUNT TO ROUGHLY $40

01:03:33 BILLION PER MONTH. THE DECISION TO SLOW THE PACE

01:03:38 OF RUNOFF DOES NOT MEAN OUR BALANCE SHEET WILL ULTIMATELY

01:03:42 SHRINK LESS THAN IT WOULD OTHERWISE, BUT IT ALLOWS US TO

01:03:43 APPROACH ITS ULTIMATE LEVEL WERE GRADUALLY.

01:03:48 IN PARTICULAR, SLOWING THE PACE OF RUNOFF WILL HELP ENSURE A

01:03:49 SMOOTH TRANSITION. REDUCING THE POSSIBILITY THAT

01:03:54 MONEY MARKETS EXPERIENCE STRESS, AND THEREBY

01:03:56 FACILITATING THE ONGOING DECLINE IN OUR SECURITIES

01:03:58 HOLDINGS. THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH

01:04:00 REACHING THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF AMPLE RESERVES.

01:04:05 WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO BRINGING INFLATION BACK DOWN TO OUR 2%

01:04:08 GOAL AND TO KEEPING LONGER-TERM INFLATION EXPECTATIONS WELL

01:04:10 ANCHORED. RESTORING PRICE STABILITY IS

01:04:16 ESSENTIAL TO SET THE STAGE FOR ACHIEVING MAXIMUM EMPLOYMENT

01:04:17 AND STABLE PRICES OVER THE LONGER RUN.

01:04:20 TO CONCLUDE, WE UNDERSTAND THAT OUR ACTIONS AFFECT COMMUNITIES,

01:04:24 FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

01:04:27 EVERYTHING WE DO IS IN SERVICE TO OUR PUBLIC VISION.

01:04:30 WE AT THE FED WILL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ACHIEVE

01:04:33 OUR MAXIMUM EMPLOYMENT AND PRICE STABILITY GOALS.

01:04:35 THANK YOU. I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR

01:04:36 QUESTIONS.

01:04:46 >> TO FOLLOW UP, DO YOU CONSIDER THE CURRENT POLICY

01:04:51 RATE, ARE YOU CONFIDENT IT IS SUFFICIENTLY RESTRICTIVE TO GET

01:04:53 INFLATION BACK TO 2%? CHAIR POWELL:

01:04:58 I DO THINK THE EVIDENCE SHOWS PRETTY CLEARLY THAT POLICY IS

01:05:00 RESTRICTIVE AND WEIGHING ON DEMAND.

01:05:03 AND THERE ARE FEW PLACES I WOULD POINT TO FOR THAT.

01:05:05 YOU CAN START WITH THE LABOR MARKET.

01:05:09 DEMAND IS STILL STRONG, THE DEMAND SIDE OF THE LABOR MARKET

01:05:11 IN PARTICULAR. IT HAS COOLED FROM HIS EXTREME

01:05:15 LEHIGH LEVEL FROM A FEW YEARS AGO AND YOU SEE THAT IN JOB

01:05:16 OPENINGS. YOU SOME MORE OF THAT TODAY IN

01:05:19 THE JOEL'S REPORT. IT IS STILL HIGHER THAN

01:05:24 PRE-PANDEMIC BUT IT HAS BEEN COMING DOWN.

01:05:26 THAT IS DEMAND COOLING. THE SAME IS TRUE OF QUITS AND

01:05:31 HIRING RATES WHICH HAVE NORMALIZED.

01:05:38 I ALSO LOOK AT THE SURVEYS OF WORKERS AND BUSINESSES THAT ASK

01:05:43 WORKERS ARE JOBS PLENTIFUL AND ASK BUSINESSES ARE WORKERS WENT

01:05:47 TO VOTE? YOU HAVE SEEN THE ANSWERS HAVE

01:05:50 COME BACK DOWN TO PRE-PANDEMIC LEVELS.

01:05:55 YOU ALSO SEE IN SPENDING LIKE HOUSING AND INVESTMENT, YOU SEE

01:05:58 THAT HIGHER INTEREST RATES ARE WEIGHING ON THOSE ACTIVITIES.

01:06:02 I DO THINK IT IS CLEAR THAT POLICY IS RESTRICTIVE.

01:06:06 >> SUFFICIENTLY RESTRICTIVE, I GUESS? CHAIR POWELL:

01:06:11 I WOULD SAY WE BELIEVE IT IS RESTRICTIVE AND WE BELIEVE OVER

01:06:12 TIME IT WILL BE SUFFICIENTLY RESTRICTIVE.

01:06:16 THAT WILL BE A QUESTION THAT THE DATA HAS TO ANSWER.

01:06:19 >> IF INFLATION CONTINUES RUNNING ROUGHLY SIDEWAYS AS IT

01:06:24 HAS BEEN, THE JOB MARKET STAYS REASONABLY STRONG, UNEMPLOYMENT

01:06:29 LOW, EXPECTATIONS ARE ANCHORED AND MAINTAINED -- CHAIR POWELL:

01:06:33 EXPECTATIONS ARE ANCHORED?

01:06:35 >> STABLE, ROUGHLY. WOULD YOU DISRUPT THAT FOR THE

01:06:38 LAST HALF POINT ON PCE? CHAIR POWELL:

01:06:42 I DON'T WANT TO GET INTO COMPLICATED HYPOTHETICALS BUT I

01:06:44 WOULD SAY WE ARE COMMITTED TO RETAINING OUR CURRENT

01:06:48 RESTRICTIVE STANCE AND POLICY FOR AS LONG AS IT IS

01:06:49 APPROPRIATE.

01:06:58 >> THANK YOU FOR TAKING OUR QUESTIONS.

01:07:03 I WONDER, OBVIOUSLY, MICHELLE BOWMAN HAS BEEN SAYING THERE IS

01:07:08 A RISK THAT RATES MAY NEED TO INCREASE FURTHER, OF THE WOOD

01:07:10 IS ON HER BASELINE OUTLOOK. DO YOU SEE THAT IS A RISK AS

01:07:13 WELL AND WHAT CHANGE IN CONDITIONS WOULD MERIT CONSIDER

01:07:16 RAISING RATES AT THIS POINT? CHAIR POWELL:

01:07:20 I THINK IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE NEXT POLICY RATE MOVE WILL BE A

01:07:21 HIKE. I WOULD SAY IT IS UNLIKELY.

01:07:27 OUR POLICY FOCUS IS REALLY WHAT I MENTIONED WHICH IS HOW LONG

01:07:31 TO KEEP POLICY RESTRICTIVE YOU ASK WHAT WOULD IT TAKE?

01:07:36 I THINK WE WOULD NEED TO SEE PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE THAT OUR

01:07:38 POLICY STANCE NOT RESTRICTIVE TO BRING INFLATION SUSTAINABLY

01:07:41 DOWN TO 2% OVER TIME. THAT IS NOT WHAT WE THINK WE

01:07:43 ARE SEEING. SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS WHAT IT

01:07:45 WOULD TAKE. WE LOOK AT THE TOTALITY OF THE

01:07:49 DATA. THAT WOULD INCLUDE INFLATION,

01:07:52 INFLATION EXPECTATIONS AND ALL THE OTHER DATA.

01:08:00 >> [INDISCERNIBLE] CHAIR POWELL: WHAT I AM SAYING IS IF WE WERE

01:08:07 TO COME TO THAT CONCLUSION, THAT POLICY WOULD BE TIGHT

01:08:09 ENOUGH TO ACHIEVE THAT. IT WOULD BE THE TOTALITY OF ALL

01:08:12 THE THINGS WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT. IT COULD BE EXPECTATIONS, IT

01:08:16 COULD BE A COMBINATION OF THINGS.

01:08:19 IF WE REACH THAT CONCLUSION AND DON'T SEE EVIDENCE SUPPORTING

01:08:21 IT, THAT IS WHAT WE WOULD TAKE TO TAKE THAT STEP.

01:08:27 >> THANK YOU. YOU DID NOT MENTION THE IDEA

01:08:34 THAT RATES ARE AT A PEAK FOR THE CYCLE AND DID NOT MENTION

01:08:36 THE IDEA AND MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE TO CUT RATES LATER

01:08:39 THIS YEAR, AS YOU HAVE IN PREVIOUS PRESS CONFERENCES.

01:08:43 HAS THE FED DROPPED ITS EASING BIAS? CHAIR POWELL:

01:08:47 LET ME ADDRESS CUTS. OBVIOUSLY, OUR DECISIONS WE

01:08:53 MAKE ON THE POLICY RATE WILL DEPEND ON THE INCOMING DATA,

01:08:55 HOW THE OUTLOOK IS EVOLVING AND THE BALLASNCE -- BALANCE OF

01:09:00 RISKS. WE THINK THAT POLICY IS

01:09:06 WELL-POSITIONED TO ADDRESS DIFFERENT PATHS THE ECONOMY

01:09:07 MIGHT TAKE. WE HAVE SAID WE DON'T THINK IT

01:09:11 WILL BE APPROPRIATE TO DOLL BACKER RESTRICTIVE POLICY

01:09:14 STANCE UNTIL WE HAVE GAINED GREATER CONFIDENCE THAT

01:09:17 INFLATION IS MOVING SUSTAINABLY TOWARDS 2%.

01:09:20 FOR FOR EXAMPLE, LET ME TAKE A PATH.

01:09:23 IF WE DID HAVE A PATH WHERE INFLATION PROVES MORE

01:09:25 PERSISTENT THAN EXPECTED AND WITH A LABOR MARKET REMAINING

01:09:30 STRONG, BUT INFLATION IS MOVING SIDEWAYS AND WE ARE NOT GETTING

01:09:31 GREATER CONFIDENCE. THAT WOULD BE A CASE IN WHICH

01:09:35 IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO HOLD OFF ON RATE CUTS.

01:09:39 I THINK THERE ARE OTHER PATHS THE ECONOMY COULD TAKE WHICH

01:09:41 WOULD CAUSE US TO WANT TO CONSIDER RATE CUTS.

01:09:47 TWO OF THOSE PATHS WOULD BE WE DO GAME GREATER CONFIDENCE AS

01:09:52 WE SAID, THAT INFLATION IS MOVING DOWN TO 2%.

01:09:55 ANOTHER PATH COULD BE AN UNEXPECTED WEAKENING IN THE

01:09:57 LABOR MARKET, FOR EXAMPLE. THOSE ARE PATHS IN WHICH YOU

01:10:01 COULD SEE US CUTTING RATES. IT REALLY WILL DEPEND ON THE

01:10:03 DATA.

01:10:09 IN TERMS OF PEAK RATE, I THINK IT IS THE SAME QUESTION.

01:10:13 I THINK THE DATA WILL HAVE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION FOR US.

01:10:19 >> ON THE PATH WHERE YOU MIGHT NOT CUT, YOU MENTIONED THERE

01:10:25 WOULD BE INFLATION PERSISTENT -- WITHOUT BE THE KEY DATA IN

01:10:26 MAKING THAT DECISION? CAN YOU ASK CLAYMORE -- EXPLAIN

01:10:31 MORE? CHAIR POWELL: WE HAVE SET OURSELVES A TEST

01:10:36 THAT FOR US TO BEGIN TO REDUCE POLICY RESTRICTION, WE WANT TO

01:10:42 BE CONFIDENT THAT INFLATION IS MOVING SUSTAINABLY DOWN TO 2%.

01:10:45 FOR SURE, ONE OF THE THINGS WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT IS THE

01:10:47 PERFORMANCE OF INFLATION. WE ARE LOOKING AT THE WHOLE

01:10:49 STORY. CLEARLY, INCOMING INFLATION

01:10:54 DATA WOULD BE AT THE VERY HEART OF THAT DECISION.

01:11:07 >> TO WHAT EXTENT HAS THE EASING IN FINANCIAL CONDITION

01:11:13 SINCE NOVEMBER CONTRIBUTED TO THE RE-ACCELERATION IN GROWTH?

01:11:18 DO YOU NOT EXPECT A PERIOD OF SUSTAINED TIGHTER FINANCIAL

01:11:21 CONDITIONS WILL BE NEEDED TO RESUME THIS SORT OF

01:11:24 DISINFLATION THE ECONOMY SAW LAST YEAR? CHAIR POWELL:

01:11:27 I THINK IT IS HARD TO KNOW THAT. WE WILL BE ABLE TO LOOK BACK

01:11:31 DOWN THE ROAD AND UNDERSTAND IT BETTER.

01:11:37 IF YOU LOOK AT -- LET'S LOOK AT GROWTH, REALLY, WHAT WE'VE SEEN

01:11:41 SO FAR THIS YEAR IN THE FIRST QUARTER IS GROWTH COMING IN

01:11:44 ABOUT CONSISTENT FROM WHERE WAS LAST YEAR.

01:11:45 I KNOW GDP CAME IN LOWER. YOU DON'T SEE AN ACCELERATION

01:11:48 IN GROWTH. FINANCIAL CONDITIONS LOOSEN IN

01:11:53 DECEMBER AND THAT CAUSED AN UPTICK IN ACTIVITY AND THAT

01:11:57 CAUSED INFLATION, PRESUMABLY. YOU DON'T REALLY SEE THAT

01:11:59 HAPPENING. WHAT YOU SEE IS ECONOMIC

01:12:04 ACTIVITY AT A LEVEL THAT IS ROUGHLY THE SAME AS LAST YEAR.

01:12:10 WHAT IS CAUSING THIS INFLATION WILL HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF

01:12:11 THAT OVERTIME. I DON'T KNOW THERE'S AN OBVIOUS

01:12:15 CONNECTION WITH EASING OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS FOR IN

01:12:17 TERMS OF TIGHTENING, YOU ARE RIGHT.

01:12:20 RATES ARE HIGHER NOW AND HAVE BEEN FOR SOME TIME THAN THEY

01:12:23 WERE BEFORE THE DECEMBER MEETING.

01:12:25 THEY ARE HIGHER AND THAT IS TIGHTER FINANCIAL CONDITIONS.

01:12:29 THAT IS APPROPRIATE GIVEN WHAT INFLATION HAS DONE IN THE FIRST

01:12:32 QUARTER.

01:12:33 >> YOU SAID IN THE PAST THAT STRONGER GROWTH WOULD NOT

01:12:35 NECESSARILY PRECLUDE RATE CUTS. I'M WONDERING IF CONTINUED

01:12:40 STRENGTH IN THE LABOR MARKET WOULD CHANGE YOUR VIEW ON

01:12:42 APPROPRIATE STANZA POLICY IF IT IS ACCOMPANIED BY SIGNS THAT

01:12:46 WAGE GROWTH IS RE-ACCELERATING? CHAIR POWELL:

01:12:49 I WANT TO BE CAREFUL THAT WE DON'T TARGET WAGE GROWTH WITH A

01:12:50 LABOR MARKET. REMEMBER WHAT WE SAW LAST YEAR,

01:12:56 VERY STRONG GROWTH, VERY TIGHT LABOR MARKET AND HISTORICALLY

01:12:57 FAST DECLINE IN INFLATION. THAT IS BECAUSE WE KNOW THERE

01:13:00 ARE TWO FORCES AT WORK. THERE'S THE UNWINDING OF THE

01:13:06 PANDEMIC RELATED SUPPLY-SIDE DISTORTIONS AND DEMAND-SIDE

01:13:10 DISTORTIONS AND ALSO MONETARY POLICY, RESTRICTIVE MONETARY

01:13:13 POLICY. I WOULD NOT RULE OUT THAT

01:13:16 SOMETHING LIKE THAT CAN CONTINUE.

01:13:20 I WOULD NOT GIVE UP ON FURTHER THINGS HAPPENING ON THE

01:13:22 SUPPLY-SIDE EITHER BECAUSE WE

01:13:28 DO SEE THAT COMPANY STILL REPORT THAT THERE ARE

01:13:30 SUPPLY-SIDE ISSUES THAT THEY ARE FACING.

01:13:32 EVEN WHEN THE SUPPLY-SIDE ISSUES ARE SOLVED, IT SHOULD

01:13:35 TAKE SOME TIME FOR THAT TO AFFECT ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND

01:13:36 INFLATION. THERE ARE STILL THOSE THINGS.

01:13:41 I DON'T LIKE TO SAY THAT NEITHER GROWTH OR A STRONG

01:13:46 LABOR MARKET IN AND OF ITSELF WOULD AUTOMATICALLY CREATE

01:13:50 PROBLEMS ON INFLATION BECAUSE IT DIDN'T DO THAT LAST YEAR.

01:13:52 YOU ASKED ABOUT WAGES. WE DON'T TARGET WAGES, WE

01:13:56 TARGET PRICE INFLATION. IT IS ONE OF THE INPUTS.

01:14:03 THE POINT WAS WAGES IS LIKE EVERYONE ELSE, WE LIKE TO SEE

01:14:06 HIGH WAGES BUT WE ALSO WANT TO SEE THEM NOT ENOUGH BY HIGH

01:14:07 INFLATION. THAT IS REALLY WHAT WE ARE

01:14:14 TRYING TO DO, COOL THE ECONOMY AND WORK WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING

01:14:19 ON THE SUPPLY-SIDE TO BRING THE ECONOMY BACK TO 2% INFLATION.

01:14:23 PART OF THAT WILL PROBABLY BE HAVING WAGE INCREASES MOVE DOWN

01:14:27 INCREMENTALLY TOWARDS LEVELS THAT ARE MORE SUSTAINABLE.

01:14:35 >> RACHEL SIEGEL FROM THE WASHINGTON POST. YOU TALKED

01:14:41 ABOUT NEEDING TIME TO GAIN MORE CONFIDENCE THAT INFLATION IS

01:14:42 SUSTAINABLY MOVING BACK DOWN TO 2%. IT IS MAY NOW.

01:14:47 DO YOU HAVE TIME THIS YEAR TO CUT THREE TIMES IN THE CALENDAR?

01:14:51 CHAIR POWELL: I AM NOT REALLY THINKING OF IT

01:14:52 THAT WAY. WHAT WE SAID IS WE NEED TO BE

01:14:59 MORE CONFIDENT AND WE'VE SAID, MY COLLEAGUES AND I SAID TODAY

01:15:04 THAT WE DID NOT SEE PROGRESS IN THE FIRST QUARTER.

01:15:09 I HAVE SAID IT APPEARS THEN THAT IT WILL TAKE LONGER FOR US

01:15:12 TO REACH THAT POINT. I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT WILL

01:15:13 TAKE. I WILL JUST SAY THAT WHEN WE

01:15:19 GET THAT CONFIDENCE, RATE CUTS WILL BE IN SCOPE.

01:15:23 I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHEN THAT WILL BE.

01:15:28 >> OTHER ANY SIGNS YOU CAN LOOK BACK ON NOW THAT SUGGESTED

01:15:33 SOMETHING MORE WORRYING THAN JUST EXPECTED BUMPING US?

01:15:37 -- BUMPINESS? CHAIR POWELL: NOT REALLY.

01:15:45 I THOUGHT IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO RESERVE JUDGMENT UNTIL WE HAVE

01:15:48 THE MARCH DATA. WHAT DO WE NOW SEE IN THE FIRST

01:15:51 QUARTER? WE SEE STRONG ECONOMIC ACTIVITY.

01:15:57 WE SEE A STRONG LABOR MARKET AND WE SEE THREE INFLATION

01:15:58 READINGS. I THINK YOU ARE AT A POINT

01:16:02 WHERE YOU SHOULD TAKE SOME SIGNAL.

01:16:06 WE DON'T LIKE TO REACT ONE OR TWO MONTHS DATA BUT THIS IS A

01:16:10 FULL QUARTER AND I THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE TO TAKE SIGNAL NOW.

01:16:13 THE SIGNAL WE ARE TAKING IS THAT IS LIKELY TO TAKE LONGER

01:16:17 FOR US TO GAIN CONFIDENCE THAT WE ARE ON A SUSTAINABLE PATH TO

01:16:19 2% INFLATION. THAT IS THE SIGNAL WE ARE

01:16:22 TAKING.

01:16:29 >> IF I COULD FOLLOW UP ON THAT. WHAT PARTICULAR AREAS WERE

01:16:36 TEMPORARY OR BLIPS IN THE INFLATION DATA IN THE FIRST

01:16:38 QUARTER AND WHAT IS THE DYNAMIC BY WHAT YOU EXPECT HER TO WORK

01:16:40 OUT IN THE COMING MONTHS AND QUARTERS? CHAIR POWELL:

01:16:47 WE WILL PUT -- WE HAVE PUT THE THING UNDER A MICROSCOPE.

01:16:49 I WILL SAY NOTHING WILL COME OUT OF THAT THAT WILL CHANGE

01:16:51 THE VIEW. I THINK THAT IN FACT WE DID NOT

01:16:54 GAIN CONFIDENCE AND IT WILL TAKE LONGER TO GET THAT

01:16:58 CONFIDENCE. I JUST THINK -- YOU KNOW THE

01:17:00 STORY. WHAT'S HAPPENED SINCE DECEMBER

01:17:06 IS YOU HAVE SEEN HIGHER GOODS INFLATION THAN EXPECTED.

01:17:10 WE HAVE SEEN HIGHER HOUSING SERVICES THAN EXPECTED.

01:17:13 THOSE TWO ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO BE HIGHER THAN WE THOUGHT.

01:17:18 THERE ARE STORIES BEHIND HOW THAT HAPPENED.

01:17:22 I THINK MY EXPECTATION IS THAT WE WILL OVER THE COURSE OF THIS

01:17:26 YEAR SEE INFLATION MOVE BACK DOWN.

01:17:30 THAT IS MY FORECAST. I THINK MY CONFIDENCE IN THAT IS LOWER

01:17:34 THAN IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE DATA THAT WE'VE SEEN.

01:17:36 WE ARE LOOKING AT THOSE THINGS. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO EXPECT AND

01:17:43 I CONTINUE TO EXPECT THAT HOUSING INFLATION WILL SHOW UP

01:17:48 IN MEASURED HOUSING SERVICES INFLATION OVER TIME.

01:17:54 IT LOOKS LIKE THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL LAGS BETWEEN WHEN

01:17:59 LOWER MARKET RATES TURN UP FOR NEW TENANTS AND WHEN IT SHOWS

01:18:03 UP FOR EXISTING TENANTS OR FOR HOUSING SERVICES.

01:18:07 >> IF I COULD FOLLOW UP. IS THERE A CONTRADICTION IN THE

01:18:12 IDEA THAT YOU ARE REDUCING QUANTITATIVE TIGHTENING, WHICH

01:18:16 IS SORT OF AN EASING, WHILE YOU ARE HOLDING RATES STEADY AT A

01:18:18 RESTRICTIVE RATE TO TRY TO COOL THE ECONOMY ON INFLATION?

01:18:20 CHAIR POWELL: I WOULDN'T SAY THAT, NO.

01:18:23 THE ACTIVE TOOL OF MONETARY POLICY IS INTEREST RATES.

01:18:28 THIS IS A LONG, A PLAN WE'VE LONG HAD IN PLACE TO SLOW, NOT

01:18:36 IN ORDER TO PROVIDE ACCOMMODATION FOR THE ECONOMY

01:18:41 OR TO BE LESS RESTRICTIVE. IT IS TO ENSURE THAT THE

01:18:46 PROCESS OF SHRINKING THE BALANCE SHEET DOWN TO WHERE WE

01:18:48 WANT TO GET IT IS A SMOOTH ONE AND DOES NOT WIND UP WITH

01:18:52 FINANCIAL MARKET TURMOIL THE WAY IT DID THE LAST TIME WE DID

01:18:56 THIS AND THE OTHER TIME WE ONLY EVER DONE THIS.

01:19:04 >> TWO QUESTIONS. FIRST IS A SIMPLE ONE.

01:19:10 GIVEN THE RUN OF DATA SINCE MARCH, HAS THE PROBABILITY IN

01:19:14 YOUR MIND OF NO CUTS THIS YEAR INCREASED OR STAY THE SAME?

01:19:18 THAT IS THE FIRST QUESTION. SECOND QUESTION, YOU JOINED THE

01:19:22 BOARD IN 2012. I AM SURE YOU REMEMBER AS I DO

01:19:27 WITH THE JOBLESS RECOVERY WAS LIKE.

01:19:31 LAWYERS, ACCOUNTANTS, ALL KINDS OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED PEOPLE WHO

01:19:33 COULDN'T GET JOBS. GIVEN YOUR HISTORY THERE, I

01:19:37 WONDER IF THERE'S AN ARGUMENT FOR BEING MORE PATIENT WITH

01:19:40 INFLATION HERE. WE HAVE STRONG PRODUCTIVITY

01:19:43 GROWTH. THAT IS HELPING WAGES GO UP.

01:19:48 WE HAVE GOOD EMPLOYMENT. SO, IT SEEMS TO ME THERE'S A

01:19:53 LOT OF HYSTERIA ABOUT INFLATION. I AGREE, NOBODY LIKES IT.

01:19:59 BUT, IS THERE AN ARGUMENT FOR BEING PATIENT AND WORKING WITH

01:20:01 THE ECONOMIC CYCLE TO GET IT DOWN OVER TIME? THANK YOU.

01:20:04 CHAIR POWELL: ON YOUR FIRST QUESTION, I DON'T

01:20:07 HAVE A PROBABILITY ESTIMATE FOR YOU.

01:20:13 ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT WE HAVE SAID WE DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD

01:20:15 BE APPROPRIATE TO CUT UNTIL WE WERE MORE CONFIDENT THAT

01:20:18 INFLATION WAS MOVING SUSTAINABLY TO 2%.

01:20:23 OUR CONFIDENCE IN THAT DID NOT INCREASE IN THE FIRST QUARTER.

01:20:25 WHAT REALLY HAPPENED IS WE CAME TO THE VIEW THAT IT WILL TAKE

01:20:28 LONGER TO GET THAT CONFIDENCE.

01:20:34 I THINK THE ECONOMY HAS BEEN VERY HARD FOR FORECASTERS

01:20:38 BROADLY TO PREDICT ITS PATH. BUT THERE ARE PATHS TO NOT

01:20:42 CUTTING AND PATHS TO CUTTING. IT WILL REALLY DEPEND ON THE

01:20:46 DATA PAID -- DATA. IN TERMS OF THE MANDATE, IF YOU

01:20:52 GO BACK A COUPLE YEARS, OUR SORT OF FRAMEWORK DOCUMENT SAYS

01:20:57 THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TWO MENDE GOALS.

01:21:01 IF ONE OF THEM IS FURTHER AWAY FROM GOAL THAN THE OTHER, YOU

01:21:04 FOCUS ON THAT ONE. IT IS THE TIME TO GET BACK

01:21:09 THERE. THAT WAS CLEARLY INFLATION.

01:21:13 OUR FOCUS WAS VERY MUCH ON INFLATION.

01:21:18 THIS IS WHAT WE REFERRED TO IN THE STATEMENT.

01:21:22 AS INFLATION HAS COME DOWN NOW TO BELOW 3% ON A 12 MONTH

01:21:29 BASIS, IT HAS BECOME -- WE ARE NOW FOCUSING, THE OTHER GOAL

01:21:34 NOW COMES BACK INTO FOCUS. WE ARE FOCUSING ON IT.

01:21:39 AND THAT IS HOW WE THINK ABOUT THAT.

01:21:48 >> THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS.

01:21:52 JUST TO GO BACK TO THE ANSWER BEFORE, THE PREVIOUS ONE.

01:21:57 IT SEEMS TO SUGGEST YOU THINK THE LIKELIEST PATH OF INFLATION

01:22:02 IS ONE THAT WILL ALLOW YOU, A SITUATION WHERE RATES ARE LOWER

01:22:04 AT THE END OF THE YEAR THAN THEY ARE RIGHT NOW.

01:22:08 IT WOULD BE GOOD IF YOU CAN CONFIRM WHETHER OR NOT THAT IS

01:22:14 A CORRECT READING.

01:22:15 AND THE KEY GDP PRINT HAS LED SOME TO START MENTIONING THE

01:22:17 TERM STAGFLATION WITH RESPECT TO THE U.S. ECONOMY.

01:22:22 DO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE ON THE FOMC THINK THIS IS NOW A RISK?

01:22:24 THANK YOU. CHAIR POWELL: I'M NOT DEALING IN LIKELIHOODS.

01:22:32 I THINK THERE ARE PATHS THAT THE ECONOMY CAN TAKE THAT WOULD

01:22:36 INVOLVE CUTS AND PATHS THAT WOULDN'T.

01:22:39 I DON'T HAVE GREAT CONFIDENCE IN WHICH OF THOSE PATHS.

01:22:42 I WOULD SAY MY PERSONAL FORECAST IS WE WILL BEGIN TO

01:22:45 SEE FURTHER PROGRESS ON INFLATION THIS YEAR.

01:22:47 I DON'T KNOW IF IT WILL BE ENOUGH, I DON'T KNOW IF IT

01:22:51 WON'T. WE WILL HAVE TO LET THE DATA

01:22:53 LEAD US ON THAT. YOUR SECOND QUESTION WAS

01:22:56 STAGFLATION. I GUESS I WOULD SAY I WAS

01:23:03 AROUND FOR STAGFLATION AND IT WAS 10% UNEMPLOYMENT.

01:23:08 IT WAS HIGH SINGLE DIGITS INFLATION.

01:23:13 RIGHT NOW -- AND VERY SLOW GROWTH.

01:23:19 RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE 3% GROWTH WHICH IS PRETTY SOLID GROWTH, I

01:23:21 WOULD SAY, BY ANY MEASURE. WE HAVE INFLATION RUNNING UNDER

01:23:23 3%. I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHERE

01:23:27 THAT'S COMING FROM.

01:23:33 IN ADDITION, I WOULD SAY MOST FORECASTERS, INCLUDING OUR

01:23:37 FORECASTING, WAS THAT LAST YEAR'S LEVEL OF GROWTH WAS VERY

01:23:43 HIGH, 3.4% IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, AND PROBABLY NOT GOING

01:23:45 TO BE SUSTAINED AND WOULD COME DOWN.

01:23:50 THAT WOULD BE OUR FORECAST. THAT WOULDN'T BE STAGFLATION.

01:23:52 THAT WOULD BE TO A VERY HEALTHY LEVEL OF GROWTH.

01:23:56 WITH INFLATION, WE WILL RETURN INFLATION TO DO PERCENT AND I

01:24:03 DON'T SEE THE STAG OR THE FLATION. [LAUGHTER]

01:24:09 >> MICHAEL MCKEE FROM BLOOMBERG RADIO AND TELEVISION.

01:24:14 THE VICE CHAIR OF THE FOMC SAID RECENTLY HE'S WILLING TO

01:24:15 CONSIDER THE IDEA THAT POTENTIAL GROWTH HAS MOVED UP.

01:24:20 OF COURSE, MR. POTENTIAL GROWTH. DO YOU SHARE THAT VIEW AND WITH

01:24:25 THAT IMPLY THAT MAYBE POLICY IS NOT TIGHT ENOUGH? CHAIR POWELL:

01:24:30 I THINK I WOULD TAKE THAT QUESTION THIS WAY.

01:24:34 WE SAW A YEAR A VERY HIGH PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH IN 2023.

01:24:38 WE SAW YEAR OF NEGATIVE PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH IN 2022.

01:24:45 I THINK IT IS HARD TO DRAW FROM THE DATA. THE QUESTION IS WILL

01:24:49 PRODUCTIVITY -- TWO QUESTIONS. WILL PRODUCTIVITY RUN

01:24:53 PERSISTENTLY ABOVE ITS LONGER RUN TREND?

01:24:55 I DON'T THINK WE KNOW THAT. IN TERMS OF POTENTIAL OUTPUT,

01:24:58 THAT IS A SEPARATE QUESTION. WE'VE HAD WHAT AMOUNTS TO A

01:25:06 SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE POTENTIAL OUTPUT OF THE ECONOMY.

01:25:12 IT WAS ABOUT HAVING MORE LABOR, BOTH THROUGH PARTICIPATION.

01:25:19 WE ARE VERY MUCH LIKE OTHER FORECASTERS AND ECONOMISTS

01:25:22 GETTING OUR ARMS AROUND WHAT THAT MEANS FOR POTENTIAL OUTPUT

01:25:25 THIS YEAR AND NEXT YEAR, AND LAST YEAR FOR THAT MATTER.

01:25:29 IN THAT CASE, YOU REALLY DO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN

01:25:33 POTENTIAL OUTPUT, BUT YOU'VE ALSO GOT MORE SUPPLY.

01:25:37 THOSE PEOPLE ALSO COME IN AND THEY WORK AND THEY HAVE JOBS

01:25:38 AND THEY SPEND. YOU'VE ALSO GOT DEMAND.

01:25:44 IT MAY BE THAT YOU GET MORE SUPPLY THAN YOU GET DEMAND AT

01:25:47 THE BEGINNING, BUT ULTIMATELY, IT SHOULD NOT EITHER BE

01:25:50 INFLATIONARY OR DISINFLATIONARY OVER A LONGER PERIOD.

01:25:55 >> YOU SAID EARLIER THAT AT THIS POINT, YOU ARE NOT REALLY

01:26:00 CONSIDERING RATE INCREASES IF GROWTH IS HIGHER, BUT YOU ARE

01:26:02 NOT CONSIDERING RATE INCREASES. DOES THAT IMPLY YOU ARE MORE

01:26:06 WORRIED ABOUT CAUSING THE ECONOMY TO SLOW TOO MUCH THEN

01:26:11 YOU ARE ABOUT INFLATION TAKING OFF? CHAIR POWELL:

01:26:16 WE BELIEVE OUR POLICY STANCE IS IN A GOOD PLACE AND IT IS

01:26:17 APPROPRIATE TO THE CURRENT SITUATION.

01:26:19 WE BELIEVE IT IS RESTRICTIVE. OUR EVIDENCE FOR THAT, I WENT

01:26:24 OVER EARLIER. YOU SEE IT IN THE LABOR MARKET

01:26:27 AND INFLATION SENSITIVE SPENDING WHERE DEMAND HAS COME

01:26:31 DOWN A LOT OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS.

01:26:35 THAT IS MORE FROM MONETARY POLICY, WHEREAS THE SUPPLY-SIDE

01:26:38 THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING ARE MORE ON THE SUPPLY-SIDE.

01:26:41 THAT IS HOW WE THINK ABOUT IT.

01:26:44 >> THANK YOU. EDWARD LAWRENCE FROM

01:26:47 FOXBUSINESS. GDP GROWTH IS ABOUT --

01:26:51 EMPLOYMENT IS ABOUT 4%. IT FEELS LIKE A STEADY STATE

01:26:55 AND WE HAVE 3% INFLATION. IF THE DATA REMAINS THE SAME,

01:27:01 AND I KNOW YOU DON'T SEE A RATE HIKE, BUT IT STANDS TO REASON

01:27:03 THAT YOU NEED A RATE HIKE TO GET FROM 3% TO 2% INFLATION.

01:27:05 WAS THERE ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT A RATE HIKE IN TODAY'S MEETING?

01:27:11 AND ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH 3% INFLATION FOR THE REST OF THE

01:27:12 YEAR? CHAIR POWELL: OF COURSE, WE ARE NOT SATISFIED

01:27:17 WITH 3% INFLATION.

01:27:24 3% CANNOT BE SATISFYING. WE WILL RETURN INFLATION TO DO

01:27:29 PERCENT OVER TIME -- 2% OVER TIME.

01:27:31 WITHING OUR POLICY STANCE IS APPROPRIATE TO DO THAT.

01:27:34 IF WE WERE TO CONCLUDE THAT POLICY IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY

01:27:39 RESTRICTIVE TO BRING INFLATION SUSTAINABLY TO DO PERCENT, THEN

01:27:42 -- 2%, THEN THAT IS WHAT IT WILL TAKE FOR US TO INCREASE

01:27:46 RATES. WE DON'T SEE EVIDENCE FOR THAT.

01:27:49 >> WAS THERE DISCUSSION ABOUT A RATE HIKE AT ALL? CHAIR POWELL:

01:27:54 THE POLICY FOCUS HAS BEEN ON

01:28:01 WHAT TO DO ABOUT HOLDING THE CURRENT LEVEL OF RESTRICTION.

01:28:05 THAT IS PART OF THE POLICY, THAT IS WHERE THE POLICY

01:28:10 DISCUSSION WAS.

01:28:11 >> IS THERE A TIMEFRAME OF PERSISTENT INFLATION THAT WOULD

01:28:12 TRIGGER A RATE HIKE? CHAIR POWELL:

01:28:15 THERE IS NOT ANY RULE. THESE WILL BE JUDGED BY THE

01:28:18 CALLS. CLEARLY, RESTRICTIVE MONETARY

01:28:21 POLICY NEEDS MORE TIME TO DO ITS JOB.

01:28:25 THAT IS PRETTY CLEAR BASED ON WHAT WE ARE SEEING.

01:28:28 HOW LONG THAT WILL TAKE AN OUTPATIENT WE SHOULD BE WILL

01:28:30 DEPEND ON THE TOTALITY OF THE DATA AND THE OUTLOOK EVOLVING.

01:28:40 >> YOU HAVE TALKED ABOUT YOUR COMMITMENT TO BEING A POLITICAL

01:28:42 AND NONPARTISAN. I AM WONDERING GIVEN IT WAS AN

01:28:48 ELECTION YEAR, IS THE BAR FOR RATE CHANGES HIGHER CLOSE TO AN

01:28:49 ELECTION? SIMILARLY, IS THERE A

01:28:55 SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STARTING TO CUT IN

01:28:58 SEPTEMBER VERSUS DECEMBER? CHAIR POWELL:

01:29:03 WE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO DO WHAT WE THINK THE RIGHT THING FOR

01:29:06 THE ECONOMY IS WHEN WE COME TO THAT CONSENSUS VIEW THAT AS A

01:29:09 RIGHT THING TO DO FOR THE ECONOMY. THAT IS WHAT WE DO.

01:29:12 WE ARE NOT LOOKING AT ANYTHING ELSE.

01:29:14 IT IS HARD ENOUGH TO GET THE ECONOMICS RIGHT.

01:29:19 THESE ARE DIFFICULT THINGS AND IF WE WERE TO TAKE ON A WHOLE

01:29:21 OTHER SET OF FACTORS AND USE THAT AS A NEW FILTER, IT WOULD

01:29:26 REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD WE GET THE ECONOMICS RIGHT.

01:29:28 THAT IS HOW WE THINK ABOUT IT AROUND HERE.

01:29:31 WE KNOW WE WILL DO WHAT THEY THINK IS THE RIGHT THING WHEN

01:29:33 THEY THINK IT IS THE RIGHT THING.

01:29:37 THAT IS HOW EVERYBODY AROUND HERE THINKS.

01:29:39 I CANNOT SAY IT ENOUGH. WE JUST DON'T GO DOWN THAT ROAD.

01:29:43 WHERE DO YOU STOP? WE ARE NOT ON THAT ROAD.

01:29:47 WE ARE ON THE ROAD WE ARE WE ARE SERVING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

01:29:49 AND MAKING OUR DECISIONS BASED ON THE DATA AND HOW THAT DATA

01:29:53 AFFECTS THE OUTLOOK AND THE BALANCE OF RISKS.

01:29:58 >> IS THERE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHETHER YOU

01:30:01 START AND SAY SEPTEMBER VERSUS DECEMBER? CHAIR POWELL:

01:30:05 THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN

01:30:09 INSTITUTION THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT ALL SORTS OF POLITICAL

01:30:11 EVENTS AND ONE THAT DOESN'T. THAT IS WHERE THE SIGNIFICANT

01:30:13 DIFFERENCES. WE JUST DON'T DO THAT.

01:30:18 YOU CAN GO BACK AND READ THE TRANSCRIPTS.

01:30:23 THIS IS MY FOURTH ELECTION, FOURTH PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.

01:30:26 READ ALL THE TRANSCRIPTS AND SEE IF ANYBODY MENTIONS IN ANY

01:30:29 WAY THE PENDING ELECTION. IT IS NOT PART OF OUR THINKING.

01:30:33 IT IS NOT WHAT WE ARE HIRED TO DO. IF WE START AT THAT ROAD, I

01:30:36 DON'T KNOW HOW YOU STOP.

01:30:42 >> THANK YOU. QUESTION ABOUT THE LABOR MARKET.

01:30:46 YOU MENTIONED A FEW TIMES AT THE. LABOR MARKET IS NORMALIZING

01:30:49 TODAY'S DATA SUGGEST THAT THINGS ARE GETTING BACK TO

01:30:51 PRE-PANDEMIC LEVELS. ONE THING THAT HAS NOT

01:30:55 NORMALIZED HIS WAGE GROWTH WHICH IS QUITE A BIT STRONGER

01:30:57 THAN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. CAN YOU SHARE YOUR ANALYSIS OF

01:31:00 WHY THAT'S HAPPENING? IS IT A LAGGING INDICATOR OR

01:31:03 SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON? CHAIR POWELL:

01:31:07 IF YOU GO BACK TO WHERE WAGES PEAKED, WAGE INCREASES PEAKED

01:31:12 THREE YEARS AGO, ESSENTIALLY ALL WAGE MEASURES HAVE COME

01:31:15 DOWN SUSTAINED CHILLY -- SUBSTANTIALLY TO THAT BUT NOT

01:31:17 DOWN TO WHERE THEY WERE BEFORE THE PANDEMIC.

01:31:20 THEY ARE STILL ROUGHLY A PERCENTAGE POINT HIGHER.

01:31:23 WE HAVE SEEN PRETTY CONSISTENT PROGRESS BUT NOT UNIFORMLY.

01:31:28 THE ECI READING FROM TUESDAY WAS EXPECTED TO BE -- TO HAVE

01:31:34 COME DOWN AND IT WAS FLAT YEAR-OVER-YEAR ESSENTIALLY.

01:31:38 THAT PART OF IT IS BUMPY.

01:31:44 WE DON'T TARGET WAGE INCREASES, BUT IN THE LONGER RUN, IF YOU

01:31:53 HAVE WAGE INCREASES RUNNING HIGHER THAN PRODUCTIVITY WOULD

01:31:58 WARRANT, THEN THERE WOULD BE INFLATIONARY PRESSURES.

01:32:01 EMPLOYERS WILL RAISE PRICES OVER TIME IF THAT'S THE CASE.

01:32:03 WE HAVE SEEN PROGRESS. IT HAS BEEN INCONSISTENT BUT WE

01:32:08 HAVE SEEN A SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE OVERALL.

01:32:10 WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO ON THAT.

01:32:19 >> SCOTT. NANCY, SORRY.

01:32:33 >> YOU MENTIONED CONSUMERS AND CONSUMERS ARE FEELING THE

01:32:36 WEIGHT OF INTEREST RATES RIGHT NOW. MOCHAS RATES ARE UP, AS OUR

01:32:39 RATES FOR CAR LOANS, CREDIT CARDS, PEOPLE LOOKING TO BORROW

01:32:40 ARE VERY DISCOURAGED. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THEM?

01:32:45 CHAIR POWELL:, THE THING THAT HURTS EVERYBODY,

01:32:49 PARTICULARLY PEOPLE IN THE LOWER INCOME BRACKETS IS

01:32:51 INFLATION. IF YOU ARE PERSON WHO'S LIVING

01:32:56 PAYCHECK-TO-PAYCHECK AND SUDDENLY, ALL THE THINGS YOU

01:32:59 BUY, THE FUNDAMENTALS OF LIFE GO UP IN PRICE, YOU ARE IN

01:33:02 TROUBLE RIGHT AWAY. WITH THOSE PEOPLE IN MIND IN

01:33:08 PARTICULAR, WHAT WE ARE DOING IS USING OUR TOOLS TO BRING

01:33:09 DOWN INFLATION. IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME BUT WE

01:33:13 WILL SUCCEED AND BRING INFLATION BACK DOWN TO 2% AND

01:33:16 PEOPLE WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT AGAIN.

01:33:17 THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING. WE KNOW IT IS PAINFUL AND

01:33:21 INCONVENIENT BUT THE DIVIDENDS WILL BE PAID, WILL BE VERY

01:33:25 LARGE AND EVERYONE WILL SHARE IN THOSE DIVIDENDS.

01:33:28 WE'VE MADE QUITE A LOT OF PROGRESS IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

01:33:35 I THINK HEADLINE CORE PCE PEAKED AT 5.8%.

01:33:40 HEADLINE PEAKED AT 7.1% AND NOW AT 2.7%.

01:33:42 DON'T WANT TO GET THAT WRONG.

01:33:47 >> ARE CURRENT INTEREST RATES REALLY DOING THAT MUCH TO FIGHT

01:33:49 INFLATION FOR THOSE CONSUMERS? CHAIR POWELL: YES.

01:33:55 I THINK THAT RESTRICTIVE MONETARY POLICY IS DOING WHAT

01:33:57 IT IS SUPPOSED TO DO BUT IT'S ALSO IN THIS CASE UNUSUALLY

01:34:02 WORKING ALONGSIDE AND WITH THE HEALING OF THE SUPPLY-SIDE.

01:34:05 IT WAS DIFFERENT THIS TIME, A BIG PART OF THE SOURCE OF THE

01:34:10 INFLATION AND THE REASON WHY I WE ARE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION

01:34:14 IS WE HAVE THIS SUPPLY-SIDE COLLAPSE WITH SHORTAGES AND

01:34:16 BOTTLENECKS IN ALL THAT KIND OF THING.

01:34:21 THIS HAS TO DO WITH SHUTTING DOWN AND REOPENING OF THE

01:34:25 ECONOMY AND OTHER THINGS THAT REALLY RAISED DEMAND.

01:34:27 MANY FACTORS DID THAT. NOW YOU SEE THOSE TWO THINGS

01:34:34 WORKING TOGETHER, THE REVERSAL OF THOSE SUPPLY AND DEMAND

01:34:36 DISTORTIONS FROM THE PANDEMIC AND A RESPONSE TO IT, ALONG

01:34:39 WITH RESTRICTIVE MONETARY POLICY.

01:34:41 THOSE THINGS ARE WORKING TO BRING DOWN INFLATION AND WE

01:34:44 MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS. REMEMBER HOW FAR WE'VE COME.

01:34:50 WE ARE NOT LOOKING AT THE VERY HIGH INFLATION RATES WE WERE

01:34:52 SEEING TWO YEARS AGO.

01:35:00 >> THANK YOU FOR TAKING OUR QUESTIONS.

01:35:02 I WANTED TO FOLLOW-UP UP ON SOMETHING YOU MENTIONED EARLIER

01:35:05 ON HOUSING INFLATION. THERE HAS BEEN HIS LONG-AWAITED

01:35:10 DISINFLATION AND SHELTER THAT STILL HAS NOT ARRIVED.

01:35:13 TWO QUESTIONS. HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THE

01:35:18 SUBSTANTIAL LAG BETWEEN OTHER PRIVATE-SECTOR DATA WE ARE

01:35:20 SEEING AND THE GOVERNMENT DATA? AND HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU THAT

01:35:25 RENTS WILL BE HELPFUL IN THE INFLATION FRONT IN THE COMING

01:35:26 MONTHS? CHAIR POWELL:

01:35:32 ESSENTIALLY, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PLACES IN THE ECONOMY WHERE

01:35:36 THERE ARE JUST LAG STRUCTURES BUILT INTO THE INFLATION

01:35:38 PROCESS AND HOUSING IS ONE OF THEM.

01:35:44 WHEN SOMEONE GOES -- A NEW PERSON GOES TO RENT AN

01:35:49 APARTMENT, THAT IS MARKET RENT AND MARKET RENTS ARE GOING UP

01:35:51 FAIRLY. THE INFLATION HAS BEEN VERY LOW.

01:35:57 BEFORE THAT, THEY WERE INCREDIBLY HIGH.

01:36:01 THEY LED THE HIGH PART. WHAT HAPPENS IS THOSE MARKET

01:36:08 RATES TAKE YEARS TO GET ALL THE WAY INTO RENTS FOR TENANTS WHO

01:36:12 ARE ROLLING OVER THEIR LEASES. LANDLORDS DON'T TEND TO CHARGE

01:36:18 AS MUCH OF AN INCREASE TO A ROLLOVER TENANT FOR WHATEVER

01:36:19 REASON. WHAT THAT DOES IS IT BUILDS UP

01:36:24 A SORT OF UNREALIZED PORTION OF INCREASES WHEN THERE HAVE BEEN

01:36:25 BIG INCREASES. WHAT HAPPENS IS IT IS

01:36:29 COMPLICATED BUT IT TAKES SOME TIME FOR THAT TO GET IN.

01:36:35 I'M CONFIDENT THAT AS LONG AS MARKET RATES REMAIN LOW, THIS

01:36:39 WILL SHOW UP IN MEASURED INFLATION, ASSUMING THAT MARKET

01:36:42 RATES DO REMAIN LOW. WHAT WILL BE THE EXACT TIMING

01:36:46 OF IT, WE HAVE LEARNED THE LEGS ARE LONGER.

01:36:48 SIGNIFICANT LONGER THAN WE THOUGHT AT THE BEGINNING.

01:36:53 CONFIDENT IT WILL COME BUT NOT SO CONFIDENT IN THE TIMING OF

01:36:54 IT. YES, I EXPECT THAT THIS WILL HAPPEN.

01:37:02 >> THANK YOU FOR TAKING QUESTIONS.

01:37:07 IT SEEMS THAT OVER THE PAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS, ECONOMIES

01:37:12 AND CENTRAL BANKS IN DEVELOPED MARKETS HAVE BEEN ON MORE OR

01:37:14 LESS THE SAME TRAJECTORY. EASING DURING THE PANDEMIC,

01:37:17 FIGHTING INFLATION WITH RESTRICTIVE POLICY ON THE WAY

01:37:18 OUT. IT FEELS LIKE THAT MAY BE ENDING IN 2024 BASED ON

01:37:24 ECONOMIC DATA FROM EUROPE, JAPAN AND THE U.S..

01:37:28 WHAT CONSIDERATIONS OR RISKS DOES A PERIOD OF MORE DIVERSION

01:37:34 GLOBAL ECONOMIC TRAJECTORIES AND CENTRAL BANK POLICIES

01:37:35 PRESENT FOR THE FOMC? CHAIR POWELL:

01:37:39 YOU ARE RIGHT, I THINK THAT MAY HAPPEN.

01:37:42 WE ALL SERVE DOMESTIC MANDATES. I THINK THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

01:37:47 THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ARE NOW

01:37:51 CONSIDERING RATE CUTS IS THEY ARE NOT HAVING THE KIND OF

01:37:52 GROWTH WE ARE HAVING. THEY HAVE THEIR INFLATION

01:37:58 PERFORMING ABOUT LIKE OURS OR MAYBE A LITTLE BETTER BUT THEY

01:38:00 ARE NOT EXPERIENCING THE KIND OF GROWTH WE ARE.

01:38:03 WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE LUXURY OF HAVING STRONG GROWTH AND A

01:38:07 STRONG LABOR MARKET, VERY LOW UNEMPLOYMENT, HIGH JOB CREATION

01:38:10 AND ALL THAT. WE CAN BE PATIENT AND WE WILL

01:38:13 BE CAREFUL AND CAUTIOUS AS WE APPROACH THE DECISION TO CUT

01:38:14 RATES. I THINK OTHER JURISDICTIONS MAY

01:38:17 GO FOR THAT.

01:38:23 IN TERMS OF THE IMPLICATIONS, I THINK OBVIOUSLY MARKETS SEE IT

01:38:24 COMING. IT IS PRICED IN NOW.

01:38:30 I THINK MARKETS AND ECONOMIES CAN ADAPT TO IT.

01:38:35 I THINK WE HAVE NOT SEEN IN ADDITION FOR THE EMERGING

01:38:37 MARKET ECONOMIES, WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE KIND OF TURMOIL THAT

01:38:40 WAS MORE FREQUENT 20 YEARS AGO, 30 YEARS AGO.

01:38:45 THAT IS PARTLY BECAUSE EMERGING MARKET COUNTRIES HAVE MUCH

01:38:50 BETTER POLICY FRAMEWORKS AND BETTER CREDIBILITY ON INFLATION

01:38:51 SO THEY ARE NAVIGATING THIS PRETTY WELL THIS TIME.

01:38:55 >> JENNIFER.

01:38:57 >> THANK YOU.

01:39:03 YOU SORT OF BACKED AWAY FROM THE NOTION THAT THE ECONOMY

01:39:07 WOULD NEED TO ENCOUNTER PAIN FOR INFLATION TO COME BACK DOWN.

01:39:11 GIVEN THE STICKY INFLATION DATA IN THE FIRST QUARTER, CAN

01:39:15 DISINFLATION STILL HAPPEN ALONG RELATIVELY PAINLESS PATH FOR

01:39:17 THE ECONOMY? OR IS SOME SOFTENING IN THE

01:39:22 LABOR MARKET AND THE ECONOMY LIKELY NEEDED TO BRING

01:39:23 INFLATION BACK DOWN? CHAIR POWELL: YOU ARE RIGHT.

01:39:28 I THINK WE THOUGHT AND MOST PEOPLE THOUGHT THERE WOULD HAVE

01:39:34 TO BE PROBABLY SIGNIFICANT DISLOCATIONS SOMEWHERE IN THE

01:39:38 ECONOMY, PERHAPS THE LABOR MARKET TO GET INFLATION DOWN

01:39:39 FROM THE VERY HIGH LEVELS IT WAS OUT OF THE BEGINNING OF

01:39:40 THIS EPISODE. THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

01:39:43 THAT IS IT FROM IT AS RESULT AND WE ARE PLEASED IT DIDN'T

01:39:49 HAPPEN. IF YOU LOOK AT THE DYNAMICS

01:39:52 THAT ENABLED THAT, IT WAS THAT SO MUCH OF THE GAME WAS FROM

01:39:57 THE UNWINDING OF THINGS THAT WEREN'T TO DO WITH THE MONETARY

01:39:59 POLICY BUT THE DISTORTIONS TO THE ECONOMY, SUPPLY-SIDE

01:40:04 PROBLEMS AND SOME DEMAND ISSUES AS WELL.

01:40:07 THE UNWINDING OF THOSE REALLY HELPED INFLATION COME DOWN.

01:40:10 AS I SAID, I AM NOT GIVING UP ON THAT.

01:40:14 I THINK IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THOSE FORCES WILL STILL WORK TO

01:40:17 HELP US BRING INFLATION DOWN. WE CANNOT BE GUARANTEED THAT IS

01:40:21 TRUE. WE ARE TRYING TO USE OUR TOOLS

01:40:27 IN A WAY THAT KEEPS THE LABOR MARKET STRONG AND THE ECONOMY

01:40:30 STRONG BUT ALSO HELPS BRING INFLATION BACK DOWN TO 2%

01:40:31 SUSTAINABLY. WE WILL BRING INFLATION DOWN TO

01:40:35 2% SUSTAINABLY. WE HOPE WE CAN DO IT WITHOUT

01:40:40 SIGNIFICANT DISLOCATIONS IN THE LABOR MARKET.

01:40:43 >> SPEAKING OF DISLOCATIONS IN THE LABOR MARKET, IN TERMS OF

01:40:46 CUTTING, YOU SAID IF THERE WAS WEAKNESS IN THE JOB MARKET,

01:40:48 THAT COULD BE A REASON TO CUT RATES.

01:40:51 IF THE UNAPPOINTED RATE TO GO ABOVE OR PERCENT BUT INFLATION

01:40:55 BACK DOWN TO 2%, HOW WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT?

01:40:58 WITH THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE GOING BACK ABOVE 4% CATCH YOUR

01:41:02 ATTENTION? CHAIR POWELL: I SAID UNEXPECTED WEAKENING IS

01:41:06 THE WAY I CHARACTERIZED IT. I WILL NOT TRY TO DEFINE WHAT I

01:41:11 MEAN BY THAT BUT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE MEANINGFUL AND GET OUR

01:41:15 ATTENTION AND LEAD US TO THINK THE LABOR MARKET WAS

01:41:18 SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKENING FOR US TO WANT TO REACT TO IT.

01:41:25 IT WOULD BE A BROADER THING THAT WOULD SUGGEST THAT IT

01:41:30 WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO CONSIDER CUTTING.

01:41:33 I THINK WHETHER YOU DECIDE TO CUT WILL DEPEND ON ALL THE

01:41:36 FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, NOT JUST THAT ONE.

01:41:42 >> THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE QUESTION.

01:41:47 YOU HAVE SAID THAT BROADER MATERIAL CHANGES ARE NEEDED FOR

01:41:50 THE ENDGAME PROPOSAL. YOU HAVE MENTIONED THAT A

01:41:54 RE-PROPOSAL IS SOMETHING THAT'S ON THE TABLE.

01:41:58 AS YOU HAD MORE TIME TO SIT WITH THE PUBLIC COMMENTARY

01:42:01 PROCESS AND UNDERSTANDING THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO YOU, DO

01:42:03 YOU HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF WHETHER A REPROPOSAL WILL BE

01:42:05 NECESSARY AND YOU HAVE A TIMELINE IN MIND FOR WHEN SOME

01:42:09 SORT OF MOVEMENT WILL BE MADE ON THAT FRONT?

01:42:16 CHAIR POWELL: LET ME START BY SAYING THAT THE

01:42:21 FED IS COMMITTED TO COMPLETING THIS PROCESS AND CARRYING OUT

01:42:26 THE ENDGAME IN A WAY THAT IS FEASIBLE AND COMPARABLE TO WHAT

01:42:30 THE OTHER JURISDICTIONS ARE DOING.

01:42:35 WE HAVE NOT MADE ANY DECISIONS ON POLICY OR ON PROCESS AT ALL.

01:42:38 NO DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE. I WILL SAY IF WE CONCLUDE THAT

01:42:44 REPROPOSAL IS APPROPRIATE, WE WILL NOT HESITATE TO INSIST ON

01:42:45 THAT.

01:42:50 >> DO NEED TO RESOLVE ISSUES WITH A CAPITAL PROPOSAL IN

01:42:54 ORDER TO ADVANCE OTHER PARTS OF THE REVELATORY AGENDA OR DO YOU

01:42:58 ASK PECK TO CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS ON THOSE OTHER AGENDA

01:43:03 ITEMS? CHAIR POWELL: THERE'S NO MECHANICAL RULE IN

01:43:06 PLACE BUT I WOULD SAY THE PROCESS IS BY FAR THE MOST

01:43:10 IMPORTANT THING AND REALLY IS OCCUPYING US AT THIS TIME IN

01:43:13 TERMS OF WHAT WE ARE MOVING AHEAD WITH.

01:43:17 >> LAST QUESTION.

01:43:20 >> THANK YOU. MR. CHAIRMAN, WHAT CAN YOU TELL

01:43:26 US ABOUT THE APPROACH THAT YOU TAKE WITH YOUR ROLE IN THE

01:43:29 SENSE OF TRYING TO ACHIEVE CONSENSUS?

01:43:33 WHAT YOU RECENTLY IDENTIFIED AS A PRIORITY, WHILE ALLOWING FOR

01:43:37 A RANGE OF VIEWS OR EVEN DISSENT.

01:43:40 WE DON'T SEE MANY DISSENTING VOTES IN THE OFFICIAL

01:43:42 STATEMENTS EVEN WHEN MORE SPIRITED DISCUSSIONS ARE NOTED

01:43:44 IN THE MINUTES AFTER THE FACT. HOW DO YOU AVOID GROUPTHINK AND

01:43:50 AVOID A HIGHER RISK OF A POLICY MISTAKE? CHAIR POWELL:

01:43:57 I THINK IF YOU LISTEN TO MY 18 COLLEAGUES ON THE FOMC, YOU

01:44:00 WILL SEE WE DO NOT LACK FOR A DIVERSITY OF VOICES AND

01:44:02 PERSPECTIVES. WE REALLY DON'T. IT IS ONE OF THE GREAT ASPECTS

01:44:06 OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM. WE HAVE 12 RESERVE BANKS AROUND

01:44:10 THE COUNTRY WHERE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN ECONOMIC STAFF, NOT

01:44:13 THE PEOPLE WHO WORK AT THE BOARD. DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

01:44:20 EACH RESERVE BANK HAS ITS OWN CULTURE AROUND MONETARY POLICY

01:44:21 AND ITS OWN APPROACH. IT GUARANTEES YOU A DIVERSITY

01:44:25 OF PERSPECTIVES. I THINK PERSPECTIVES ARE VERY

01:44:33 DIVERSE AND IN TERMS OF DISSENTS , WE HAVE DISSENTS AND

01:44:39 A THOUGHTFUL DISSENT IS A GOOD THING.

01:44:42 IF SOMEONE REALLY MAKES YOU THINK, THAT KIND OF THING BUT

01:44:46 ALL I CAN SAY FROM MY STANDPOINT IS I TRY TO LISTEN

01:44:47 CAREFULLY TO PEOPLE. I TRY TO INCORPORATE THEIR

01:44:51 THINKING, DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO INCORPORATE THEIR THINKING

01:44:55 INTO WHAT WE ARE DOING. I THINK MANY PEOPLE FEEL IF

01:45:00 THAT'S HAPPENING, FOR MOST PEOPLE, THAT WILL BE ENOUGH.

01:45:08 IT IS NOT FROWNED UPON OR ILLEGAL OR AGAINST THE RULES OR

01:45:09 ANYTHING LIKE THAT. AND J
