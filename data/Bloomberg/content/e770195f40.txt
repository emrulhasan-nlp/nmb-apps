00:40 >> INFLATION IS NOT DOING WHAT THEY WANT IN THIS PROBLEM FOR

00:41 THEM.

00:46 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE WITH JONATHAN

00:49 FERRO, LISA ABRAMOWICZ, AND AN RECORDER. JONATHAN:

00:55 ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE YOU TO A NEW POND MARKET BOARD.

00:58 THINGS HAVE CHANGED, WE HAVE DIFFERENT NUMBERS.

01:02 NEW HIGHS FOR 2024. THE TWO YOU'RE GETTING CLOSER

01:08 TO 5% -- TWO YEAR. THE QUOTE OF THE LAST 24 HOURS

01:15 AROUND THIS DESK, JP MORGAN'S DAVID KELLEY, THE SOUND OF

01:19 THEIR SLINGSHOT ON A JUNE CUT.

01:25 LISA: STEPHEN OF STANDARD CHARTING,

01:30 RBC, WE ARE CHANGING OUR FED CALL FROM 45 BASIS POINTS TO

01:34 ONE OF A DUTY FIVE BASIS POINT MOVE.

01:37 YESTERDAY WE SAW THE BIGGEST SELF, THE BIGGEST YIELDS SINCE

01:40 2022 AND IT SEEMS THERE MIGHT BE MORE. ANNMARIE:

01:43 EVERYONE IS TRYING TO REVISE. -- STARTING TO REVISE.

01:47 THIS REALLY SEALS THE FATE FOR THE JUNE FOMC TO PUSH THIS

01:53 FURTHER BACK. IF WE CAME INTO THIS YEAR

01:58 EXPECTING WHEN WILL THE FED CUT, AND THAT IS A MATTER OF

02:02 SOME PEOPLE ASKING IF THE FED WILL HAVE A CUT IN 2022 -- IN

02:05 2024. JONATHAN:

02:13 TWO BIG HEADLINES CROSSING BLOOMBERG EARLIER, TRIGGERS

02:14 PARENTING RATE CUTLETS TO LESS THAN 25 BASIS POINTS.

02:22 LOOK AT FOR EXCHANGE, THE EURO, 1.07.

02:24 THE DOLLAR HAVING ITS BIGGEST ONE-DAY SINCE THE BANKING

02:27 STRESS OF LAST SPRING. DOLLAR, 152.

02:34 NEVER MIND, IT IS 153. LISA:

02:40 HOW MUCH DOES THE HOT CPI CAUSE THE HAND OF THE LIKES OF THE

02:42 ECB AND THE BANK OF JAPAN? HOW DIFFERENT IS INFLATION IN

02:45 THE U.S. DIFFERENT THAN ELSEWHERE?

02:48 IS THE UPAS STILL EXCEPTIONAL -- IS THE U.S.

02:53 STILL EXCEPTIONAL? CUTTING BECAUSE THEIR CURRENCY

02:57 IS WEAKENING. JONATHAN: HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE ECB AND

03:02 8:15, 15 MINUTES AFTER THAT WE WOULD GET JOBLESS CLAIMS AND

03:08 PPI.

03:09 15 MINUTES AFTER THAT, NEW YORK FED PRESIDENT JOHN WILLIAMS,

03:12 HOW IS HE GOING TO RESPOND TO THE DATA? LISA:

03:15 WE DID HEAR FROM TWO FED PRESIDENTS YESTERDAY, AUSTAN

03:18 GOOLSBEE WHO HAD SOMETHING INTERESTING TO SAY.

03:23 BOTH OF THEM DID NOT SEEM READY TO WHOLESALE RESET THEIR

03:26 EXPECTATIONS FOR A REACH CUT -- FOR A RATE CUT.

03:28 AUSTAN GOOLSBEE SAYING THEY ARE WORSE WHEN IT COMES TO

03:32 CONVERSION READS. WE ARE GETTING TO THE POINT

03:35 WHEN THERE WILL BE MORE TRADE-OFFS THAN LAST YEAR.

03:39 NOT READY TO TAKE A RATE CUT OF THE TABLE BUT ALLOWING

03:43 INFLATION IS GOING TO HAVE TO RUN HARDER TO CATER TO THE

03:48 POCKETS OF WE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE ECONOMY. ANNMARIE:

03:52 THE OTHER FED OFFICIAL SAID YOU HAVE TO STAY HUMBLE WITH THIS

03:53 ENVIRONMENT AND THE STATEMENT. PALMETTO ARIAN WITH A PIECE

03:59 SOLIDIFYING SOMETHING HE TALKED ABOUT WHICH IS THE THE FED IN

04:04 ORDER TO REMAIN -- NEEDS TO ACCEPT 2% TO 3% INFLATION.

04:07 IF THEY DON'T, THEY HAVE THE POTENTIAL OF BERNANKE GAINS IN

04:10 THE ECONOMY. JONATHAN: EQUITY FUTURES ON THE S&P 500,

04:14 BOTTOM TO THE KORAN. EQUITY FUTURES NEGATIVE.

04:23 SO MUCH FOR THE GREAT ROTATION -- GRAND ROTATION.

04:28 WITHIN THE EQUITY MARKET ON THE S&P 500, EQUAL WEIGHT VERSUS

04:29 MARKET CAP WEIGHT. OUTPERFORMING ANY THE FACE OF

04:32 MUCH HIGHER YIELDS. THE NEXT SEVEN, NVIDIA POSITIVE

04:36 YESTERDAY. THIS WAS BRUTAL. LISA:

04:42 REMEMBER WHEN THIS WAS THE RATE SENSITIVE TRADE AND NOW IT IS

04:43 THE RATE INSENSITIVE TRADE? PEOPLE ARE CONFUSED.

04:46 HOW DO YOU PLAY ANY INFLATION STORY THAT SEEMS STICKIER THAN

04:51 YESTERDAY? AT THE SAME TIME WHEN YOU HAVE

04:55 COMPANIES THAT FEEL WEAKNESS AND CURLY PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT

04:58 IS JUST NVIDIA. JONATHAN: COMING UP, GEORGE GONCALVES

05:03 FOLLOWING THE MARKET SELLOFF. STEVEN COOK ON RISING TENSIONS

05:06 BETWEEN ISRAEL AND IRAN.

05:13 DAVID COLE EXPLAINING WHY THE ECB MAY DELIVER A SURPRISE CUT.

05:18 GLOBAL BONDS SELLING OFF AS INVESTORS/EXPECTATIONS --

05:21 INVESTORS SLASH EXPECTATIONS FOR A RATE CUT. CPI IS NOT CP.

05:31 THE INFLATION TRAJECTORY AT THE CURRENT PACE IS ANY ISSUE FOR

05:32 THE FED. GEORGE IS WITH US NOW.

05:38 THE DATA YESTERDAY, DO YOU BELIEVE OR NOT TO BED THE IDEA

05:42 THAT WE ARE GOING TO GET A RATE CUT ANYTIME SOON? GEORGE:

05:48 I THINK IT DOES PUSH IT OFF AND THAT IS WHAT WE'RE SEEING

05:49 ACROSS ALL FORECASTERS. THIS IS THE CHALLENGE.

05:55 ONCE YOU GET TO A POINT WHERE THE MARKET IS UNDERPRICING WHAT

05:58 THE FED HAS, IT DOES CALL INTO QUESTION THE TIMING.

06:01 TIMING IS CRITICAL.

06:07 IF THE DATA HAS PUSHED OFF, THE ELECTION SHOULDN'T PLAY A ROLE.

06:15 I THINK THEY SHOULD CUT IN JULY. I'M NOT GOING TO CHANGE THAT

06:18 PART OF THE VIEW.

06:24 THEY THINK YESTERDAY WAS ANY OVERREACTION -- I THINK

06:25 YESTERDAY WAS AN OVERREACTION.

06:31 WE HAVE THIS UNSYNCHRONIZED EASING AND THE FED IS DELAYED.

06:33 OTHER CENTRAL BANKS WILL BE WORRIED.

06:38 THIS DOES ADD TO VOLATILITY IS IN THE 10 YEAR MORE THAN THE

06:39 TWO. JONATHAN: THE WORD OVERREACTION, WANT TO

06:42 GET INTO THAT. DO YOU THINK ANY UPSIDE

06:50 SURPRISE OF SIX BASIS POINTS WAS WORTH A 20 BASIS POINT MOVE

06:52 AT THE FRONT END OF THE CURVE? GEORGE:

06:58 THAT GOES TO SHOW HOW LIKE OF CONVICTION THAT IS IN THE

07:00 MARKETPLACE AND OUTFLOWS CAN CHANGE QUICKLY.

07:04 WHEN YOU ARE ON HOLD AND DATA DEPENDENT, BOTH CONSENT THE

07:07 FED, IT IS GOING TO CAUSE THESE SORTS OF REACTIONS. LISA:

07:12 JEANMARIE DID PUT IT WELL FROM BUTCHERED BANK, THIS CALLS INTO

07:15 QUESTION IF THE BOND WITH IS A BOND.

07:18 AT WHAT POINT DOES IT BECOME A TREND?

07:21 FROM ALL OF THE NODES, IT SEEMS PEOPLE ARE SAYING THIS IS

07:26 STICKY AND IF YOU DISCOUNT THAT, THAT IS GOING TO BE AT

07:31 YOUR PERIL. WHY ARE YOU DISCOUNTING THAT?

07:34 GEORGE: STICKY VERSUS CRITICAL INFLATION IS.

07:39 WE HAVE A LONG AHEAD OF US WITH A LOT OF THINGS THAT CAN CHANGE

07:42 ON BOTH THE GROWTH SIDE VERSUS THE INFLATION SIDE.

07:47 TO ONLY FOCUS ON EFFICIENT FEAR COULD CALL INTO QUESTION -- THE

07:52 OP-ED FROM MOHAMED EL-ERIAN IS A GOOD ONE.

07:59 WE COULD BE TRADING 2% TO 3% ON INFLATION AND TO JEOPARDIZE

08:02 GROWTH UNTIL THE FED WILL SEE THE IMPROVEMENT OR WEAKNESS IN

08:05 THE ECONOMY, AT THAT POINT IT IS TOO LATE.

08:11 WE TALKED ABOUT THE DRAMATIC MOVES IN THE TREASURY MARKET.

08:16 IN THE CURRENCY MARKET, WE SAW THE BIGGEST ONE-DAY RALLY IN

08:19 THE DOLLAR GOING BACK TO THE HEIGHT OF THE MAKING CRISIS IN

08:22 MARCH 2023. HOW MUCH PRODUCING THIS IS THE

08:28 DIFFICULTY AND CHALLENGE TO SYNCHRONIZE RATE CUTTING CYCLE

08:29 GLOBALLY? GEORGE: IT COMES DOWN TO THE FX MARKETS.

08:41 WE LOOK WHAT IS GOING ON WITH DOLLAR-YEN, THIS GETS INTO A

08:42 VICIOUS CYCLE. THAT IS WHY THE 10 YEAR, THE

08:47 DOLLAR, AND WILL ARE CRITICAL. THAT TRIO IS WHAT IS GOING TO

08:50 DICTATE WHAT WAS FORWARD.

08:56 WE HAD A FINANCIALLY USING ACCOMMODATIVE ENVIRONMENT.

08:59 IF THOSE BURIALS START USING, YOU WILL GET TIGHTENING THERE.

09:03 ALL OF THIS STUFF IS IN PLAY. JONATHAN: THE EURO, 1.07.

09:09 THAT MOVE IN YIELDS AND IN RATES STATESIDE, WHO DOES THAT

09:14 UPSET MORE? BANK OF ENGLAND, DOJ -- BOJ, OR

09:19 ECB? GEORGE:

09:28 BOJ FIRST COME ECB SECOND, BOE THIRD.

09:35 WE HAVE LOOKED AT THE ECB AS MAKING POLICY MISTAKES.

09:38 I THINK THEY ARE TRYING TO DO PROACTIVE.

09:40 I THINK THEY WILL HAVE TO EASE BEFORE THE FED.

09:43 THAT IS A CHALLENGE FOR THEM. TO SIT HERE AND DO NOTHING IS

09:47 NOT THE RIGHT COURSE OF ACTION. JONATHAN:

09:50 DO THINK THERE IS ANY ABILITY TO GO FURTHER BEYOND THE JUNE

09:52 RATE CUT? GEORGE:

09:58 AT A MINIMUM WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN HIS, YOU WANT TO

10:01 BACKPEDAL, THIS COULD ENTER INTO AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE

10:05 CENTRAL BANKS EASE AND SKIP MEETINGS AND TRY TO CALIBRATE

10:06 IN BETWEEN. SLOW DOWN THE PROCESS AND NOT

10:12 CHANGING HER TO EVERY OTHER INFLATION REPORT. JONATHAN:

10:21 152 WAS THE LINE IN THE SAND OF INTERVENTION AND HERE WE ARE

10:22 AT 153. STEVE SAID A HOT PRINT WOULD

10:29 MEAN FIGHTING MARKET FUNDAMENTALS, THAT IS A

10:31 DIFFICULT INTERVENTION PROPOSITION.

10:34 GIVEN WHERE THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE AND HOW STRONG THE TIDE IS

10:39 AGAINST THE BOJ, DO YOU THINK THEY CAN INTERVENE IN THE FX

10:43 MARKET ANYMORE? GEORGE:

10:45 THE CHALLENGE IS FOR THE BETTER PART OF 18 MONTHS AS THE FED

10:50 WAS HIKING AND ALL OF THESE EASES WERE PRESENT IN, IN MANY

10:55 WAYS THE BANK OF JAPAN WAS BANKING ON GLOBAL CENTRAL BANKS

10:59 USING AND THAT WOULD TAKE PRESSURE OFF OF THE CURRENCY.

11:04 THIS DOES CALL INTO QUESTION THAT AND THEREFORE YOU START

11:06 RAISING RATES FASTER AND YOU GET INTO THE YEN TRADE.

11:11 THE JAPAN STORY IS CRITICAL. IT IS IMPORTANT TO US.

11:18 IT DOES AT A MINIMUM NEED TO HAVE SOME SORT OF INTERVENTION.

11:23 I DON'T THINK A MOVIE ON FIVE WILL BE TOLERATED.

11:27 WE DON'T KNOW WITH CLARITY WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

11:33 THEY COULD RAISE RATES EVEN MORE THAN 10 BUSINESS POINTS AT

11:39 A CLIP. LISA:

11:41 DOES YESTERDAY'S PRINT CHALLENGE THIS -- THAT THERE IS

11:43 MORE VALUE ELSEWHERE? WHETHER IT IS RISK ASSETS OR

11:47 CURRENCY, IT SEEMS THE U.S. IS OVERPRICED.

11:49 DOES THAT GETS CHALLENGED FUNDAMENTALLY BASED ON THE FACT

11:52 THAT THE U.S. IS THE ONE PRINTING HOT

11:54 INFLATION? GEORGE:

12:02 IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR VERBAL BOND STREAM, THE U.S.

12:05 IS THE HIGHEST YIELDING FOR DEVELOPED MARKETS.

12:09 NEW ZEALAND AND A FEW OTHERS. THAT IS WHY IT IS HARD FOR

12:13 FIXED INCOME TO GO UNHINGED. THIS 450 LEVEL IS CRITICAL.

12:19 WE COULD GO TO 475. NONE THE LESS, CAPITAL WILL

12:23 COME TO THE U.S. BECAUSE OF HIGHER YIELDS.

12:26 THAT WILL BENEFIT MORE FIXED INCOME THAN EQUITIES. JONATHAN:

12:31 GEORGE GONCALVES, THANK YOU. THE TWO YEAR, 496.

12:39 THE 10 YEAR, 455. WE HAVE TO SIT ON THIS LONGER.

12:44 THERE IS A REASON PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SO CONSTRUCTIVE RISK

12:47 ASSETS THIS YEAR. ONE WAS THIS LEAF THE FED HAD

12:51 THIS SPACE TO RESPOND TO TRUCKS. THE EMPHASIS WAS GOING TO SHIFT

12:56 TOWARDS POTENTIAL WEAKNESS AND AWAY FROM BEING WORRIED ABOUT

12:57 STRENGTH. I WONDER HOW MUCH THAT INFLATION PRINT CHANGES THEIR

13:01 STORY. LISA: IT SEEMS LIKE THE MARKET IS

13:04 SAYING QUITE A BIT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE PRICE AND

13:09 THE SIGNALS, THE BEGINNING OF A NARRATIVE SHIFT.

13:13 A PRETTY MASSIVE NERD TO SHIFT WHERE THE BUMPS IN THE ROAD IS

13:16 SOMETHING RETRACTABLE AND PEOPLE ARE NOT JUST QUESTIONING

13:19 WHEN THE FED IS GOOD TO CUT RATES BUT THERE INCREASING THE

13:23 RATE FOR THEIR STOP AT THIS IS A LONGER-TERM DIVERSIONARY

13:25 STORY PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO GRAPPLE WITH. JONATHAN:

13:33 OF THE PEOPLE LEANING TOWARDS NEUTERING.

13:38 HERE IS YOUR -- LEANING TOWARDS A NEW TREND.

13:45 DANI: THE $14 BILLION DEAL WILL LIKELY BE DELAYED.

13:50 BOTH COMPANIES HOPED THEY WOULD SEE APPROVAL AND IT IS SECOND

13:51 OR THIRD QUARTER THIS YEAR. THIS HAS BECOME A HOT BUTTON

13:54 ISSUE. PRESIDENT BIDEN FOR HIS PART

13:58 CITY WITH U.S. STEEL REMAINED MYSTICALLY OWNED

14:07 BUT DID NOT STOP SHORT OF TRYING TO KILL THE DEAL.

14:09 TOMMY TRUMPS THAT HE WAS ON THE TAKEOVER.

14:14 DIFONZO HAS TOUCHED YOU WHICH -- LAPHONZA HAS TRIED TO REACH

14:18 A DEAL WITH CABIN EMPLOYEES. THIS WOULD GIVE THEM A 16.5%

14:24 WAGE INCREASE AND AN INFLATION COMPENSATION BONUS.

14:30 THE AGREEMENT WILL BE VALID AND PROTECT LUFTHANSA UNTIL 2026.

14:37 NEW YORK CITY AND MIAMI'S RETURN TO OFFICE RATES ARE

14:40 ALMOST 80% AND THE HIGHEST AMONG MAJOR U.S. MARKETS.

14:45 THE DATA COMES FROM -- AND SHOWS WALL STREET IS DRIVING

14:48 THE REBOUND IN MANHATTAN WITH BIG BANKS ENCOURAGING EMPLOYEES

14:51 TO RETURN TO OFFICE. WE CAN THANK J.P.

14:54 MORGAN AND GOLDMAN SACHS. THOSE HAVE BEEN HELPING TO

14:57 DRIVE THE NUMBERS UP. JONATHAN: I AM SURE LOOK OF POLITICIANS

15:01 ARE DRIVING UP TO THANK THEM. LISA: AGGRESSIVELY ENCOURAGED.

15:08 WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE? I ENCOURAGE YOU TO COME BACK TO

15:13 THE OFFICE OR WE WILL AGGRESSIVELY ENTER YOUR DESK.

15:15 JONATHAN: OR ADJUST YOUR BONUS. LISA:

15:17 I GUESS THERE ARE NEXT FEELINGS ABOUT IT BUT THIS IS THE NEW

15:21 NORM. JONATHAN: UP NEXT ON THE PROGRAM, GROWING

15:24 TENSIONS BETWEEN ISRAEL AND IRAN. PRES. BIDEN:

15:31 OUR COMMITMENT TO ISRAEL'S SECURITY AGAINST THESE THREATS

15:34 FROM IRAN AND ITS PROXIES ARE IRONCLAD. JONATHAN:

15:39 THAT CONVERSATION UP NEXT. FROM NEW YORK THIS MORNING,

15:41 GOOD MORNING.

16:51 PRES. BIDEN: WE WANT TO ALSO ADDRESS THE

16:52 IRANIAN THREAT. THEY ARE THREATENING TO LAUNCH

16:55 A SIGNIFICANT ATTACK ON ISRAEL. AS A TOLD PRIME MINISTER

17:04 NETANYAHU, OUR COMMITMENT TO ISRAEL'S SECURITY AGAINST IRAN

17:06 AND ITS PROXIES IS IRONCLAD. WE ARE GOING TO WE CAN TO

17:10 PROTECT ISRAEL'S SECURITY. JONATHAN: THE U.S.

17:15 AND ALLIES WARNING OF A LIMITED ATTACK BY IRAN AND ITS PROXIES.

17:19 IT COULD HAPPEN IN COMING DAYS. STEVEN COOK WRITING THIS.

17:24 "IT HAS BEEN MESSAGING AGAINST IRAN OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF

17:28 ESCALATION. I DON'T THINK BIDEN CAN WORK

17:32 OFF THE IRANIANS.

17:38 THE IRANIANS WOULD LOOK WEAK IF THEY DO NOT RESPOND."

17:44 STEVE IS WITH US -- STEPHEN IS WITH US.

17:47 WE HAVE TALKING ABOUT A MINUTE FOR SOME TIME NOW.

17:51 RETALIATION, WHAT DO YOU THINK IT WOULD LOOK LIKE? STEVEN:

18:01 THERE IS SPECULATION IRAN WOULD ATTACK ISRAEL.

18:05 I THINK THAT IS UNLIKELY SINCE IT WOULD SPOT IN-KIND ON

18:06 IRANIAN TERRITORY. I THINK IS REALLY DIPLOMATIC

18:14 INSTALLATIONS AROUND THE WORLD ARE DEFINITELY IN THE LINE OF

18:16 FIRE.

18:23 NOT TO TWITTER SOMETHING -- NOT TO TORTURE SOMETHING PEOPLE SAY

18:25 ALL THE TIME IN THE MIDDLE EAST, BUT IT IS AN I FOR ANY I.

18:37 -- AN EYE FOR AN EYE.

18:43 ISRAEL ATTACKED AT A DIPLOMATIC INSTALLATION. ANNMARIE:

18:48 IF THEY'RE GOING TO ATTACK A CONSULATE OR ANY OFFICIAL IN A

18:52 FOREIGN COUNTRY, WHAT COUNTRIES WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE TO IRAN TO

18:56 NOT START A FIGHT WITH A FOREIGN COUNTRY? STEVEN:

19:01 I AM CERTAIN THEY WON'T CHOOSE THE U.S.

19:04 AS THE PLACE FOR RETALIATION. EUROPE IS A LIKELY TARGET.

19:12 SOUTH AMERICA IS NOT UNPRECEDENTED.

19:17 IRANIAN AGENCIES ATTACKED A CENTER IN ONE ASSAD WAS--IN

19:21 BUENOS AIRES.

19:27 PATIENT IS A PLACE WHERE IRAN HAS SIGNIFICANT CAPABILITIES

19:30 THROUGH ITS AXIS OF RESISTANCE. THOSE AREAS WOULD NOT EVEN

19:37 ACCEPTABLE TO HOST GOVERNMENTS BUT TAKING A STEP OF TRYING TO

19:41 ATTACK ISRAELIS INTO THE UNITED STATES OR CERTAIN WESTERN

19:44 COUNTRIES WOULD BE A STEP TOO FAR FOR THE IRANIANS. ANNMARIE:

19:48 I HOPE YOU CAN HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED WHEN

19:51 THE IRANIANS CAME OUT AND SAID THEY WERE CLOSING TRAFFIC OVER

19:53 TEHRAN. THEIR NEWS AGENCY REMOVED THE

19:58 REPORT ABOVE CLOSING THAT AIRSPACE.

20:02 WAS THIS SUPPOSED TO SIGNAL THAT THEY WERE POTENTIALLY

20:05 GOING TO HAVE AN ALMOST IMMEDIATE STRIKE? STEVEN:

20:12 THERE IS A FAIR PSYCHOLOGICAL AFFAIR UNDERWEAR --

20:15 PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE UNDERWAY. THIS IS THE SECOND TIME WE HAVE

20:19 BEEN WARNED OF AN IMMINENT ATTACK THAT HAS NOT COME.

20:25 INDEED, THE IRANIANS ARE TRAINED TO KEEP EVERYBODY ON

20:28 THEIR TOES AND SURPRISE THEM. I WOULD PUT THAT IN THE

20:33 CATEGORY OF PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE. LISA:

20:38 YOU ARE SPEAKING FROM DELPHI, GREECE AT THE DELPHI ECONOMIC

20:41 FORUM WHERE YOU HAVE BEEN SPEAKING WITH DIFFERENT LEADERS

20:46 NOT ONLY OF COUNTRIES, BUT LEADERS ECONOMICALLY.

20:48 I AM SURE THEY ARE ASKING YOU HOW BAD IS THIS?

20:52 IS THIS GOING TO PERCOLATE OUT? WHAT CHANCE OF ESCALATION DO

20:54 YOU SEE? WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL

20:58 THEM WHEN THEY TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE ARE LOOKING

20:59 AT? STEVEN: TWO QUESTIONS PEOPLE ARE

21:06 ASKING, ONE IS WILL THE CONFLICT WIDENED?

21:13 MY ANSWER IS THE CONFLICT HAS ALREADY WIDENED.

21:17 IF YOU LOOK AT THE RED SEA, SUED, IN LEBANON AS WELL.

21:21 THEN THEY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE STATES.

21:26 THERE IS A LOWER PROBABILITY ABOUT IRAN AND THE UNITED

21:28 STATES THEN ISRAEL. IF THE IRANIANS CHOOSE TO

21:35 ATTACK AGAINST ISRAEL, THE ESCALATION SPIRAL IS

21:36 SIGNIFICANT. LISA: DO YOU THINK IS BEING PRICED IN

21:43 BY THESE INVESTORS AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE PUSHED INTO THE SIDE

21:45 FOR NOW? STEVEN:

21:51 YOU WOULD KNOW BETTER THAN I IF THEY PRESSED IT IN, BUT THERE

21:55 IS GRAVE CONCERN ABOUT THE

22:01 CONFLICT IN THE MIDDLE EAST INTENSIFYING AND BECOMING

22:05 BEYOND THIS RED SEA THEATER TO A MIDDLE EASTERN THEATER.

22:08 THAT IS WITH THE TOP OF MIND FOR PEOPLE HERE AND I IMAGINE

22:12 ELSEWHERE. JONATHAN: CAN WE FINISH ON IRAN?

22:17 I THINK IRAN HAS BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD.

22:20 THEY ARE VERY CALCULATING, EVERYTHING IS PRECISE.

22:24 CAN YOU TALK TO ME ABOUT HOW MISUNDERSTOOD IRANIAN POLICY

22:25 MIGHT BE? THAT IS NO WAY AN ENDORSEMENT

22:28 OF IRANIAN POLICY. I JUST THINK THEY ARE

22:31 INCREASINGLY UNDERSTOOD. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS? STEVEN:

22:37 I THINK THAT IS RIGHT AND IT IS MISUNDERSTOOD IN WASHINGTON.

22:42 POLICYMAKERS AND ANALYSTS IN WASHINGTON HAVE BELIEVED THERE

22:45 COULD BE A DIFFERENT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP WITH THE IRANIANS

22:49 COME IN MORE CONSTRUCTIVE ONE. RECENT EVENTS HAVE MADE IT

22:54 CLEAR THE IRANIANS DO NOT NECESSARILY SEEK A BETTER

22:56 RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S.. THEY PREFERRED TO PUSH THE U.S.

23:02 OUT OF THE MIDDLE EAST. WHEN IT COMES TO THIS QUESTION OF A

23:04 RESPONSE, I THINK YOU ARE RIGHT. THE IRANIANS ARE MORE

23:10 CALCULATING, THEY WILL TAKE THEIR TIME TO DETERMINE WHERE

23:13 AND WHEN WOULD BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE TO RESPOND TO

23:19 ISRAEL'S STRIKE ON THE ISLAMIC REVOLUTION. JONATHAN:

23:23 THANK YOU FOR MAKING TIME WITH US. CRUDE WAS POSITIVE.

23:31 IT IS NOW NEGATIVE BY .5%. PULLING ON TO 90 ON BRENT.

23:35 ANNMARIE: YOU HAVE TO WATCH THE HEIGHTENED -- WHAT THE

23:42 HEIGHTENED GEOPHYSICAL RISKS COULD MEAN -- GEOPOLITICAL

23:44 RISKS COULD MEAN. THE IRANIANS TAKE THEIR TIME.

23:49 THEY HAVE A LETHAL WAY OF GOING THROUGH THIS.

23:53 THEY TALKED EVERYONE ON THEIR SECURITY COUNCIL BEFORE THEY

23:54 DECIDE WHERE TO GO. I AM LOOKING FOR WHEN THE U.S.

23:59 DEPARTMENT COMES OUT AND SAYS DO NOT TRAVEL TO THIS COUNTRY,

24:04 WHEN IS REALLY AIRSPACE CLOSES, WHEN AIRLINES SAY I'M NOT GOING

24:05 TO FLY OVER THIS AIRSPACE. THAT IS WHEN YOU KNOW

24:07 SOMETHING, IS ON THE WAY. JONATHAN:

24:10 THE LAST THING THIS MORTGAGE NEEDS IS ANOTHER BIG RALLY IN

24:16 CRUDE. THAT IS SURE. SOFTER ON THE MORNING.

24:20 COMING NEXT, VIRGINIE MAISONNEUVE.

24:25 AS S&P 500 ATTEMPTS AND FAILS TO RECOVER FROM YESTERDAY.

24:28 EQUITY FUTURES A LITTLE BIT SOFTER. FROM NEW YORK, THIS IS

24:30 BLOOMBERG.

24:46 JONATHAN: A DELAYED START TO THERAPY, AND

24:51 BY THERAPY I'M IN THE AUGUSTINE INTERNATIONAL.

24:54 I AM GOING TO TALK TO MYSELF THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. LISA:

24:56 I WAS GOING TO SAY THE SAME THING. JONATHAN:

24:59 NO ONE IS INTERESTED WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN AT AUGUSTA

25:01 INTERNATIONAL. EQUITY FUTURES AUGUST BE 500

25:06 DOWN. DOWN ON THE NASDAQ. ON THE RUSSELL, WE ARE NEGATIVE.

25:16 THE UNDERPERFORMANCE YESTERDAY IN THE ROTATION TRADE WAS

25:18 ABSOLUTELY BRUTAL. LARGE VERSUS SMALL, SMOKE GETS

25:23 HAMMERED. PEOPLE OF AGE VERSUS MARKET CAP

25:26 WAIT, PEOPLE WAY TO GET HAMMERED.

25:31 YOU SAW THE MAG7, WHAT IS IT DOING OUTPERFORMING ON A DAY

25:33 WHEN ART OF 20 BASIS POINTS? THAT WAS YESTERDAY. LISA:

25:37 IT POINTS TO CONFUSION.

25:43 THERE WAS THIS IDEA OF STRENGTH SUPPORTING CYCLICAL AREAS,

25:46 THOSE SIN COMPANIES AND CREDIBLY CHALLENGED BY THE IDEA

25:47 THAT INTEREST RATES AREN'T GOING TO GO DOWN BECAUSE THOSE

25:53 TEND TO BE MORE LEVERAGED TO WHERE RATES ARE AT THE MOMENT.

25:59 HE THESE STORIES TOGETHER, I CANNOT THINK OF ANY OTHER

26:03 EXPLANATION THEN IT'S CONFUSION. JONATHAN:

26:08 CPI, BOND MARKET BIG OFF, DOUBLE DIGIT MOVES.

26:12 THE TWO YEAR YIELD WE HAVE TALKING ABOUT 470 AND 4.80 AND

26:18 OVERNIGHT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 5%.

26:21 YIELDS PULLING BACK A TOUCH BY A SINGLE BASIS POINT.

26:24 THE 10 YEAR. IF YOU ARE STICKING WITH JUNE,

26:29 YOU'RE CLINGING TO PPI. JOBLESS CLAIMS, TOO. LISA:

26:34 THE QUESTION ISN'T ARE YOU CUTTING YOUR RATE CALL FOR THIS

26:38 YEAR, IT IS WHY AREN'T YOU CUTTING A RECALL FOR THIS YEAR?

26:41 WHY IS THIS NOT INDICATIVE OF SOMETHING STICKIER?

26:45 THAT IS THE REASON WHY I AM CURIOUS TO SPEAK WITH CITIGROUP

26:49 ECONOMISTS LATER BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES CLINGING TO JUNE

26:52 AND WHAT GIVES THEM THAT SINCE THAT THERE IS ANY OPENING?

26:55 JONATHAN: MIKE OF BANK OF AMERICA HAD

26:57 THIS TO SAY, STILL STICKING WITH JUNE.

27:03 "WE THINK THE UNFAVORABLE BASE AFFECTS ON INFLATION MEAN THE

27:05 FED COULD BE FORCED TO DELAY THE START OF AN EASING CYCLE TO

27:10 THE SYMBOL OF THIS YEAR OR MARCH OF NEXT YEAR.

27:12 THE LONGER YOU WAIT, THE HARDER IT GETS TO START. LISA:

27:15 WHICH IS THE POLITICAL QUESTION. THE REASON THIS IS A FIGHT

27:17 MOMENT. THIS IS A FED THAT WANTS TO BE

27:21 POLITICALLY INDEPENDENT. ANYTHING THEY DO WILL BE

27:26 PERCEIVED AS POLITICAL, ESPECIALLY IF THEY CUT RATES

27:31 INTO INFLATION THAT LOOKS STICKY , AND ECONOMY PRINTING

27:34 JOBS NORTH OF -- A MONTH AND TALKING ABOUT A CLOSE ELECTION.

27:39 THIS IS A DIFFICULT MOMENT FOR A FEDERAL RESERVE THAT WANTS TO

27:40 STAY OUT OF THE FRAY. JONATHAN: LET'S GET TO ON EXCHANGE AT

27:44 OTHER BANKS. THE ECB, 1.0732.

27:49 THE ECB DECISION COMING AT 8:15 WITH PRESIDENT LAGARDE SPEAKING

28:00 AT 8:45. .

28:03 TO CUT IN JUNE IS THE BASE CASE BUT NO LONGER FULLY PRESSED.

28:08 THE CONVERSATION WE STARTED THE HOUR WITH WAS HOW YESTERDAY'S

28:12 NEWS WOULD IMPACT TOMORROW'S MOVES. ANNMARIE:

28:15 IT IS CAUSING HEADACHES IN FRANKFURT AND TOKYO BECAUSE YOU

28:18 SEE THIS WING ON THE CURRENCY PAIRS.

28:22 WHEN IT COMES TO JUNE AND THE ECB, SHOULD THE ECB ALREADY BE

28:23 CUTTING? CHRISTINE LAGARDE SAID IN

28:27 DECEMBER IT IS LIKELY GOING TO BE JUNE.

28:31 WHEN YOU SEE THE CPI PRINT HAPPENING IN THE U.S., HOW

28:34 DIFFICULT DOES IT MAKE THAT DECISION? JONATHAN:

28:39 IN THE NEWS CONFERENCE TODAY, ONE CHALLENGE AND I IMAGINE

28:42 SOMEONE IS GOING TO ASK IT, HOW IMPORTANT IS THE FX CHANNEL TO

28:43 PRESENT STABILITY? -- FX CHANNEL TO PRESS

28:54 STABILITY -- PRICE

29:02 STABILITY. LISA:

29:13 I AM CHECKING THE EURO WEAKENS MORE, PLANE TICKETS TO EUROPE.

29:18 HOW MUCH COULD THIS BE POSITIVE FOR THE NATION BESIDES JUST

29:19 IMPORTING GOODS AT HIGHER PRICES?

29:23 TO ME, YOU HAVE TO THINK IT IS GOING TO BE A BOOST FOR PEOPLE

29:25 WHO WANT TO FLY. IS THIS NOT WHERE YOUR MONEY

29:28 GOES? JONATHAN: MY FLIGHTS ARE ALREADY BOOKED.

29:34 ANNMARIE: THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE HAS DONE SO

29:38 GOOD AFTER COVID, THE INFLUX OF AMERICANS THAT WANTS TO GO TO

29:39 SPAIN OR GREECE. JONATHAN: YOUR FLIGHTS ARE BOOKED, TOO.

29:46 THERE IS A G7 IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN A WORK TRIP.

29:48 TRY AND MAKE THAT HAPPEN. ANNMARIE:

29:51 I AM CLOSE TO MAKING THAT HAPPEN. JONATHAN:

29:55 MORE YUBA STATE AHEAD, PPI AND JOBLESS CLAIMS AT 8:30.

29:59 WAITING TO SEE IF PPI WILL CONFIRM CPI PRINT.

30:02 COMMENTARY COMING BITTER FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE. 8:45.

30:11 NO OFFENSE TO PRESIDENT LAGARDE, I WILL BE SPEAKING TO

30:12 JOHN WILLIAMS OF THE NEW YORK FED. LISA:

30:14 DOES THIS CHANGES FRAMEWORK? DOES THIS CALL INTO QUESTION

30:19 HOW STICKY DISINFLATION IS? PEOPLE LISTEN TO THREE PEOPLE

30:25 ON THE FED, THE VICE CHAIR, THE FED CHAIR, AND THE NEW YORK FED

30:26 PRESIDENT. THE NEW YORK FED PRESIDENT WHEN

30:31 HE COMES OUT TO SPEAK THEY SEE IT AS A PROXY OF JAY POWELL.

30:36 IF HE SAYS THIS HAS CHANGED THE NARRATIVE WE CANNOT HAVE THE

30:38 JUSTIFICATION TO CUT RATES, THAT WILL SOLIDIFY THIS

30:39 NARRATIVE SHIFT. JONATHAN:

30:41 EVERYONE HAS GOT ANY OPINION ON YESTERDAY'S CPI, INCLUDING THE

30:48 PRESIDENT OF THE U.S. PRES. BIDEN:

30:50 I STAND MY PREDICTION -- BY MY PRODUCTION THAT BEFORE THE END

30:53 OF THE YEAR THERE WILL BE RATE CUT.

30:56 WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FED IS GOING TO DO FOR CERTAIN.

31:02 WE HAVE DRAMATICALLY REDUCED INFLATION CLOSE TO 3%.

31:05 WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE WE ARE BETTER SITUATED THAN WE

31:07 WERE TO TAKE OFFICE.

31:14 ANNMARIE: YOU THINK THIS IS A HEADING FOR

31:17 THE FED, A MASSIVE PROBLEM THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION.

31:20 NOT ONLY DOESN'T MEAN THEY MIGHT NOT GET A CUT GOING INTO

31:22 THE ELECTION, IT IS APRIL. THIS MEANS IT IS GOING TO BE

31:28 TOP OF MIND FOR VOTERS GOING INTO THE SUMMER WHEN WE ARE

31:31 EXPECTING HIGHER GASOLINE PRICES. IF YOU LOOK AT THE ITEMS

31:37 PUSHING UP CORE INFLATION, HOUSING, CAR INSURANCE,

31:40 CLOTHING, EDUCATION, MEDICAL CARE, THIS IS HITTING THE

31:42 AMERICAN CONSUMER. THAT IS A MASSIVE PROBLEM.

31:44 JONATHAN: I DON'T THINK HE WAS OUT OF

31:45 LINE WITH THOSE COMMENTS. IT IS ALWAYS BEST TO NOT GO

31:48 THERE. DON'T TALK ABOUT THE FED AND

31:50 FED RATES. LISA: THIS IS THE REASON WHY THEY

31:55 DON'T WANT TO BE CUTTING RATES HEADING INTO INFLATION.

31:58 THEY DON'T WANT POLITICIANS TALKING ABOUT THEM.

32:02 THEY DON'T WANT TO JOE BIDEN AND FOR DON'T WANT DONALD TRUMP.

32:05 IF THEY START CUTTING RATES, WHO IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT THEM?

32:06 EVERYBODY. JONATHAN: HOT INFLATION PRINTS TO START

32:12 THE YEAR SHAPING THE FINANCIAL MARKETS.

32:18 VIRGINIE MAISONNEUVE OF ALLIANZ GLOBAL MARKETS, SHE SEES A MORE

32:22 STABLE INFLATION PICTURE IN EUROPE AND INFLATION

32:26 DESTABILIZING IN CHINA. SHE IS WITH US NOW.

32:32 CAN WE TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY, WHY THE MAG7

32:33 OUTPERFORMED ON A DAY WENT BOND YIELDS WERE UP DOUBLE DIGITS

32:35 AROUND THE CURVE? VIRGINIE:

32:41 IT MIGHT BE POSITIONING OF PEOPLE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF

32:45 UNCERTAINTY IF THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TECH IN THEIR PORTFOLIO.

32:51 I THINK THE MAG7 IS NOT PARTICULARLY WHERE YOU WANT TO

32:57 BE. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT TECH

33:01 OVERALL AND BET ON QUALITY TRUMP -- STRONG BALANCE SHEETS.

33:08 CYBERSECURITY AND THE IMPACT.

33:16 I THINK ON ANY RETREAT -- HE TO RESTART YOUR PORTFOLIO YOU

33:17 DON'T HAVE ENOUGH. YESTERDAY'S MOVE IS AN

33:20 ABERRATION. JONATHAN: PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HUNGRY FOR THE

33:25 ROTATION, LOOKING TOWARD SMALL CAPS, AWAY FROM THE MAG7, MORE

33:28 CYCLICAL THEMES. LOOKING ABROAD AS WELL TO

33:32 EUROPE AND JAPAN AND EVEN CHINA WILL RECENTLY.

33:36 DO YOU THINK WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY, THE REPRICING OF A

33:39 BOND YIELDS THIS FROM STEP TRADE AT ALL -- DISRUPTS THAT

33:43 TRADE AT ALL? VIRGINIE:

33:45 WE ARE AT A CROSSROAD OF -- INFLATION IN THE U.S.

33:50 IS MORE STICKY. WE HAVE HAD MEETING INDICATION

33:54 OF THIS HAPPENING. IT IS VERY RESIDENT.

34:00 YOU HAVE THIS INDUSTRIAL MANUFACTURING CYCLE PICKING UP.

34:07 PMI IN SWEDEN, EXPORTS FROM KOREA TO TAIWAN, I EXPECT

34:11 CHINESE EXPORTS TO BE WEALTHY. YOU HAVE A PICKUP IN THE CYCLE.

34:18 IF THAT CONTINUES, EARNING INFLATION IN THE U.S.

34:20 AIMS TO KEEP THAT. EUROPE IS WELL-PLACED ON THE

34:23 INFLATION FRONT.

34:29 IF GROWTH FALTERS AND YOU STICK INFLATION, THIS IS AN

34:33 ENVIRONMENT NOT AS PAUL -- NOT AS POSITIVE FOR THE MARKET.

34:38 WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH OIL PRICES AND GEOPOLITICS.

34:41 LISA: YOU TALK ABOUT CHINA AND INVESTING IN CHINA WHICH IS A

34:46 FASCINATING TRADE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GETTING ON BOARD.

34:52 IT COMES AFTER THE HOT CPI PRINT, CHINESE INFLATION

34:54 STALLED OUT AND IT IS MOVING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.

34:57 HOW MUCH IS THE INCREASING BET ON CHINA THE DIVERSIFICATION,

35:01 THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE STORY TO EVERYTHING ELSE? VIRGINIE:

35:04 THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT.

35:07 THEY MARKET IS VERY CHEAP AND THE CYCLE IS VERY DIFFERENT.

35:11 WE BELIEVE THE DEFLATIONARY TREND IN CHINA IS APPEASING.

35:16 IT IS NOT INTENSIFYING. AT THE SAME TIME WE ARE ABOUT

35:21 TWO THIRDS THROUGH THE WEIGHT IN TERMS OF PROPERTY ISSUES AND

35:25 CONSUMPTION IS STABILIZING. I BELIEVE EXPERTS WILL BE

35:28 PICKING UP. AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE IT HAS A

35:32 LOT OF SENSE. ANNMARIE:

35:38 WE SEE GOLDMAN SACHS AND MORGAN STANLEY RAISING THEIR OUTLOOK

35:40 FOR CHINA'S ECONOMIC GROWTH. DO YOU THINK IT WILL BE HIGHER?

35:44 VIRGINIE: FOR THE FIRST QUARTER WE COULD

35:46 HAVE POSITIVE SURPRISE FROM EXPORTS.

35:50 AS LONG AS WE HAVE QUALITY GROWTH, I AM HAPPY WITH IT.

35:53 WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IN CHINA IS THE POWER OF INNOVATION.

35:58 WE HAVE ALL THE CHINA COMPANY CHINA, THE POWER OF INNOVATION,

36:00 ETC. IT IS REALLY FASCINATING AND I

36:05 THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE NOT LOOKED AT IT.

36:10 THERE ARE INTERESTING COMPANIES THERE. JONATHAN:

36:13 CAN REFINISH ON THE U.S. AT THE PROSPECT OF DIFFICULT

36:14 TIMES AHEAD? THERE WAS A BELIEVE THAT

36:19 ULTIMATELY WHAT WE ARE SET UP FOR IS A HARD LANDING DOWN THE

36:20 ROAD. DO YOU THINK THERE ARE CHRONIC

36:24 RISKS ACCUMULATING IN THE SYSTEM?

36:28 THERE IS A PHRASE IN CREDIT WHICH IS SURVIVED UNTIL 2025 --

36:32 SURVIVED UNTIL 2025. MAYBE WE TAKE BRICKS OUT OF THE

36:36 SECURITY WALL BUT DO THINK THAT COULD BE A PROBLEM?

36:41 WHERE WOULD YOU BE FOCUSED ON THE ECONOMY? VIRGINIE:

36:47 LAST TWO PEOPLE EXPECTED SIX RATE CUTS, WE WERE NEVER IN

36:51 THAT CAN -- THAT CAMP. I THINK CLEARLY JUNE RATE CUT

36:54 IS OUT OF THE TABLE.

37:00 THE QUESTION IS EXPECTATIONS VERSUS REALITY.

37:05 IF YOU BELIEVE WE ARE ON THAT FIRST PATH WHERE GROWTH IS MORE

37:08 RESILIENT, INFLATION IS STICKY.

37:15 MOVEMENTS, WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF TALKING -- RESTOCKING.

37:19 THAT WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT GROWTH.

37:23 I THINK YOU'RE OKAY AND YOU WILL HAVE SOME RATE CUTS BUT IT

37:25 WILL PROBABLY NOT BE WHAT PEOPLE EXPECTED.

37:29 IF YOU HAVE NO RATE CUT, I THINK THE MARKET IS NOT THERE

37:34 TO TAKE THAT SCENARIO IN PLACE. WE COULD HAVE AN AIR POCKET

37:39 THAT PROVIDES A BUYING OPPORTUNITY. JONATHAN:

37:41 THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. VIRGINIE MAISONNEUVE OF ALLIANZ

37:45 GLOBAL. THE S&P DOWN A QUARTER OF A

37:50 PERCENT. DANI: MCKINSEY HAS BEGUN IS REZONED

37:55 DROP CUTS. THEY HAVE BEGUN A SLOWDOWN IN

38:00 DEMAND OF SERVICES EVEN AFTER A RECORD REVENUE LAST YEAR.

38:05 THEY HIT ABOUT 380 STAFFERS, 3% OF THEIR WORKFORCE CLASSIFIED

38:08 AS SPECIALISTS.

38:14 MCKINSEY'S TRADITIONAL STAFF WOULD BE AFFECTED AND THIS IS

38:18 AFTER THEY OFFERED U.K. STAFFERS NINE MONTHS PAY TO GO

38:19 AWAY. BAD WEATHER LOOKS TO DISRUPT

38:24 THE GOLF MASTERS IN AUGUSTA, GEORGIA.

38:28 THE FIRST ROUND WILL NOT BEGIN BEFORE 9 A.M..

38:32 SCOTTIE SHEFFLER IS FAVORED TO WIN.

38:36 NO FAVOR HAS GONE ON TO WIN THE TOURNAMENT SINCE TIGER WOODS.

38:42 TIGER WOODS SAYS HE IS STILL CAPABLE OF WINNING A SIXTH

38:45 GREEN JACKET IF "EVERYTHING COMES TOGETHER."

38:51 KKR IS WEIGHING A SALE OF IPO -- OR IPO OF BMC SOFTWARE WORTH

38:54 ABOUT $15 BILLION. OTHER FIRMS HAVE SHOWN INTEREST

38:58 IN ACQUIRING HOUSTON-BASED COMPANY.

39:01 NO FINAL DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE.

39:06 KKR STILL FAVORS AN IPO OF BMC WHICH PILED CONFIDENTLY LAST

39:07 YEAR.

39:08 AT 10:30 THIS MORNING, KKR -- LEASABLE HAVE IN EXCLUSIVE WITH

39:18 THE OFFICIALS. JONATHAN:

39:21 COMING UP LATER, SITTING DOWN WITH LISA.

39:23 WHAT IS THE BIG FOCUS FOR YOU? LISA: THEY WANT TO GROW TO $1

39:29 TRILLION OVER FIVE YEARS BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO INCREASE

39:30 THEIR HEADCOUNT AND I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHY.

39:33 IS THIS A FEATURE OR A BUG? AN A HIGH IMPROVEMENT STORY OR

39:36 SOMETHING ELSE? THAT IS AN INTERSTATE FOCUS.

39:41 JONATHAN: THAT IS A THEME. 10:30 EASTERN TIME.

39:45 DO NOT MISS THAT CONVERSATION. THE ECB RATE DECISION ON DECK.

39:54 >> WE MAY SEE THE ECB CUT AS OFTEN IF NOT MORE THAN THE FED

39:56 WHICH WAS UNIMAGINABLE. I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO

40:00 SIGNAL QUITE STRONGLY THAT JUNE IS WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO CUT.

40:04 SOMETHING THE FED WILL NOT DO.

40:20 JONATHAN: LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY

40:23 FOLLOWING YESTERDAY'S GLOVE ABOUT THE CPI REPORT, UPSIDE

40:26 SURPRISE, SPARKING THE BIGGEST SELLOFF WORLDWIDE.

40:30 EQUITY FUTURES -.3% ON THE S&P. YIELDS UNCHANGED.

40:37 BRAMO HAS THOUGHTS. LISA: YES, BUT IT WAS BROAD-BASED.

40:44 IT WAS THE SUPER, IT WAS EVERYTHING.

40:47 HAVING FOUR CONSECUTIVE MONTHS OF 0.4% MONTH OVER MONTH

40:52 INFLATION IS NOT GREAT. JONATHAN:

40:55 PUMPS ARE NO LONGER BUMPS.

41:01 THE EURO, 1.27. THE ECB DECISION ON DECK.

41:08 >> WE MAY SEE THE ECB CUT MORE OFTEN THAN THE FED.

41:10 WHICH WAS UNIMAGINABLE MONTHS AGO. IS HAVING A HUGE IMPACT ON

41:14 ABILITY OF PRICING. IS IT THAT IN THE BOND MARKET

41:17 AND THE CURRENCY MARKET. THEY ARE GOING TO SIGNAL QUITE

41:22 STRONG THAT JUNE IS WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO CUT.

41:28 JONATHAN: AN HOUR AND A HALF AWAY FROM

41:30 THE ECB DECISION, EXPECTED TO HOLD RATES STEADY PUT MARKETS

41:33 EXPECTING A PRICE CUT IN JUNE. WE SEE A CHANCE THE ECB WILL

41:38 PRICE A RATE CUT AT THIS MEETING HEARD THE FED'S LEVY TO

41:42 CUT RATES BUT WITH LESS URGENCY THAN THE ECB DID DAVID IS WITH

41:46 US ON AN INTERESTING CALL. DOES THIS TODAY CHANGE ANYTHING

41:55 ABOUT THE WAY YOU SEE THIS ECB?

42:02 DAVID: NOT THE ECB BUT THE FED PRESSURE HERE.

42:07 IT MIGHT HELP SOME COUNCILMEMBERS AND SOME

42:10 DECISION-MAKERS TO NOT SEE A BIG URGENCY OF RATE CUTS. WIFE?

42:18 SOME OF THE ECB MENTIONED THEY DON'T WANT TO BE TOO MUCH AHEAD

42:23 OF THE FED WOULD WE THINK THIS IS A WEAK ARGUMENT.

42:26 THE ARGUMENTS FOR RATE CUTS ARE MORE ON THE FUNDAMENTAL SIDE.

42:31 JONATHAN: WHY DO THINK IT IS A WEAK

42:36 ARGUMENT? WHY IS THAT SO WEAK?

42:40 DAVID: THE ARGUMENT AGAINST ANY REALLY

42:45 RATE CUT WOULD COME BY THE EXCHANGE RATE WITH THE ECB

42:49 WOULD EVERY -- WOULD BE AFRAID OF A WEAKER EXCHANGE RATE.

42:56 WE SEE IN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIVE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC ZONE BOTH

43:01 BECAUSE PRICES ARE RISING FASTER THAN IN THE U.S.

43:04 AND SWITZERLAND AND IN CHINA. A BECAUSE CHANGE RATE WOULD

43:15 HELP OFFSET THAT THE MORE YOU SURPRISE MARKETS WITH A RATE

43:21 CUT , THE MORE YOU HAVE THESE EFFECTS WHICH MIGHT HELP TO

43:25 REBALANCE A BIT BY ITS COMPETITIVENESS WHICH IS PRETTY

43:30 WEAK. JONATHAN:

43:31 IS THIS A CALL YOU THINK THE ECB SHOULD CUT RATES TODAY OR

43:33 YOU THINK THEY WILL CUT RATES TODAY? DAVID:

43:37 WE THINK THEY HAVE GOOD REASONS TO CUT RATES.

43:41 IT IS MORE IN THE CAMP OF THEY SHOULD CONSIDER THAT.

43:49 ALL THE INDICATIONS WE HAVE IS THAT THEY WANT TO BE

43:51 FORESEEABLE.

43:51 WHEN YOU WANT TO BE FORESEEABLE AND GUIDE FINANCIAL MARKETS,

43:58 YOU WON'T CUTS TODAY. WE THINK IT IS MISPLACED.

44:06 WE THINK CENTRAL BANKS CAN LIVE UP TO THE TRADITIONAL ROLE OF

44:08 NOT BEING PERCEIVABLE FOR FINANCIAL MARKETS.

44:10 THEY CAN ACHIEVE THE BEST EFFECTS FOR THE ECONOMY AND THE

44:13 INFLATION TRAJECTORY. LISA:

44:19 ARE YOU SAYING THE EURO ECONOMY NEEDS A WEAKER EURO TO FIGHT

44:22 THE FACT THAT PRICES HAVE BEEN GOING UP?

44:26 THEY ARE DEALING WITH NEAR SHORING, CHINA'S COMPETITION

44:29 AND TRYING TO REVIVE THEIR MANUFACTURING SECTOR? DAVID:

44:35 IT WOULD BE MORE HELPFUL THAN DOING HARM.

44:37 WHEN YOU'RE A CENTRAL BANK AND YOU LOOK AT THE EXCHANGE RATE,

44:39 YOU TWO EFFECTS. ONE IS REVIVING ECONOMIC

44:42 ACTIVITY. HE RECEIVED A TICK.

44:49 THIS IS THE CASE AND IN THE EURO ZONE AND THEN YOU MIGHT BE

44:53 AFRAID HE WEAKER EXCHANGE RATE INCREASES YOUR INFLATIONARY

44:56 POTENTIAL, IMPORTED INFLATION. RIGHT NOW WHEN WE LOOK AT THE

45:07 INCOME ON ITS -- THE COMPONENTS AND -- KEEPING INFLATION MOVING

45:10 AWAY FROM 2%, IT IS NOT REPORTED INFLATION.

45:13 WE DON'T HAVE SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES. THAT IS WHAT WE THINK ON

45:18 BALANCE IT IS QUITE A GOOD IDEA TO RELY ON EXCHANGE AND REVIVE

45:25 ECONOMIC GROWTH WITHOUT NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THE

45:28 INFLATION TRAJECTORY. LISA: JOHN ASKED YOU ABOUT

45:36 YESTERDAY'S CPA PRINT AND YOU SAID I BELIEVE THE ECB HAS A

45:37 MEETING TODAY.

45:43 YOU ARE SEPARATING THE TWO IS THE DIVERGENCE FROM CENTRAL

45:47 BANK ACTIVITY A FEATURE AND NOT A BUG BASED ON THE BACKDROP?

45:51 DAVID: IT IS DEFINITELY A FUTURE AND

45:53 NOT ONLY CENTRAL BANK ACTIVITY, DEMAND BACK DROP. THE U.S.

46:00 IS STILL HAVING STRONG DEMAND OF ECONOMIC GROWTH.

46:04 EURO GROWTH IS STAGNATING. THERE IS A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN

46:10 THE FUNDAMENTAL BACKDROP WHICH SHOWS UP ALSO IN INFLATION AND

46:12 INFLATION EXPECTATIONS.

46:18 WE THINK CENTRAL BANKS SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THIS DEVELOPMENT

46:20 AND ACT ACCORDINGLY. ANNMARIE: YOU HAVE SOME PEOPLE CALLING

46:25 FOR PARITY. WHERE DO YOU SEE THIS PARAGON

46:34 GIVEN THE LATEST -- SEE THIS GOING GIVEN THE LATEST DATA WE

46:36 HAVE SEEN WHEN IT COMES TO CPI? DAVID:

46:42 REGARDING FUNDAMENTALS, DIVERGENT FUNDAMENTALS WILL NOT

46:45 BE ENOUGH TO DRIVE THE EURO SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER.

46:53 UNITY ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF CENTRAL BANKS AND CENTRAL BANK POLICY.

46:57 WE THINK WHEN THE ECB INDEED LISTENS TO THE FUNDAMENTAL DATA

47:00 AND SURPRISED FUNDAMENTAL MARKETS, WE CAN SEE THE EURO

47:05 DROPS OUT OF THIS TRADING RATE. IT HAD BEEN STABLE IN THE LAST

47:06 YEAR.

47:13 IT DROPS OUT AND GOES BELOW THE 105 AND IN THE DIRECTION OF

47:14 PARITY. JONATHAN: THANK YOU. DAVID CALL THERE WITH A STUFF

47:21 ON THE ECB, WHY THEY SHOULD BE CUTTING INTEREST RATES.

47:24 WE WILL GET THE RATE CUT CALL AT 8:15.

47:28 THE CONSENSUS VIEW IS NO BRIDGE CUTS TODAY.

47:34 THIS FROM SOCGEN THIS MORNING, IF IT LOOKS LIKE A DUCK AND

47:36 SWIMS LIKE A DUCK AND >>, IT IS PROBABLY A DUCK.

47:41 IN THIS CASE, A PROBLEM FOR DOLLAR BARRIERS, BOND BOWLS,

47:43 AND THE ECB. LISA:

47:49 OR IS IT OF FUTURE FOR PCV -- IS INTO THE FUTURE OF THE ECB?

47:53 THEY WANT A WEAKER EURO TO STIMULATE THE MANUFACTURING

47:54 INDUSTRY. IT HAS BEEN STIMULATING THE

47:58 TOURISM INDUSTRY. THIS IS ONE OF THE KEY

48:01 QUESTIONS, HOW FAR CAN THAT ARE? JONATHAN: 1.0729.

48:10 COMING UP NEXT, WE WILL CATCH UP WITH KATY KAMINSKI, AND,

48:15 MARYLAND GOVERNOR WES MOORE. KATY KAMINSKI COMING UP IN FIVE

48:19 MINUTES. SHORT TREASURIES BEFORE AND

48:22 MORE REASONS TO BE SURE. LISA: SHE TRIED TO GO ALONG FOR A HOT

48:26 SECOND AND SAID THIS IS DIFFICULT.

48:30 KEY QUESTION HERE, WHAT IS THE NEXT STEP?

48:33 WE HEARD PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT 5% 10 YEAR YIELDS.

48:37 IS THIS PEOPLE GETTING OVERDRAMATIC BECAUSE IT SEEMS

48:38 LIKE SOMETHING EVERYONE IS DOING? JONATHAN:

48:44 DON'T YOU LIKE, WAS PEOPLE IN FIXED INCOME APPEARED TO BE --

48:46 TRADERS? WHERE ALL OF THE HEADLINES, THE

48:53 NOTES THAT PEOPLE SCREAMING BUY WITH A TENURE BUYBACK OF 450?

48:58 LISA: WHAT CONVICTION CAN YOU HAVE

48:59 WHEN PEOPLE CANNOT AGREE ON WHAT THE TERMINAL RATE IS?

49:03 JONATHAN: 450. LISA: ARE YOU TRYING TO SELL

49:05 SOMETHING. JONATHAN: WHERE WERE YOU?

49:12 WHERE WERE DO YOU AT YESTERDAY'S OPTION? LISA:

49:15 I THOUGHT YOU WERE DOING IT. JONATHAN: I DO THE OPTIONS.

49:21 THAT IS WHY I DO NOT TAKE CALLS, I'M BUSY IN THE

49:25 AFTERNOON DOING BOND AUCTIONS FOR TREASURY.

49:50 >> THIS LACK OF STABILITY WILL BE

49:57 WITH US FOR A WHILE AND I DON'T THINK THEY HAVE A CLEAR

49:59 STRATEGY TO MANAGE IT..

50:03 >> EVEN IF THEY CUT THIS YEAR, IT WILL NOT BE AS RELEVANT.

50:10 >> THE

50:19 SUE DOOR SLIP SHUT.

50:28 GOLDMAN SACHS SHIFT THEIR CALL TO JULY.

50:32 THEY GO FROM FOUR TO TWO. EVERYONE HAS HAD TO MAKE

50:37 CHANGES, INCLUDING EVERYONE IN FIXED INCOME.

50:42 CHECK OUT THIS BOARD.

50:48 ON THE 10 YEAR, 4.5%. LISA:

50:54 IN THE YIELD SPACE, SPEAKS TO REVISIONS NOT ONLY ON THE FRONT

50:57 END, BUT HOW FAR THE FED CAN CUT. STEPHEN ENGLANDER NOT ONLY

51:03 REVISED HIS FED FORECAST IN THE NEAR TERM BUT SAID WE EXPECT

51:05 THE TROUGH TO BE THREE .5% NOW. THIS IS A FEELING THAT

51:11 INFLATION WILL RUN HOTTER FOR LONGER.

51:22 ANNMARIE: WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE PPI

51:26 REPORT TO BE THE FINAL NAIL IN THE COFFIN FOR INDIVIDUALS

51:27 BETTING WHEN THE FED WILL CUT.

51:34 MORGAN STANLEY SAYING IT IS IN JEOPARDY AND DEPENDENT ON THE

51:37 PPI DATA, IT COULD TELL THE FED TOWARD A LATER START IN THE

51:38 CUTTING CYCLE. EVERYONE IS EXPECTING WE ARE

51:44 ALL IN TOWARDS THE END OF THE YEAR. JON:

51:51 THE ESTIMATE FOR JOBLESS CLAIMS, 215,000 THE PREVIOUS

51:52 WEEK. NEW YORK FED PRESIDENT JOHN

51:59 WILLIAMS IN DECEMBER, HE POURED COLD WATER ON THE DECEMBER CUT

52:03 CONVERSATION, WHICH WAS ENGINEERED BY CHAIRMAN POWELL

52:04 BY HIS BOSS.

52:07 >> TAKING A STEP BACK. SOME PEOPLE SAY THIS IS THE

52:10 FED'S FALL. THEY ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BLAME

52:15 THE FED NO MATTER WHAT BUT PEOPLE SAYING THE CHANGE IN

52:19 COMMUNICATION LUCINDA FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AT A TIME WHEN

52:24 INFLATION HAD NOT DIED.

52:30 HOW DO THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT MESSAGE?

52:33 HOW DO THEY GIVE COMMUNICATION THAT COUNTERS THE NARRATIVE IN

52:35 THE MARKET WITHOUT UNDERMINING ANY CREDIBILITY THEY HAVE? JON:

52:41 THOSE WORDS ARE PART OF DOES WORDS REMINDED ME OF -- THOSE

52:47 WORDS REMINDED ME OF SOMEONE. HE SAID THE CHANGE IN SUPER

52:52 COURT INFLATION NOW 8%. SIX MONTH ANNUALIZED INFLATION.

52:59 WE ARE STICKING TO OUR VIEW THAT THE FED WILL NOT CUT RATES

53:00 IN 2024. IS HE FINDING MORE COMPANY AS

53:04 WE GET MORE DATA? LISA: THE MARKET CONFIRMS THAT.

53:11 WE ARE SEEING TWO RATE CUTS BEING PRICED IN AND TEPIDLY.

53:13 THERE'S A QUESTION OF WHAT WE COULD BE MISSING.

53:16 SOMEONE CAME OUT AND SAID JUST QUIT.

53:19 WE ARE SEEING DISINFLATION. CHECK OUT WAGES.

53:25 YOU DO SEE PEOPLE POINT TO QUITS, SMALL BUSINESS OPTIMISM

53:26 FALLING. THERE ARE REASONS TO SEE THIS.

53:31 HOW MUCH CAN THE FED REALLY JUSTIFY MAKING A SHIFT GIVEN

53:36 THE HOT INFLATION READS, THE STRONG LABOR MARKET PRINTS, AND

53:41 THE POLITICAL BACKDROP? ANNMARIE:

53:48 PAUL DONNA -- PAUL DONOVAN IS SAYING THEY ARE SEEING

53:52 DISINFLATION IN EVERY CONSUMER PRICE PROSPECT BUT IN CERTAIN

53:53 STATES. IT'S DIFFICULT TO ARGUE THAT

53:59 STRUCTURAL INFLATION STICKINESS EXIST WHEN EVERY KEY SECTOR HAS

54:00 DEFLATION. THIS IS WHAT MAKES IT SO

54:02 COMPLICATED. JON: PPI JOBLESS CLAIMS COMING UP.

54:12 EQUITY FUTURES ON THE S&P -.25%, SOFTER AFTER YESTERDAY'S

54:13 SELLOFF. BOND YIELDS UNCHANGED.

54:22 4.5457 ON THE U.S. 10 YEAR. THE DOLLAR STRONGER AGAINST THE

54:26 EURO. COMING UP, KELLY ON THE RISK OF

54:30 HIGHER INFLATION. MARYLAND GOVERNOR WES MOORE ON

54:34 REBUILD EFFORTS IN BALTIMORE.

54:43 AND IAN LYNGAN.

54:49 INVESTORS CLOSING IN -- CLOSING THE DOOR ON A JUNE CUT.

54:54 SOMEONE WRITING THE REAL CONCERN IS FUTURE CPI PRINTS

54:57 GIVING CURRENT COMMODITY TRENDS. SHOULD THE INFLATION DATA START

55:02 TO PICK UP FURTHER, WE COULD SEE EVEN HIGHER RATES.

55:04 KATIE IS WITH US FOR MORE. I WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

55:10 THINGS LOOK LIKE -- LOOKED LIKE FOR YOU YESTERDAY.

55:14 >> SHORT SIGNALS HAD BEEN CONSISTENT THIS YEAR.

55:18 THEY HAD NOT COME TO FRUITION BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN ANCHORED

55:24 ON A DOVISH FED BUT WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS THE BREAKOUT

55:26 WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR IN FIXED INCOME, WHICH IS

55:30 BASICALLY IDENTIFYING THAT THERE IS MORE INFLATION THAN

55:33 PEOPLE WOULD LIKE AND INFLATION WILL BE HARDER TO GET LOWER.

55:38 THE BIGGEST THING I HAVE BEEN WATCHING BEFORE YESTERDAY WAS

55:41 COMMODITY PRICES. TAKE A LOOK AT PRECIOUS METALS.

55:43 INDUSTRIAL METALS AND ENERGY. THEY HAVE STARTED TO MOVE

55:48 SUBSTANTIALLY BEFORE THIS EVENT, WHICH IS GOING TO BE A

55:50 TAILWIND FOR A BETTER INFLATION NUMBER IN THE FUTURE, WHICH

55:54 MEANS WE ARE HERE FOR LONGER. JON:

55:59 WHY SHOULD YOU STICK WITH THE BONDS TRADE FOR LONGER?

56:03 CAN YOU BUILD ON THE SIGNAL COMING OUT OF THE COMMODITY

56:04 MARKET? CRUDE $90. WHAT GIVES YOU THE IMPRESSION

56:10 THAT THE LIFTING COMMODITIES IS SUSTAINABLE? KATY:

56:14 IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE SOME OF THE COMMODITY PRICES HAVE

56:17 MOVED, IT'S BEEN SUBSTANTIAL. TAKE A LOOK AT COPPER.

56:21 TAKE A LOOK AT GOLD PRICES. IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

56:24 ALSO ENERGY. WHEN YOU SEE HOW MUCH THOSE

56:28 PRICES HAVE INCREASED OVER THE LAST SIX WEEKS, WE HAVE ALSO

56:32 SEEN SOME OF THIS INFLATIONARY PRESSURES WE SAW IN

56:37 AGRICULTURAL SECTORS DISSIPATING AND BOTTOMING OUT

56:38 IN FEBRUARY. THIS MEANS A LOT OF THESE

56:44 DISINFLATION TRENDS AND NOW UPTRENDS ARE STARTING TO BE

56:48 VISIBLE IN ROCK COMMODITIES, WHICH TEND TO BE THE LEADING

56:49 INDICATOR. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE SAW IN

56:55 2022 WHEN WE SAW SUCH A HIGH INFLATION PRINT LATER.

56:58 SO THERE IS SOME CONCERN THAT THIS WILL BE A TAILWIND FOR THE

57:02 NARRATIVE OF THE FUTURE CPI LATER THIS YEAR AS THESE PRICES

57:06 PUT PRESSURE THROUGH THE SYSTEM. >> WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

57:10 WHERE THE BOND MARKET MOVES HAVE BEEN COMING.

57:13 IT'S BEEN INTERESTING ON THE SHORT END.

57:16 DIRECTLY CORRELATES TO FED POLICY.

57:19 THE LONG END IS THE CONFUSING PART BECAUSE WE SEE PEOPLE

57:22 RESET LONGER-TERM INFLATION EXPECTATIONS.

57:24 WHERE ARE YOU MOST SHORT? ARE YOU SEEING THESE SHIFTS IN

57:31 MOMENTUM IN THE LONG END WITH PEOPLE QUESTIONING WHETHER THE

57:33 FED HAS THE CONVICTION AND WILL TO BRING INFLATION LOWER?

57:39 KATY: SIGNALS ACROSS THE BOND CURVE

57:41 TECHNICALLY ARE STILL SHORT ACROSS THE CURVE.

57:45 A LITTLE SHORTER -- STRONGER ON THE SHORT END, BUT THERE IS

57:49 STILL A LOT OF CONCERN FOR LONG-TERM BONDS.

57:52 THE CONCEPT OF THIS IS STRAIGHTFORWARD.

57:55 IF INFLATION REMAINS STICKY, THERE'S A CHANCE THAT OWNING

58:00 LONG-TERM BONDS COULD HAVE A DETERIORATION IN VALUE.

58:04 SHOULD WE STAY STICKY IN INFLATION OR SHOULD WE CUT AND

58:09 NOT NEED TO AND THUS THOSE BOND PRICES IN RELATIVE TERMS WITH

58:10 INFLATION STICKY BECOME VULNERABLE?

58:13 A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE NOT THINKING ABOUT HOW LONG-TERM

58:19 CASH FLOWS ARE VULNERABLE TO STICKY IN LONGER-TERM INFLATION

58:21 EXPECTATIONS, WHICH MEANS THERE IS STILL DOWNWARD PRESSURE.

58:25 LISA: YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO SAY LOOK TO

58:26 RECENT HISTORY. EVERY TIME YIELDS GO TO A

58:33 CERTAIN POINT, IT BRINGS BUYERS IN. WHAT ARE YOU SEEING ON THE

58:37 TECHNICAL LEVEL ABOUT WHETHER PEOPLE ARE LINING UP TO BUY AT

58:42 CERTAIN LEVELS OR WHETHER THAT BID HAS EVAPORATED ALONG WITH

58:43 THE NARRATIVE? KATY: THIS IS NOT A CONVERSATION I'M

58:49 SEEING NOW BECAUSE I THINK PEOPLE NEED MORE CLARITY ON HOW

58:51 LONG IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO CUT. IF THEY REALLY DO BELIEVE THE

58:56 CUTS ARE COMING SOONER RATHER THAN LATER, THEN YOU WOULD

58:58 DEFINITELY EXPECT PEOPLE WANT TO GET IN AND LOCK IN THOSE

59:04 HIGHER RATES TODAY, BUT GIVEN ALL THE COMMENTARY ABOUT

59:06 INFLATION STICKINESS AND THE LONG-TERM BATTLE WE HAVE AHEAD,

59:10 IT IS UNCLEAR AT WHAT POINT WE WILL GET THAT SIGNAL.

59:15 I KNOW WE GOT IT IN OCTOBER WHEN WE SAW A 5% 10 YEAR, BUT

59:19 WE ARE STILL FAR FROM THAT. SO MAYBE 5% IS THE POINT WHEN

59:23 PEOPLE START TO SAY THERE'S NO WAY WE ARE GOING HIGHER.

59:27 BUT IT STILL COULD BE A CASE LIKE I SAID THAT WE HAD A BIG

59:31 STEEP IN HER WHERE PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED -- BIG STEEPENER

59:36 WHERE PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED. ANNMARIE:

59:40 YOU NAME CHECKED GOLD AS BEING DIFFERENT IN THE COMMODITIES

59:41 SPACE. WHAT DO YOU GIVE THIS GOLD

59:45 RESILIENCE TO? WHAT DOES IT COME DOWN TO? KATY:

59:51 FOR US, I THINK IT'S ABOUT REAL RATES.

59:54 THAT'S BEEN SOMETHING THAT'S INTERESTING TO ME FOR THE PAST

59:58 MONTH. GOLD PRICES HAVE GONE WAY UP.

01:00:00 IF YOU TAKE THIS SIMPLE ANALOGY. IF YOU WERE GOING TO BUY YOUR

01:00:03 S&P WITH GOLD. IN SOME SENSE, IT HAS NOT GONE

01:00:10 UP IN REAL TERMS. THAT SOMETHING WHEN DID IS THEY GET

01:00:12 OUT IN AN INFLATIONARY ENVIRONMENT.

01:00:17 INFLATION IS GOOD FOR EQUITY NOMINAL PRICES BUT THE FACT

01:00:22 THAT GOLD PRICES HAVE INCREASED SO MUCH SUGGESTS THAT REAL

01:00:26 RATES ARE NOT AS ATTRACTIVE, SO PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE GOLD AS A

01:00:30 STORE OF VALUE, SO INGOLD TERMS, THEY HAVE GONE DOWN.

01:00:36 IF YOU KEPT YOUR GOAL AT HOME, YOU COULD BUY YOUR S&P. JON:

01:00:40 I WILL HAVE TO GO BACK TO THOSE COMMENTS AND LISTEN TO THEM.

01:00:43 CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT ON EARTH IS GOING ON WITH GOLD AND ITS

01:00:46 RELATIONSHIP TO BOND YIELDS? FOR MOST OF THIS YEAR, GOLD HAS

01:00:51 RALLIED, YIELDS HAVE CLIMBED. IT HAS BEEN DEVELOPING.

01:00:54 THEN YESTERDAY HAPPENED. YIELDS RIPPED, GOLD DROPPED ON

01:00:58 A HOT INFLATION REPORT. WHAT IS THAT ABOUT? KATY:

01:01:04 THAT IS TRICKIER BECAUSE IT'S A ONE-DAY MOVE.

01:01:07 THE MOST RECENT MOVE TO US HAS LOOKED LIKE DECREASING REAL

01:01:11 YIELDS. WITH INFLATION INCREASING, YOU

01:01:12 WANT TO HOLD GOLD AS A STORE OF VALUE.

01:01:15 ON THE OTHER HAND, WHEN YOU HAVE THE SITUATION LIKE

01:01:19 YESTERDAY, IT MAY BE THE CASE THAT PEOPLE SEE IT AS AN

01:01:21 OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE PROFIT IN GOLD.

01:01:25 I'M NOT SURE BECAUSE YESTERDAY WAS AN IDIOSYNCRATIC DAY.

01:01:29 BUT IN GENERAL, GOLD HAS BEEN INCREASING AS A SAFE HAVEN

01:01:33 ASSET WHERE PEOPLE ARE THINKING ABOUT INFLATION GOING UP AS

01:01:34 SOMETHING WHERE YOU WANT TO STORE VALUE.

01:01:37 THAT'S WHY IT'S INTERESTING THAT THE S&P RELATIVE TO GOLD

01:01:38 HAS NOT INCREASED. JON: IT WAS A ONE-YEAR YEAR MOVE IN

01:01:42 THE BOND MARKET. KATY, THANK YOU.

01:01:52 SHORT FIX THAT FIXED INCOME, SHORT BONDS -- SHORT FIXED

01:01:54 INCOME, SHORT BONDS. LISA: BITCOIN WAS UP, I WANT TO POINT

01:01:57 OUT. I ONE-DAY MOVE WILL NOT DO

01:02:03 ANYTHING BUT I WONDER IF THE NEW TREND THAT IS DEVELOPING IS

01:02:08 SHORT BARNES, LAUREN GOLD -- SHORT BONDS, LONG GOLD.

01:02:11 THIS QUESTION OF WHETHER IT IS THE NEW BALLAST, THE NEW HAVEN

01:02:16 ON THE MARGINS GIVEN CENTRAL BANK BUYING AND OTHER CONCERNS.

01:02:18 JON: IT'S HARD TO KEEP UP. MORE TO TALK ABOUT.

01:02:27 DATA, PPI AND JOBLESS CLAIMS. 8:15, AN ECB RATE DECISION.

01:02:35 YOU WILL HEAR FROM PRESIDENT WOULD GUARD AND JOHN WILLIAMS

01:02:37 OF THE NEW YORK FED, SOME COMMENTS HOPEFULLY ON

01:02:39 YESTERDAY'S DATA. EQUITY FUTURES NEGATIVE BY ONE

01:02:41 THIRD OF A PERCENT. BLOOMBERG BRIEF WITH DANNY

01:02:43 BERGER.

01:02:49 >> THE ECB IS NOW AND WHAT HE

01:02:55 CALLS A PICKLE SAYS THE ALLIANZ CEO.

01:03:02 >> A100 BASIS POINTS DIFFERENCE. MARKETS COULD BE SPOOKED.

01:03:10 >> HE SPOKE TO ME EARLIER ON THE BLOOMBERG BRIEF, WHICH YOU

01:03:13 CAN CASH AT 5 A.M. EVERY WEEKDAY.

01:03:18 A WHO'S WHO OF BUSINESS AND TECH LEADERS GATHERED AT THE

01:03:21 WHITE HOUSE LAST NIGHT.

01:03:23 JAMIE DIMON, LARRY FINK, TIM COOK, JEFF BEZOS WERE ALL AMONG

01:03:29 THE ATTENDEES. ALSO SOME CELEBRITIES WERE IN

01:03:32 ATTENDANCE. U.S. CREDIT CARD DELINQUENCY RATES

01:03:37 WERE THE HIGHEST ON RECORD IN THE FOURTH QUARTER ACCORDING TO

01:03:41 A REPORT FROM THE FED BANK OF PHILADELPHIA.

01:03:45 ALMOST 3.5% OF CREDIT CARD BALANCES WERE AT LEAST 30 DAYS

01:03:48 PAST DUE AT THE END OF DECEMBER. THE NUMBER OF DEBTS THAT WERE

01:03:56 60 AND 90 DAYS LATE ALSO CLIMBED. JON:

01:04:01 NEXT, ANTITRUST ACTION HEATING UP OVER U.S. STEEL.

01:04:04 >> I STAND BY MY COMMITMENT TO AMERICAN WORKERS.

01:04:06 I WILL KEEP MY WORD. I STAND BY OUR COMMITMENT TO

01:04:09 OUR ALLIANCE. JON: WE WILL FOLLOW THAT STORY NEXT

01:04:12 ON THE PROGRAM. LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY THIS

01:04:15 MORNING, GOOD MORNING.

01:05:00 JON: EQUITY FUTURES ON THE S&P

01:05:06 NEGATIVE BY ONE THIRD OF 1%. YIELDS UP AGAIN, NOTHING LIKE

01:05:07 YESTERDAY. DOUBLE-DIGIT MOVES YESTERDAY

01:05:10 THROUGH THE CURVE. 4.5559% ON THE 10 YEAR.

01:05:17 ANTITRUST ACTION HEATING UP OVER U.S. STEEL.

01:05:21 >> I STAND BY MY COMMITMENT TO AMERICAN WORKERS.

01:05:23 I'M A MAN OF MY WORD. I'M GOING TO KEEP IT.

01:05:26 I STAND BY OUR COMMITMENT TO OUR ALLIANCE.

01:05:29 THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE DOING. JON:

01:05:34 PLEDGING HIS SUPPORT FOR AMERICAN WORKERS AS AN

01:05:44 ANTITRUST PROBE IS OPENED FOR NIPPON'S BID FOR U.S. STEEL.

01:05:47 COULD SHE DO SAYING JAPAN BELIEVES THE U.S.

01:05:53 -- KISHIDA SAYING JAPAN BELIEVES THE U.S.

01:05:54 WILL DO THIS APPROPRIATELY. CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH THIS

01:05:58 FOR THE U.S. PRESIDENT ON THESE ISSUES?

01:06:01 >> I WOULD ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO THINK OF HOW LONG THE ROPE IS.

01:06:05 I WOULD IMAGINE IT GO THROUGH THE NOVEMBER ELECTIONS.

01:06:11 EVER SINCE THIS DEAL WAS ANNOUNCED, THERE WAS

01:06:13 IMMEDIATELY AN UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS WILL TAKE A LONG TIME.

01:06:15 THERE'S NO REASON THIS HAS TO BE APPROVED BEFORE THE ELECTION.

01:06:21 I THINK TO ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR POINT ABOUT HOW TRICKY A TIGHT

01:06:26 ROPE THIS IS, THEY NEED THIS TO BE THOROUGHLY VETTED, DOT ALL

01:06:33 THE I'S AND CROSS ALL THE T'S, BUT LIKELY IT WILL TAKE INTO

01:06:35 THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THIS YEAR AND I SUSPECT AFTER THE

01:06:36 ELECTION. THERE'S NO REASON TO RISK ANY

01:06:40 TENSIONS FROM EITHER SIDE. NIPPON STEEL CAN BE PATIENT AND

01:06:46 I THINK THE DOJ WILL DO A THOROUGH ACCOUNTING OF THE

01:06:47 ENTIRE SITUATION. JON: THEY ARE LUCKY THIS IS JAPAN

01:06:53 BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN VERY RESPECTFUL, VERY AWARE.

01:06:54 THEY KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON. IS IT WORKING.

01:07:02 WHEN YOU MAKE MOVES LIKE THIS OR SUGGEST YOU WILL TOO

01:07:06 ATTRACTIVE VOTE -- TO ATTRACT THE VOTE IN PLACES LIKE

01:07:09 PENNSYLVANIA, ARE THERE SIGNS THIS IS BEGINNING TO WORK?

01:07:11 HENRIETTA: THE WAY I THINK ABOUT THE

01:07:14 ELECTION IN THIS STAGE IS YOU ARE TRYING TO SEE AN ABSENCE OF

01:07:15 UNFORCED ERRORS. PRESIDENT TRUMP CAME OUT

01:07:21 AGGRESSIVELY AGAINST THE DEAL AND PRESIDENT BIDEN WILL NOT

01:07:25 GIVE HIM AN INCH.

01:07:32 THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN VERY CONSCIENTIOUS OF WHERE THE

01:07:34 TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IN 2017 TOOK US ON TRADE.

01:07:37 ALL THE EXISTING TARIFFS ON CHINA ARE STILL ON.

01:07:41 THE STEEL AND ALUMINUM TARIFFS HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED BUT ARE

01:07:42 STILL IN EXISTENCE. SO THERE'S THIS WEIRD NEXUS OF

01:07:48 THE WORLD WHERE DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS UNDER FORMER

01:07:51 PRESIDENT TRUMP HAVE SORT OF OVERLAPPED A LOT ON TRADE AND I

01:07:56 THINK THEY ARE BOTH MAY BE SIMILAR POINTS AND IT'S ONE THE

01:07:57 DEMOCRATS FEEL COMFORTABLE MAKING.

01:08:01 AND FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TRYING TO OUTFLANK. LISA:

01:08:07 YOUR BASE CASE IS ANNMARIE: -- -- ANNMARIE: YOUR BASE CASE.

01:08:13 IT'S STILL ONE OF THE TOP CONCERNS.

01:08:16 WHEN WE GO OUT AND TAKE THESE SURVEYS.

01:08:19 HOW DO YOU SEE THE PRESIDENT SHIFTING HOW HE TALKS ABOUT THE

01:08:22 ECONOMY? BECAUSE IT IS NOT WORKING.

01:08:24 HENRIETTA: IT HAS NOT WORKED ALL YEAR

01:08:27 DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE ECONOMY HAS IMPROVED AND CPI

01:08:32 HAS COME DOWN SUBSTANTIALLY SINCE THE MIDTERMS. I WOULD

01:08:38 ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO LOOK HISTORICALLY AT WHAT VOTERS SAY

01:08:39 THEY CARE ABOUT. IT'S CONSISTENTLY THE ECONOMY.

01:08:45 THE ECONOMY, INFLATION AND YOUR POLLING IS 31% OF THE

01:08:47 POPULATION'S NUMBER ONE ISSUE. THE ISSUES ARE TREMENDOUSLY

01:08:52 IMPORTANT, ESPECIALLY AT THE HOUSEHOLD LEVEL AND AMONGST

01:08:53 FEMALE VOTERS IN THE UNITED STATES.

01:08:58 THEY HAVE A 10% MORE NEGATIVE VIEW OF THE STATE OF THE

01:09:01 ECONOMY THAN MALE VOTERS, PERHAPS BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE

01:09:03 EXPOSED TO MAKING HOUSEHOLD PURCHASES.

01:09:07 GAS PRICES CONTINUE TO BE AN ISSUE.

01:09:10 LOOK WHAT HAPPENED IN 2022 AND 2023.

01:09:13 EVEN WHEN INFLATION WAS 9% IN THE RUN-UP TO THE ELECTION,

01:09:16 DEMOCRATS WON ACROSS-THE-BOARD. AND THAT WAS IN THE SENATE,

01:09:22 WHERE THEY PICKED UP A SEAT, DESPITE HAVING MAJORITIES IN

01:09:24 THE HOUSE, SENATE AND WHITE HOUSE.

01:09:26 PRESIDENT BIDEN'S APPROVAL RATING WAS UNDERWATER AND THEY

01:09:31 STILL GAVE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THE WORST SHOWING OF A MARNE --

01:09:36 A MINORITY PARTY SINCE THE 1930'S.

01:09:40 SO WHEN PEOPLE SAY THE ECONOMY AND INFLATION ARE THE NUMBER

01:09:41 ONE ISSUES, HOW DO YOU JUSTIFY THEM GOING INTO THE BALLOT BOX

01:09:46 AND PULLING THE LEVER FOR DEMOCRATS, WHICH THEY HAVE DONE

01:09:48 CONSISTENTLY JUST AS RECENTLY AS FIVE MONTHS AGO?

01:09:52 WHILE IMMIGRATION AND NOW CRIME AND TERRORISM ARE TOP ISSUES

01:09:56 AMONGST REPUBLICAN VOTERS, WHAT WE SEE TIME AND AGAIN,

01:10:01 SPECIFICALLY JUST FIVE MONTHS AGO IN OHIO AND KENTUCKY AS

01:10:05 WELL AS VIRGINIA, IS THAT ABORTION IS IN FACT DRIVING

01:10:09 PEOPLE TO THE POLLS. WHEN THEY GO TO VOTE ON

01:10:15 ANYTHING, THEY PULLED THE LEVER ON DEMOCRATS.

01:10:17 I SUSPECT IT'S LARGELY ABORTION. SO THE RULINGS ON IVF IN

01:10:26 ALABAMA, THE NEW BAN IN ARIZONA, WHICH WAS JUST

01:10:28 UNVEILED LAST NIGHT BY REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE AND

01:10:31 SENATE THERE, ARE A REAL PROBLEM AND A REAL FACTOR IN

01:10:34 THE ELECTION, MORE SO THAN ECONOMY.

01:10:37 BECAUSE IT'S SORT OF NEBULOUS TO SAY I'M VOTING ON THE

01:10:38 ECONOMY. YOU GO IN AND SAY WHAT DO I

01:10:41 ACTUALLY CHANGE.

01:10:45 >> IT'S ALL IS LIKE A PROTEST POLL.

01:10:48 YOU GOING TO THE NEW POLLING BOOTH AND YOU ARE LIKE, WHAT

01:10:51 MATTERS IS ABORTION. IN THAT SENSE, WHAT IS GOING ON

01:10:57 IN ARIZONA, DOES THAT SHORE UP THAT THE DEMOCRATS CAN CONTROL

01:10:58 THAT SENATE SEAT? BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO THE

01:11:01 SENATE, THE REPUBLICANS HAVE AN ADVANTAGE. HENRIETTA:

01:11:06 REPUBLICANS ARE IN A POSITION OF EXTREME STRENGTH

01:11:07 GEOGRAPHICALLY AND STATISTICALLY.

01:11:13 ALL EIGHT SEATS ARE DEMOCRATIC SEATS REPUBLICANS ARE PUTTING

01:11:17 UP FIGHTS FOR IN MOSTLY PURPLE AND RED STATES.

01:11:21 DEMOCRATS HAVE NO BUSINESS WINNING FOUR ELECTION CYCLES IN

01:11:24 THE SENATE IN GEORGIA THE LAST COUPLE YEARS, LET ALONE ARIZONA.

01:11:31 I WOULD SAY THERE IS ONE REASON FOR THAT AND IT'S EVER SINCE

01:11:33 2016, IT'S DONALD TRUMP AND ABORTION. JON:

01:11:36 AND YOU SEE HOW IT'S BECOMING A BIGGER PROBLEM FOR THEM, HOW

01:11:40 PRESIDENT TRUMP AND EVEN KARI LAKE HAVE RESPONDED TO THAT

01:11:43 DECISION. HOW ARE THEY RESPONDING?

01:11:45 HOW ARE THEY MESSAGING TO THE ELECTORATE? HENRIETTA:

01:11:50 ARIZONA IS A PERFECT ENCAPSULATION BECAUSE THE

01:11:53 CANDIDATE IS MORE PROGRESSIVE

01:11:59 THAN JOE BIDEN AND KARI LAKE IS AN AVATAR FOR DONALD TRUMP AND

01:12:00 KIRSTEN CINEMA FOR NIKKI HALEY.

01:12:02 YOU ARE SEEING TRENDS IN THAT STATE CONSISTENTLY PERFORM

01:12:07 BIDEN AND TRUMP AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET.

01:12:12 KARI LAKE IS TRYING TO DISTANCE HERSELF FROM HER HISTORICAL

01:12:15 STATEMENTS ON ABORTION. NOW THEY ARE SORT OF TRYING TO

01:12:19 BACKTRACK. TO GET BACK TO THE ORIGINAL

01:12:24 POINT ABOUT UNFORCED ERRORS, IF THE FORMER PRESIDENT WILL SAY I

01:12:28 SUPPORT STATES RIGHTS, THEN THE STATE ASKED THE NEXT DAY, THIS

01:12:33 IS EXACTLY WHAT HE SAID HE SUPPORTED SO IT'S HARD TO

01:12:34 DISTANCE YOURSELF FROM IT. JON: WE ARE SEEING A LOT OF IT.

01:12:37 THANK YOU. HENRIETTA TREYZ.

01:12:43 ARIZONA IS FASCINATING. ANNMARIE:

01:12:47 THEY HAD A POTENTIAL INCUMBENT WHEN IT COMES TO KIRSTEN CINEMA.

01:12:52 SHE DECIDED TO BECOME AN INDEPENDENT IS NOT RUNNING.

01:12:55 THIS LAW WAS ON THE BOOKS BEFORE ARIZONA BECAME THE --

01:12:59 BECAME A STATE. THIS COULD POTENTIALLY GIVE

01:13:03 DEMOCRATS NOT JUST A SEAT BUT BY THE PRESIDENCY. JON:

01:13:08 WE SUPPORT STATES RIGHTS BUT NOT DECISIONS LIKE THOSE SEEMS

01:13:09 TO BE THE THEME. ANNMARIE: HOW DO THEY COMMUNICATE?

01:13:15 WE KNOW DONALD TRUMP AND REPUBLICANS STRUGGLE WITH

01:13:17 WOMEN, SUBURBAN WOMEN. A RULING LIKE THIS IS UNNERVING.

01:13:23 EVEN IF THEY ARE ANNOYED WITH GROCERY PRICES. JON:JON:

01:13:26 BIG FOCAL POINT GOING INTO NOVEMBER.

01:13:31 EQUITY FUTURES ON THE S&P SOFTER, DOWN ONE THIRD OF 1%.

01:13:36 NEXT, BALTIMORE HOPING TO HAVE ITS PORT FULLY RESTORED BY THE

01:13:37 END OF ME. MARILYN GOVERNOR WES MOORE

01:13:40 JOINS US NEXT. FROM NEW YORK CITY, THIS IS

01:13:42 BLOOMBERG. ♪

01:14:00 JONATHAN: ON PAUSE. YESTERDAY WAS A WEEK OR YEARS

01:14:05 WORTH THE PRICE ACTION IN THE BOND MARKET.

01:14:44 YESTERDAY WAS A REALLY SLOPPY ONE.

01:14:47 THE 30 YEAR BOND $22 BILLION WORTH THIS AFTERNOON.

01:14:51 >> AT A TIME WHEN PEOPLE CAN'T PUT A FINGER ON WHAT INFLATION

01:14:52 WILL BE OVER THE LONGER TERM.

01:14:58 IT WAS A RESET ABOUT HOW STICKY THIS INFLATION IS AND WHAT IT

01:15:00 MEANS LONGER TERM WHICH IS WHY YOU HAD DEALERS TAKING UP THE

01:15:05 GREATEST AMOUNT OF THE 10 YEAR AUCTION GOING BACK TO LATE 2022.

01:15:10 DO YOU SEE A REPEAT OF THAT AS PEOPLE PUSHBACK AND SAY WAIT A

01:15:12 SECOND WE HAVE TO RETHINK WHAT LEVELS ARE WE LOOKING AT IN

01:15:49 THE DOLLAR RIPPING OF THE GREATEST PACE SINCE THE BANKING

01:15:52 CRISIS IN MARCH OF 2023 SO AT WHAT POINT TO CENTRAL BANKS

01:16:33 I -- HE SAID WE ARE MAKING A LOT OF PROGRESS WE NEED TO BE

01:16:45 LANDING AND WHETHER OR NOT THE FED AND POTENTIALLY WILL HEAR

01:16:48 FROM THE FED PRESIDENT WHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL HAVE TO ACCEPT

01:16:58 ECONOMY.

01:16:59 >> HUMILITY THAT WE ALL NEED A DOSE OF.

01:17:03 UNSURE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE ECONOMY AND MARKETS.

01:17:05 THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS TALKING ABOUT BIG ROTATIONS AND

01:17:27 MUCH OF THE WORLD CHANGING AI WILL BE BUILT ON TOP OF

01:17:36 IT WILL BE FOR AI.

01:18:06 FRANCHISES, GROCERIES, ETC.. IT'S BASICALLY THE SAME THING

01:18:11 BUT REVAMPED AND A LOT MORE FLOW OF THAT FIRE.

01:18:14 >> A LITTLE BIT SOFTER IN THE PREMARKET.

01:18:18 THE NTSB SAYS ITS INVESTIGATION INTO THE BRIDGE COLLAPSE IS

01:18:24 ONLY ON THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM. PRESIDENT BIDEN SAYING THE

01:18:26 FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL PAY FOR THE RECOVERY AND REBUILD.

01:18:29 THE GOVERNOR SAYING HE HOPES TO RESTORE FULL SERVICE IN

01:18:30 BALTIMORE. POLICE -- JOINING US IS THE

01:18:36 GOVERNOR WES MOORE. I KNOW IT'S BEEN A DIFFICULT

01:18:38 MONTH FOR YOU AND THE PEOPLE OF YOUR STATE. VERY DIFFICULT.

01:18:44 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS COMMITTED TO FUNDING

01:18:46 THE COST OF THE REBUILD. HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU YOU CAN

01:18:49 GET THAT FINANCING THROUGH CONGRESS.

01:18:54 >> I'M CONFIDENT THAT IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE CAN GET IT.

01:18:59 IF YOU LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC IMPACT THE PORT OF BALTIMORE IS

01:19:04 WORTHY AND CONTRIBUTES ABOUT $70 BILLION TO THE AMERICAN

01:19:05 ECONOMY. THE PORT OF BALTIMORE IS THE

01:19:10 LARGEST PORT IN THIS COUNTRY FOR NEW CARS, FOR HEAVY TRUCKS,

01:19:14 FOR AGRICULTURAL EQUIPMENT.

01:19:20 FOR COAL THE HUGE CHUNK OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY RELIES ON THE

01:19:22 PORT OF BALTIMORE AND SO I AM THANKFUL THE PRESIDENT HAS LED

01:19:27 AND RIGHTFULLY ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEK WAS NOT JUST

01:19:29 A HUMAN CATASTROPHE. WE LOST SIX MARYLANDERS DURING

01:19:37 THIS CATASTROPHE AND IT WAS NOT JUST ECONOMIC IT'S ASTRA FEE

01:19:38 FOR MARYLAND BUT FOR THE REGION. THIS WAS A CATASTROPHE FOR THE

01:19:43 COUNTRY SO OUR ABILITY TO RALLY AND A BIPARTISAN FASHION AND BE

01:19:48 ABLE TO GET THAT AND REOPEN THE PORT AND GET THE BRIDGE REBUILT

01:19:50 IS GOING TO BE A NATIONAL PRIORITY. JONATHAN:

01:19:54 REOPEN THE PORT AND REOPEN THE BRIDGE CAN WE DEAL WITH THE

01:19:59 FIRST ONE FIRST. REOPEN THE PORT, HOW STRAIGHTFORWARD IS

01:20:03 THAT GOING TO BE?

01:20:05 GOV. MOORE: WE'VE NEVER HAD A MARITIME

01:20:08 DISASTER LIKE THIS WHERE YOU HAVE NOT ONLY A VESSEL IT'S THE

01:20:14 SIZE OF THE EIFFEL TOWER AND THE WEIGHT OF THE WASHINGTON

01:20:18 MONUMENT THAT IS NOW STUCK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PATAPSCO

01:20:21 RIVER AND PART OF IT IS BECAUSE IT HAS A BRIDGE, AN ICONIC

01:20:27 BRIDGE SITTING ON TOP OF IT. 3000 4000 TONS SITTING ON TOP

01:20:30 OF THE BRIDGE. SO THIS IS STILL REMARKABLY

01:20:36 PERILOUS OPERATION WHERE WE HAVE DIVERS IN THEIR EVERY DAY

01:20:40 AND THEY CANNOT SEE ANYWHERE BETWEEN A FOOT OR TWO IN FRONT

01:20:42 OF THEM. BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF

01:20:45 WRECKAGE IN THE WATER. THE ABILITY TO OPEN UP CHANNELS

01:20:51 THAT CAN NOW HAVE 14 FOOT DEPTHS.

01:20:55 WE HAVE HAD 59 COMMERCIAL TRENDS -- TRANSFERS THAT HAVE

01:20:56 ALREADY TAKEN PLACE. AND HOPEFULLY BY THE END OF THE

01:21:04 MAY WE WILL FULLY OPERATIONAL FUNCTIONS OF THE PORT.

01:21:10 ANNMARIE: WHAT ABOUT THE REBUILD OF THE

01:21:12 BRIDGE? WHAT IS THIS TIMELINE LOOK LIKE?

01:21:17 GOV. MOORE: THE REBUILD WILL BE A LONGER

01:21:18 TIMELINE.

01:21:19 THAT OVER 36,000 PEOPLE WENT OVER THAT BRIDGE EVERY SINGLE

01:21:24 DAY. THAT WAS THE BRIDGE THAT GOT

01:21:27 PEOPLE FROM WHERE THEY LIVED TO WHERE THEY WORKED, TO WHERE

01:21:31 THEY WENT TO SCHOOL. IT WAS ALSO A KEY AND CRUCIAL

01:21:37 PART OF PORT OPERATIONS BECAUSE FOR THE PORT OF BALTIMORE IT'S

01:21:41 NOT JUST MARITIME OPERATIONS IT'S ALSO TRUCK OPERATIONS.

01:21:47 IN ORDER TO TRULY GET THE PORT OF BALTIMORE UP AND GOING IN

01:21:52 THE SAME KIND OF FASHION IT WAS BEFORE GETTING THAT BRIDGE

01:21:53 REBUILT IS GOING TO BE IMPERATIVE AND WE KNOW THAT

01:21:56 WILL BE A LONGER TIMELINE WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE WE

01:21:57 GET THE KEY BRIDGE REBUILT.

01:22:00 >> I KNOW THAT'S WHY YOU WILL BE IN WASHINGTON TODAY SPEAKING

01:22:03 TO LAWMAKERS ABOUT REBUILDING THIS.

01:22:06 >> I WAS STRUCK BY WHAT WAS SAID YESTERDAY, HE SAYS HE

01:22:09 WANTS TO GET THIS REBUILT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BUT SAYS IT IS

01:22:15 BUREAUCRATIC GOVERNING AND LENGTHY ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS

01:22:19 BLAMING ON DEMOCRATS FOR THIS BUREAUCRACY THAT COULD

01:22:21 POTENTIALLY MAKE THIS A LONG-TERM PROCESS AND NOT AS

01:22:26 QUICK AS YOU AND RESIDENTS OF MARYLAND WANT TO SEE.

01:22:30 DO YOU AGREE THIS SHOULD BE FAST TRACKED? GOV. MOORE:

01:22:38 I'M THANKFUL SENATOR CRUZ IS A YES ON MAKING SURE WE CAN GET

01:22:40 100% FUNDING. WE GET THE PORT REOPENED AND

01:22:44 ALSO THE BRIDGE REBUILT. I ALSO KNOW THE WHITE HOUSE.

01:22:52 I HAVE -- I HAD MY FIRST CALL FROM THE WHITE HOUSE AT 3:00 IN

01:22:53 THE MORNING ON THE DAY OF THIS TRAGEDY.

01:22:59 THE SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION WAS LITERALLY DOWN THERE WITH

01:23:02 BOOTS ON THE GROUND FOR NOON TO BE ABLE TO ASSESS THE DAMAGE

01:23:05 AND WHAT THEY CAN DO TO HELP. I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE A PHONE

01:23:10 CALL FROM SENATOR CRUZ, A VISIT FROM SENATOR CRUZ.

01:23:11 I WOULD WELCOME HIM TO COME TO BALTIMORE TO SEE THE

01:23:16 CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE SITUATION WE ARE DEALING WITH AND I'M

01:23:19 SURE IF HE CAME HE WOULD SEE THERE ARE MEMBERS OF THE BIDEN

01:23:22 ADMINISTRATION WHO HAVE BEEN THERE THE WHOLE TIME.

01:23:28 I KNOW THIS NEEDS TO MOVE QUICKLY.

01:23:31 IT NEEDS TO MOVE FAST. WE NEED TO FOCUS ON SAFETY AND WE HAVE

01:23:35 TO GET THIS REBUILT AND I'M GLAD WE ARE BUILDING A

01:23:37 BIPARTISAN SUPPORT STRUCTURE AROUND WHAT IT'S CAN IT TAKE.

01:23:40 LISA: YOU TALK ABOUT HOW QUICKLY IT'S

01:23:42 BEEN A REBUILD THE BRIT -- IMPORTANT IT IS TO REBUILD THE

01:23:44 BRIDGE. FROM EVERY FACET OF THE REGION

01:23:48 HOW MUCH YOU EXPLORING OTHER TYPES OF FINANCING IF IT

01:23:50 DOESN'T COME FROM THE GOVERNMENT WEATHER IS ISSUING

01:23:52 BONDS OR GETTING PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS.

01:23:59 >> I THINK THAT ALL OPTIONS SHOULD BE ON THE TABLE AND ALL

01:24:02 OPTIONS ARE ON THE TABLE. I DON'T COME FROM A POLITICAL

01:24:08 BACKGROUND.

01:24:09 I SPENT -- I WAS A PERRY -- PARATROOPER WITH THE 82ND

01:24:10 AIRBORNE DIVISION. I STARTED A BUSINESS WHEN I

01:24:13 LEFT THE ARMY SO I UNDERSTAND THE MOMENT OF PUBLIC SECTOR AND

01:24:18 PRIVATE SECTOR, THAT THEY WILL PLAY IN THIS.

01:24:24 WE'VE USED EVERY LEVEL -- LEVER IN OUR DISPOSAL TO ADDRESS THIS

01:24:25 ISSUE. I ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER

01:24:29 THAT REALLY $60 MILLION OF STATE FUNDING FOR PORT WORKERS.

01:24:36 WE SIGNED LEGISLATION THAT FOCUSED ON THINGS LIKE

01:24:38 PROVIDING SCHOLARSHIPS TO CHILDREN OF TRANSPORTATION

01:24:41 WORKERS AND ALSO PROVIDING ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS FOR

01:24:44 BUSINESSES. WE ALSO HELPED LAUNCH SOMETHING

01:24:47 CALLED THE MARYLAND TOUGH BALTIMORE STRONG ALLIANCE WHICH

01:24:51 IS OVER 80 ORGANIZATIONS PRIVATE SECTOR, BUSINESSES AND

01:24:54 PHILANTHROPY WE RAISE $50 MILLION GOING TOWARDS PORT

01:24:57 WORKERS AND ALSO FOR BUSINESSES TO DO THINGS LIKE NOT LETTING

01:24:58 OFF THEIR WORKERS. THEY HAVE TO MOVE OPERATIONS IN

01:25:03 THE PORT OF BALTIMORE THEY'VE COMMITTED TO BRINGING THEM BACK

01:25:05 TO THE PORT OF BALTIMORE. SO WE KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:25:10 USE EVERY SINGLE LEVER AT OUR DISPOSAL AND EVERY SECTOR,

01:25:15 PRIVATE SECTOR, PUBLIC SECTOR, PHILANTHROPY HAVE TO BE

01:25:17 INVOLVED AND AT THE TABLE FOR US TO GET TO OUR LONG-TERM

01:25:18 CONCLUSIONS. LISA: YOU FULLY UNDERSTAND THE

01:25:24 IMPORTANCE OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE RAMIFICATIONS COULD BE

01:25:25 THE LONGER THIS GOES ON. IS THERE A DROPDEAD TIME WHERE

01:25:31 IT TAKES TWO YEARS AND THAT'S THE MAXIMUM IT COULD TAKE TO

01:25:33 REBUILD THIS BRIDGE AND GET OPERATIONS TO REOPEN THE PORT

01:25:39 TO GET THINGS BACK UP AND RUNNING WHERE IT MARYLAND AND

01:25:42 BALTIMORE CAN WITHSTAND THAT VERSUS AFTER THAT WORD BECOMES

01:25:45 A REAL FINANCIAL WEIGHT THAT HAS MUCH MORE PUNITIVE

01:25:50 CONSEQUENCES? ANNMARIE: -- GOV. MOORE:

01:25:52 IT'S A FINANCIAL WEIGHT NOW AND IT'S THE REASON WE ARE MOVING

01:25:53 AS FAST AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE. THE REASON IT WHEN HE 47

01:25:59 OPERATIONS AND THAT CADENCE, THAT SPEED IS NOT GOING TO STOP.

01:26:03 I'M COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE WE ARE, -- MOVING WITH SPEED ON

01:26:06 THIS. THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

01:26:08 PORT WORKERS THE RIGHT NOW ARE BEING IMPACTED BY THIS.

01:26:13 THERE ARE ENTIRE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE WATCH THEIR WAY OF

01:26:14 LIFE COMPLETELY UP ENDED. THERE ARE INDUSTRIES THE

01:26:19 COUNTRY RELIES ON THAT ARE NOW AT EITHER A STOP OR A STALL

01:26:23 BECAUSE OF WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH THIS TRAGEDY.

01:26:29 SO HOW IMPERATIVE IT IS WE MOVE FAST WITH THIS SITS WITH ME

01:26:30 EVERY DAY. AND I KNOW WE ARE GOING TO AN

01:26:36 ON-DEMAND 20 47 OPERATIONS UNTIL WE ACCOMPLISH THOSE

01:26:39 GOALS, RING CLOSURE TO THESE FAMILIES, REOPEN THESE

01:26:42 CHANNELS, MAKE SURE WE ARE TAKING CARE OF OUR PEOPLE

01:26:45 IMPACTED BY THIS AND GETTING THE BRIDGE REBUILT. JONATHAN:

01:26:47 HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU NEED?

01:26:54 GOV. MOORE: WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL PRICE

01:26:56 TAG ON THAT RIGHT NOW, WE KNOW THIS IS GOING TO BE A LONG

01:26:59 JOURNEY. WE KNOW THIS WILL BE SOMETHING

01:27:01 THAT IS EXPENSIVE.

01:27:07 WE ALSO KNOW WHAT'S TAKEN PLACE THUS FAR.

01:27:09 IF YOU WOULD ASK ME TWO WEEKS AGO AND SEE WHAT I SAW AND SAID

01:27:14 TWO WEEKS LATER WE WOULD HAVE TWO COMMERCIAL CHANNELS OPEN

01:27:16 BUT BY THE END OF THIS MONTH WE SHOULD HAVE UP TO A 35 FOOT

01:27:19 DEPTH OF DRAFT THAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THE NEW CARS AND

01:27:23 ROLL-ON ROLLOFF THE PORT OF BALTIMORE RELIES ON AND BY THE

01:27:25 END OF MAY WE SHOULD HAVE THE PORT FULLY FUNCTIONING I

01:27:29 WOULD'VE SAID WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DAMAGE AND DEVASTATION WE

01:27:33 SAW I WOULD SAY THAT SEEMS VERY AMBITIOUS BUT THAT'S WHERE WE

01:27:37 ARE. SO WE KNOW THIS IS GOING TO BE

01:27:39 A LONG-TERM, WE KNOW THIS WILL NOT BE INEXPENSIVE.

01:27:43 IT'S A JOURNEY WE HAVE TO BE COMMITTED TO BECAUSE THIS NEEDS

01:27:46 EVERYTHING -- MEANS EVERY THING TO NOT JUST OUR REGION BUT

01:27:48 LONG-TERM GROWTH OF MARITIME OPERATIONS.

01:27:53 >> I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO BE A LONG ROAD AHEAD FOR YOU AND

01:27:56 YOUR STATE AND AN ONGOING CONVERSATION HOPEFULLY WE CAN

01:27:57 TALK TO YOU AGAIN IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU.

01:28:03 THE GOVERNOR OF MARYLAND, DIFFICULT CONVERSATION AFTER

01:28:04 THAT BALTIMORE BRIDGE COLLAPSED. IT'S IMPORTANT TO ASK I'M NOT

01:28:10 EXPECTING A PRECISE FIGURE. IF YOU'RE GOING TO CONGRESS

01:28:15 THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE PRICE TAG IS. LISA:

01:28:18 AND TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT'S GOING TO BE DEPLOYED.

01:28:21 HOW CHALLENGING IT IS TO MOVE SOMETHING EQUAL TO THE MONUMENT

01:28:26 -- STATUE OF LIBERTY OR EIFFEL TOWER OVER IT.

01:28:31 AT WHAT POINT TO SOME OF THE DOCK WORK MOVE AWAY FROM THE

01:28:33 REGION. AT WHAT POINT DOES THE TRAFFIC

01:28:37 PUSH PEOPLE AWAY FROM LIVING IN THAT REGION FOR ALL THESE

01:28:38 LONGER-TERM IMPLICATIONS THAT GO ON THE LONGER IT TAKES TO

01:28:41 REBUILD. ANNMARIE:

01:28:49 TO YOUR POINT JONATHAN HOW MUCH WILL IT COST. WHEN PROFESSOR

01:28:51 THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO IS LOOKING AT WHAT HAPPENED WHEN

01:28:58 THE MARIO CUOMO BRIDGE, HE SAID IT'S GOING TO BE AT LEAST $4

01:28:59 BILLION. AND POTENTIALLY THAT NUMBER CAN

01:29:01 GET HIGHER.

01:29:05 >> A BIG NUMBER AND MAY BE DEFINITE COMMITMENT AS WELL.

01:29:10 STORIES ELSEWHERE HERE'S YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF WITH DANI

01:29:14 BURGER. DANI: THE U.S.

01:29:17 AND ITS ALLIES WARNING OF A STRIKE BY IRAN OR ITS ALLIES.

01:29:23 THE ATTACK MAY HAPPEN IN THE COMING DAYS.

01:29:26 A SIGNIFICANT WIDENING OF THE CONFLICT.

01:29:28 THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAS OPENED AN EXTENDED ANTITRUST

01:29:32 INVESTIGATION INTO THE TAKEOVER BID FOR U.S. STEEL.

01:29:35 THE COMPANIES HAD HOPED FOR APPROVAL IN THE SECOND OR THIRD

01:29:37 QUARTER BUT THIS WILL LIKELY DELAY AT.

01:29:41 THE TAKEOVER HAS BECOME A HOT BUTTON ISSUE FOR THE SELECTION.

01:29:44 RESIDENTS BY AND SAYS HE WANTS U.S.

01:29:46 STEEL TO REMAIN DOMESTICALLY OWNED BUT STOP SHORT OF MAKING

01:29:47 AN EXPLICIT PUSH TO KILL THE DEAL.

01:29:50 DONALD TRUMP SAID HE WOULD TRY TO QUASH THE TAKEOVER.

01:29:54 BAD WEATHER LOOKS SET TO DISRUPT THE FIRST DAY OF GOLF'S

01:29:57 U.S. MASTERS. OFFICIALS ANNOUNCED THE FIRST

01:30:00 ROUND WON'T BEGIN BEFORE 9:00 A.M. EASTERN.

01:30:04 THE FAVORITE TO WIN HIS SECOND GREEN JACKET.

01:30:12 SINCE TIGER WOODS DID IN 2005. AS FOR WOODS HE IS STILL

01:30:17 CAPABLE OF WINNING HIS SIXTH GREEN JACKET AND SIX MAJOR IF

01:30:18 EVERYTHING COMES TOGETHER. THAT'S YOUR BRIEF.

01:30:23 >> NOTHING ELSE MATTERS THIS WEEKEND. NOTHING.

01:30:26 SCOTTY, RORY MCELROY. I'VE GOT NO IDEA WHEN.

01:30:31 >> WHEN DOES IT END? JONATHAN: SUNDAY. WHY? ANNMARIE:

01:30:35 WE HAVE A FEW DAYS LEFT. LISA: I GET TO WATCH HIM JUST TALK TO

01:30:39 HIMSELF OR THE SCREEN. JONATHAN: EVERYONE AT HOME KNOWS THIS IS

01:30:44 THE MOST THERAPEUTIC GOLF TOURNAMENT ON THE PLANET.

01:30:47 IT'S JUST QUIET AND BEAUTIFUL. THERE YOU GO.

01:30:53 YOU CAN JOIN JIM THIS WEEKEND. SLAMMING THE DOOR ON JUNE.

01:31:01 >> THE SOUND YOU HEARD WAS SLAMMING ON JUNE.

01:31:04 HE CAN CONVINCE THE COMMITTEE OF SOMETHING THE COMMITTEE DOES

01:31:05 NOT ON AVERAGE WANT TO BELIEVE.

01:31:09 >> LIVE FROM NEW YORK THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

01:31:25 JONATHAN: SESSION LOWS ON THE S&P 500

01:31:27 NEGATIVE BY 0.5%. SOFTER YESTERDAY, YIELDS OFF A

01:31:31 SINGLE BASIS POINT. ADDING TO THAT 10 YEAR YIELD.

01:31:36 AFTER A DOUBLE DIGIT MOVE YESTERDAY.

01:31:39 SLAMMING THE DOOR ON JUNE.

01:31:42 >> THE SOUND YOU HEARD WAS THE DOOR SLAMMING ON THE JUNE RATE

01:31:47 CUT. JAY POWELL WANTS TO ACHIEVE CONSENSUS.

01:31:50 IT CAN CONVINCE THE COMMITTEE OF SOMETHING HE DOESN'T DO ON

01:31:52 AVERAGE -- THAT THEY DON'T ON AVERAGE WANT TO BELIEVE.

01:31:56 I'D BE HAPPY ENOUGH IF THEY STARTED TO CUT RATES IN JUNE

01:31:58 BUT I THINK THIS MEANS THEY WILL.

01:32:03 >> BOND YIELDS SOARING ON THE HEELS OF ANOTHER HEALTH CPI

01:32:06 PRINT WITH INVESTORS EXCEPTING THE FIRST RATE CUT TO COME IN

01:32:07 SEPTEMBER. IF THE FED NEEDS MORE CONVINCING, RUNNING UP AGAINST

01:32:12 THE OPTICS OF CUTTING RATES AND MEET ME AFTER THE PRESIDENTIAL

01:32:16 ELECTION. WE ARE NOT WILLING TO TAKE A

01:32:19 SEPTEMBER 1 CUT OFF THE TABLE BUT IT WOULD REQUIRE A SHARP

01:32:25 RUSH TO JUSTIFY THE PONDERING IS SEPTEMBER DEPARTURE POINT.

01:32:29 GOOD MORNING TO YOU. STARTING AT 8:30 YESTERDAY

01:32:33 LET'S PRETEND THIS JUST DROPPED. IF WE WERE A FEW BASIS POINTS

01:32:40 AROUND .4 PRAYED HOW DIFFERENT WOULD OUR CONVERSATION BE THIS

01:32:46 MORNING.

01:32:47 >> IF WE HAD SEEN A .3 PRINT IS THAT OF A .4 WE WOULD BE

01:32:52 LOOKING AT THE DATA AND MIGHT BE PARSING THROUGH SOME OF THE

01:32:56 DETAILS BUT WE WOULD BE THINKING THE FED HEADED RIGHT

01:32:59 TO ASSUME JANUARY WAS JUST A BUMP ON THE ROAD TO

01:33:01 NORMALIZATION AND WE WOULD STILL BE TALKING ABOUT RATE

01:33:06 CUTTINGS WITH THE FACT WE ARE HERE, NO ONE IS EXPECTING JUNE.

01:33:09 EVERYONE THINK SEPTEMBER WILL BE HARD TO PULL OFF.

01:33:11 I THINK IT IS A FASCINATING MOMENT. JONATHAN:

01:33:15 HOW MANY DECIMAL POINTS IS IT LOOKING TO?

01:33:23 >> THE FED IS LOOKING AT THE TRANSLATION OF CPI AND PPI TO

01:33:28 CORE PCE AND WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A SOLID ESTIMATE OF WHAT

01:33:32 PCE IS GOING TO BE YET WE WILL GET THAT AFTER PPI TODAY. LISA:

01:33:35 I WONDER ABOUT HOW MUCH PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT THE POTENTIAL

01:33:40 FOR A FEDERAL RESERVE TO MAKE A POLICY ERA BASED ON THE

01:33:44 POLITICAL CALENDAR. ESSENTIALLY THEY HAVE THE SAME

01:33:46 CONVICTION THEY HAD EARLIER ABOUT THE ECONOMIC BACKDROP AND

01:33:50 IT'S HIGHLY INCONVENIENT TO CUT RATES AT A TIME WHEN INFLATION

01:33:51 IS HOTTER THAN EXPECTED. AND YOU HAVE NORTH 300,000 JOBS

01:33:56 CLAIM.

01:34:03 >> I WOULD ARGUE THE NEGATIVE IMPACT FROM MONETARY POLICY

01:34:05 ALREADY OCCURRED AND THAT WAS IN THE FORM OF THE DECEMBER

01:34:06 RATE.

01:34:12 POWELL WANTED TO GET AHEAD OF THE PRESIDENTIAL CYCLE,

01:34:15 SOCIALIZE THE IDEA OF CUTTING RATES AND THAT'S WHY WE RALLIED

01:34:17 INTO THE END OF THE YEAR AND THE FED HAS BEEN WALKING THAT

01:34:18 BACK.

01:34:25 >> WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HOW THAT -- HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK

01:34:28 THAT HAS BEEN FUELING WHAT WE SAW YESTERDAY VERSUS THE SIDE

01:34:32 STORY TO THE WHOLE THING.

01:34:36 >> I THINK IT'S THE RESILIENCE OF THE LABOR MARKET THAT'S

01:34:39 REALLY DRIVING THE SUPER COURT MEASURE INFLATION.

01:34:44 WE HAD THREE RELATIVELY STRONG AVERAGE HOURLY EARNING PRINCE

01:34:48 DURING THE FIRST QUARTER AND YES THE LOFTY VALUATIONS IN THE

01:34:52 EQUITY MARKET MATTERED, THE COMPARATIVE STABILITY IN THE

01:34:55 HOUSING MARKET MATTERS AS WELL BECAUSE IT CAN TO BE SO THE

01:34:57 WEALTH EFFECT BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY IF WE HAVE A 3.8%

01:35:01 UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IT'S DIFFICULT NOT TO SEE SOME

01:35:04 DEGREE OF INFLATION ON AN ARGUABLY SUSTAINABLE BASIS.

01:35:07 ANNMARIE: GIVEN THE POTENTIAL WE SEE MORE

01:35:11 SUSTAINABLE INFLATION ON THIS BASIS, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE JOB

01:35:14 MARKET I CAN'T GET OVER MORE PEOPLE WORKING MORE THAN ONE

01:35:17 JOB TO KEEP UP WITH PAYING THEIR BILLS.

01:35:20 IF THAT KIND OF DETERIORATION WORRIES THE FED. IAN:

01:35:27 WE TEND TO SEE THAT DYNAMIC DEVELOP AT THE END OF A CYCLE.

01:35:31 IT'S SIMILAR TO THE WAY WE OFTEN SEE A DIVERGENCE BETWEEN

01:35:35 THE AND ESTABLISHMENT SURVEYS WHEN THINGS ARE ABOUT TO TURN.

01:35:38 I WOULD BE VERY SURPRISED WE HAVEN'T SEEN A MORE SIGNIFICANT

01:35:43 CORRECTION TOWARDS A HIGHER EMPLOYMENT RATE AND A WEAKER

01:35:44 JOB'S OVERALL. JONATHAN: IS THIS A SCREAMING BUY NOW.

01:35:51 IAN: IT'S GETTING TO THE POINT OF

01:35:53 BEING A SCREAMING BUY. WE DID THE CLIENT SURVEY LAST

01:35:56 WEEK. THIS WAS AHEAD OF THE PAYROLLS

01:36:02 NUMBER AND THE AVERAGE RESPONSE SAID IT WOULD BE INTERESTING --

01:36:06 PEOPLE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN HAVING TREASURIES AT ROUGHLY

01:36:10 465 IF WE DID THAT SURVEY NOW I IMAGINE THAT WOULD BE HIGHER.

01:36:13 JONATHAN: PEOPLE SAY THERE'S A POINT

01:36:17 WHERE THEY WANT TO BUY AND THE TREASURY MARKET START SELLING

01:36:23 OFF THEY RUN AMOK. IAN:

01:36:25 I THINK PEOPLE HAVE A SPREAD FROM WHERE WE CURRENTLY STAND

01:36:28 WHERE THEY WOULD GET REALLY EXCITED.

01:36:33 IT ALWAYS SEEMS TO ROLL A BIT HIGHER.

01:36:37 >> IF THE FED DOES NOT CUT RATES IN JUNE DOES THAT MAKE

01:36:39 YOU MORE BEARISH OR BULLISH ON THE MARKET? IAN:

01:36:45 IT MAKES ME MORE BULLISH ON THE LONG END BECAUSE THE REALITY IS

01:36:47 AS LONG AS THE FED'S HOLDING THAT 2% INFLATION TARGET THEY

01:36:52 MIGHT FIND THEMSELVES IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY HAVE TO

01:36:56 CAUSE A RECESSION OR MORE MATERIAL SLOWDOWN TO GET

01:37:00 INFLATION BACK TO 2% SO IT'S A BIT COUNTERINTUITIVE BECAUSE

01:37:01 EVERYONE IS NOW IN THE NO LANDING OR HOT LANDING CAMP.

01:37:05 THIS COMPLICATES THINGS FOR THE FED. JONATHAN:

01:37:11 LET'S FINISH ON LANGUAGE IF WE CAN.

01:37:14 THEY'VE REPEATEDLY SAID IT'S TOO EARLY TO KNOW IF IT'S MORE

01:37:15 THAN JUST BUMPS.

01:37:22 >> I THINK THIS IS A MEANINGFUL CHANGE IN THE BROADER

01:37:23 INFLATIONARY. IT IS MORE THAN A BUMP BUT IT

01:37:27 IS -- DOES NOT MEAN THE FED HAS LOST CONTROL OF INFLATION.

01:37:29 >> GOOD TO SEE YOU AS ALWAYS.

01:37:36 FROM THIS BOND MARKET AN EXTRA 15 BASIS POINTS, AN EXTRA 20

01:37:37 BASIS POINTS IN FIXED INCOME. YOU WANT ANOTHER 20.

01:37:42 4.56 ON THE 10-YEAR. VERY CLOSE TO 5%.

01:37:51 COMING UP IN THE NEXT HOUR THE THIRD HOUR OF BLOOMBERG

01:37:53 SURVEILLANCE WE CATCH UP WITH JASON THOMAS OF CARLISLE,

01:37:57 LOOKING FOR THE EURO TO DROP BACK WE WILL SPEAK TO ROBERT IN

01:38:02 CITY THE ECB RATE DECISION ABOUT 20 MINUTES AWAY AND THEN

01:38:05 15 MINUTES AFTER THAT ON DECK

01:38:07 >> PPI AND JOBLESS CLAIMS WHICH WILL BE THE FINAL READ IN TERMS

01:38:11 OF UNDERSTANDING THE COMPONENTS FOR CORE PCE WHICH IS WHAT THE

01:38:14 FED LOOKS AT. WHAT WE JUST HEARD IS THIS WAS

01:38:15 A CLEAR PIVOT POINT. THIS WAS A SHIFT IN TERMS OF

01:38:19 WHAT THE FED CAN DO AND HAVE THE MARKETS PERCEIVING THAT.

01:38:23 THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO HEAR FROM THE FED PRESIDENT.

01:38:27 >> THE HIGHLIGHT MIGHT BE JOHN WILLIAMS. IF WE GET SOME

01:38:31 COMMENTS ON THAT INFLATION DATA FROM YESTERDAY.

01:38:35 IF YOU ARE JUST JOINING US WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM WE ARE

01:38:36 LOWER AGAIN. -0.5%. FROM NEW YORK THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

01:38:58 >> WHAT THE FED HAS DONE IS PUT UP OR PRESSURE ON MAIN STREET

01:39:00 USA.

01:39:01 >> MAY BE BUMP IS THE NEW TRANSITORY.

01:39:05 >> NO ONE'S TALKING ABOUT A RE-ACCELERATION OF GROWTH OR

01:39:08 RE-ACCELERATION IN INFLATION.

01:39:11 >> I THINK IT'S A FUNDAMENTALLY DISINFLATIONARY ECONOMY.

01:39:15 WE HEARD FROM MANY YEARS.

01:39:17 >> THIS IS A PROBLEM.

01:39:21 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE WITH JONATHAN

01:39:24 FERRO , LISA ABRAMOWICZ AND ANNMARIE HORDERN.

01:39:27 >> WE'RE A FEW WEEKS INTO Q2. FIRST TRADING DAY OF THE YEAR.

01:39:33 WE'RE GETTING IT SIX TO SEVEN RATE CUTS IN 2021.

01:39:38 -- HERE ARE THREE MONTHS LATER. BOND YIELDS ARE HIGHER BY MORE

01:39:42 THAN 70 BASIS POINTS. YESTERDAY WE GOT AN EXTRA 20.

01:39:47 DOUBLE-DIGIT MOVE THROUGHOUT THE CURVE AND HERE WE ARE

01:39:52 PRICING IN PLUS SEVEN -- NOT SEVEN, NOT SIX, BUT MAYBE TWO

01:39:55 OR NOTHING. LISA: PEOPLE FLIRTED WITH TRANSITORY

01:39:59 EARLY THIS YEAR. THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE ARE

01:40:04 LOOKING AT WITH THE FED THEY'VE NEVER TALKED ABOUT THIS.

01:40:08 THE MARKET TALKING ABOUT IMMACULATE DISINFLATION.

01:40:13 >> BUMPS IN THE ROAD REPEATEDLY. I THINK WITH QUOTE OF THE YEAR

01:40:21 SO FAR, BUMPS IN THE ROAD FOR THE NEW TRANSITORY.

01:40:24 MAYBE SHE'S GOT A POINT. ANNMARIE:

01:40:27 I WAS STRUCK BY WHAT IAN SAID. HOW UNCOMFORTABLE POLITICS

01:40:33 MIGHT BE OF THIS BECAUSE YOU

01:40:39 SEE THE MARKET PUSHING BACK IN SEPTEMBER, WHAT HE HAD TO SAY

01:40:41 WAS WITH THE FED DID IN DECEMBER AND THERE FED PIVOT

01:40:43 AND THE RALLY WE'VE SEEN IN THE EQUITY MARKET THAT WAS THE

01:40:46 ELECTION HYPE THAT POWELL SET THE TABLE FOR NOT THIS

01:40:51 POTENTIAL CUT A MONTH OR TWO BEFORE THE ELECTION.

01:40:53 MONETARY POLICY HAVING AN EFFECT.

01:40:57 >> THAT WORD, UNCOMFORTABLE.

01:41:03 30 MINUTES FROM NOW WE GET JOBLESS CLAIMS AND PPI.

01:41:07 15 MINUTES BEFORE THAT YOU GET AN ECB RATE DECISION.

01:41:11 YOU HEAR FROM PRESIDENT CHRISTINE LAGARDE AT THE

01:41:14 EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK AND WE TALK ABOUT WHAT UNCOMFORTABLE

01:41:15 LOOKS LIKE IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE.

01:41:23 IT'S DOLLAR-YEN TAKING UP 153 AND MAYBE BOJ CAN INTERVENE

01:41:25 BECAUSE IT GOES AGAINST THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE U.S.

01:41:28 ECONOMY AND THE FUNDAMENTALS OF FED RESERVE POLICY.

01:41:31 HOW UNCOMFORTABLE WILL SOME OF THE CENTRAL BANKS BE? LISA:

01:41:37 YOU KNOW IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE THE NEXT 45 MINUTES SITTING HERE.

01:41:40 LOOKING AT THIS ABOUT THE FX. JONATHAN: HOW DO YOU FEEL?

01:41:46 ANNMARIE: WHAT IF HE MISSES HIS TEE TIME

01:41:47 AT THE MASTERS. JONATHAN: DELAYED FROM THE WEATHER.

01:41:51 GOOD NEWS. CARRY ON. LISA: I'M THINKING TO MYSELF HOW MUCH

01:41:58 DOES IT ACTUALLY BENEFIT FOR SOME OF THE CENTRAL BANKS.

01:42:02 GOING BACK TO THE ECB AND THE EURO.

01:42:03 ON THE MARGINS NOT TOO MUCH. THEY CAN DIVERGE BUT JUST NOT

01:42:07 FOR VERY LONG. I WONDER HOW MUCH CHRISTINE

01:42:13 LAGARDE -- ANNMARIE: THE TOP CURRENCY DIPLOMAT

01:42:20 SAYING RECENT YEN MOVES ARE RAPID, DISORDERLY QUIT -- MOVES.

01:42:24 WON'T COMMENT WEATHER OVERNIGHT ARE EXCESSIVE.

01:42:27 EXCESSIVE MOVES COULD AFFECT THE ECONOMY.

01:42:35 CONTINUOUS ALMOST OBSESSIVENESS WHERE IS THAT IN THE SAND.

01:42:39 I'M NOT SURE IF WE WILL GET THAT KIND OF UNCOMFORTABLENESS

01:42:45 FROM CHRISTINE LAGARDE.

01:42:47 JONATHAN: BASICALLY SAYING THIS IS MORE

01:42:50 UNCOMFORTABLE FOR THE BOJ THAN IT IS FOR THE ECB.

01:42:54 ESSENTIALLY MAYBE THIS IS WHAT THEY WANT TO YOUR POINT.

01:42:58 THEY WANT A WEAKER EURO BECAUSE THE GROWTH COMPARED TO THE

01:43:01 UNITED STATES IS A VERY DIFFERENT STORY.

01:43:07 LISA: THE FACT THAT GERMANY IS THE

01:43:10 SICK DOG OF EUROPE RIGHT NOW AND WAS THE STRONGEST DOG.

01:43:16 DOES A LOT OF CHINA COMPETITION ESPECIALLY WITH INFLATION WHICH

01:43:18 DOES LEAD TO THE CURRENCY CHANNEL. JONATHAN:

01:43:23 EQUITY FUTURES ON THE S&P NEGATIVE BY 0.5%.

01:43:27 THE EURO A LITTLE BIT SOFTER. YIELDS UP AGAIN BY TWO BASIS

01:43:30 POINTS.

01:43:36 COMING UP WE WILL CATCH UP WITH JASON THOMAS.

01:43:42 JANE FOLEY REACTING TO THE ECB DECISION.

01:43:48 WE BEGIN WITH TOP STORY. DIMMING RATE CUT HOPES.

01:43:54 IT'S MORE THAN LIKELY RATES WOULD MOVE UP AND DOWN.

01:43:58 WITH THEIR GUIDANCE TOWARD RATE CUTS.

01:44:02 THAT ISN'T THE CASE FOR CUTS. JASON JOINS US NOW FOR MORE.

01:44:06 WONDERFUL TO GIVE YOU -- GIVE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE PROGRAM.

01:44:13 >> I THINK THE DISCOURSE NEEDS A CHANGE.

01:44:20 SINCE THE FOMC MEETING WE'VE RESERVED A MASSIVE EASING OF

01:44:21 FINANCIAL CONDITIONS. STOCKS UP BY 25% ON AVERAGE IN

01:44:26 THAT RALLY. 10 YEAR YIELDS FELL BY ONLY --

01:44:31 OVER 100 BASIS POINTS. AND ALSO CREDIT MARKETS.

01:44:37 IF YOU LOOK AT THE SPREADS AND HIGH-YIELD BONDS JUST OVER 300

01:44:41 BASIS POINTS WITHIN 50 TO 60 BASIS POINTS FOR THAT TIME

01:44:44 SERIES DATING BACK SINCE 1996. THIS RESPONSE IN FINANCIAL

01:44:51 CONDITIONS SINCE NOVEMBER IS REMINISCENT OF WHAT WE SAW WHEN

01:44:54 THE FED LAUNCHED ROUNDS OF QE IN THE PAST DECADE.

01:44:59 IT'S NOT THE BASE RATE WHICH HAS REMAINED UNCHANGED THAT IS

01:45:03 SO CENTRAL TO INFLATION DETERMINATION BUT THESE BROADER

01:45:04 FINANCIAL CONDITIONS. I THINK TODAY THE FED HAS TO

01:45:10 LOOK AT THIS DATA, A LOOK AT THE SERVICES SECTOR THE LOOKS

01:45:15 TO BE BURSTING AT THE SEAMS IT EXPERIENCES ENTERTAINMENT

01:45:19 SERVICES CONTINUES TO GROW. AND REALLY JUST CHANGE THIS

01:45:23 DISCOURSE. LOOKING FORWARD WE DON'T SEE

01:45:26 ANY RATE CUTS. AND THEY ALLOW FOR TIGHTENING

01:45:34 OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS THAT MAY PUT YOU IN A SITUATION WE

01:45:37 ARE FEELING MORE COMFORTABLE ON THE INFLATION FRONT.

01:45:45 JONATHAN: THE FED CHAIR SAYS WE ARE

01:45:46 SUFFICIENTLY RESTRICTIVE.

01:45:56 >> I THINK AS OF NOVEMBER THE FED SAID THEY DIDN'T NEED TO

01:45:58 HIKE FURTHER THIS FINANCIAL CONDITIONS A TITANS

01:46:02 SIGNIFICANTLY PRAYED THEY DID THE FEDS WORK FOR IT.

01:46:04 THAT WAS RIGHT AT THE TIME. WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHATEVER

01:46:10 METRIC ONE WANTS TO LOOK AT OR COLLECTION OF METRICS TO TRY

01:46:16 AND ASCERTAIN WHERE THEY STAND, IT'S HARD TO SAY FOR THE THREE

01:46:22 MONTHS OF THE YEAR IT'S NOT THE BASE RATE THAT MATTERS.

01:46:27 THE FED FUNDS RATE IS OVERNIGHT INTEREST RATE THAT'S APPLIED TO

01:46:29 ABOUT $85 BILLION OF TRANSACTIONS.

01:46:36 IT'S MEANINGLESS, IT'S ONLY THE EXTENT THE INSTRUMENTS, THE

01:46:40 BALANCE SHEET DEBATE -- BASE RATE INFLUENCE FINANCIAL

01:46:42 CONDITIONS. ON THAT SCORE YOU WOULD HAVE TO

01:46:46 CONCLUDE POLICY HAS BEEN TOO EASY TO HIT A 2% INFLATION

01:46:47 TARGET. THAT GETS INTO QUESTIONS ABOUT

01:46:53 IS THE FED EFFECTIVELY IMPLICITLY MOVING TO A HIGHER

01:46:58 TARGET IF THE DISCOURSE DOESN'T CHANGE I THINK THAT'S GOING TO

01:47:00 BE THE TAKEAWAY AMONG MANY MARKET PARTICIPANTS. LISA:

01:47:07 AS PEOPLE LOOK TO IT TWO TO 3% RANGE FOR THE POTENTIAL FOR

01:47:09 INFLATION. AS AN INVESTOR THOUGH YOU LOOK

01:47:11 AT HOW EASY FINANCIAL CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN DO YOU

01:47:17 PUSH AGAINST THAT, DO YOU SELL CREDIT AND AVOID THOSE AREAS

01:47:21 AND SAY THIS IS A FED THAT WANTS TO REMAIN ACCOMMODATIVE.

01:47:25 JASON: I THINK RUNNING THE ECONOMY HOT

01:47:28 MAY TURN OUT JUST FINE. THE ECONOMY IS PERFORMING VERY

01:47:32 WELL. I THINK THE RISK IN THE

01:47:39 SITUATION HOWEVER IS THE FEDERAL BUDGET DEFICIT AND WHAT

01:47:42 I MEAN BY THAT IS SOME MARKET PARTICIPANTS MAY INCLUDE DESK

01:47:46 CONCLUDE THEIR MOVING TO A HIGHER INFLATION TARGET IT'S

01:47:49 ACTUALLY SUCCUMBING TO FISCAL DOMINANCE.

01:47:53 BASED ON THE FUNDING NEEDS OF THE TREASURY.

01:47:59 SETTING POLICY ON THE NET INTEREST EXPENSE WHICH HAS BEEN

01:48:00 GROWING EXCLUSIVELY. IF THAT HAPPENS IF THAT'S A

01:48:07 BROADLY SHARED SENTIMENT, A WATCH OUT FOR LONG-TERM BOND

01:48:10 YIELDS BECAUSE OF A CENTRAL BANK IS SETTING POLICY ON THE

01:48:16 BASIS OF WHAT THE FISCAL NEEDS TO FUND ITSELF, IT LOSES

01:48:17 CONTROL OF THE PRICE LEVEL. THESE ARE TAIL RISKS, THIS IS

01:48:22 NOT ANYONE'S CENTRAL FORECAST BUT AS THESE PERCEPTIONS GAIN

01:48:28 HOLD YOU COULD BE LOOKING AT MUCH HIGHER LONG-TERM BOND

01:48:29 YIELDS AND MUCH STEEPER CURVE.

01:48:37 FOR ME IN THIS ENVIRONMENT I LIKE FORMULATE LOANS, CLO'S IN

01:48:41 A WAY YOU ARE PROFITING FROM RIDING OUT THESE BASE RATES.

01:48:47 THIS IDEA OF NEEDING TO BUY BONDS BECAUSE THEY GO TO 4.5%

01:48:50 OR 6% AT SOME INVESTMENT GRADES. THAT'S PROVEN TO BE A BAD TRADE

01:48:57 AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF EMBEDDED DURATION RISK THAT

01:48:59 PEOPLE NEED TO BE COGNIZANT OF.

01:49:07 LISA: WHAT'S YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF

01:49:10 WHAT BENCHMARK RATE BECOMES RESTRICTIVE FOR THESE COMPANIES?

01:49:12 AT WHAT POINT THESE HIGHER YIELDS REALLY DO POSE ESSENTIAL

01:49:16 RISKS TO THEIR BUSINESS MODELS? JASON:

01:49:21 I DO NOT SEE EXISTENTIAL RISK BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS OVER

01:49:26 THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS CERTAINLY MUCH OF 2023 THE

01:49:29 EXPECTATIONS OF RATE CUTS AND THE EXPECTATION THAT THE

01:49:33 TERMINAL RATE IS STILL MUCH LOWER THAN CURRENT LEVELS OF

01:49:36 THE FED FUNDS RATE ALLOW A LOT OF BUSINESSES TO SWAP TWO-YEAR,

01:49:40 THREE YEAR TO FIVE-YEAR AND LOWER THEIR BORROWING COUNTS.

01:49:44 IT'S NOT THE OVERNIGHT RATE THAT MATTERS.

01:49:48 IF YOU HAVE A FLAT CURVE OF 5.3% OR AN UPWARDS LOOKING

01:49:52 CURVE FROM 5.3% THAT WOULD BE MORE THAN SUFFICIENT.

01:49:56 IN MY VIEW TO BRING INFLATION DOWN TO TARGET.

01:49:59 IT'S NOT THE BASE RATE THAT MATTERS HERE.

01:50:05 SECONDLY I WOULD SAY ONE OF THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER INTEREST

01:50:08 RATES THAT'S BEEN INTERESTING IS INCREASING FINANCE COSTS SO

01:50:13 IT'S DIFFERENT FOR BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS TO BUY HOMES BUT

01:50:14 ALSO DURABLE GOODS AND RENOVATIONS.

01:50:20 THE SPENDING HAS ACTUALLY MOVED TO EXPERIENCES, TO SERVICES.

01:50:23 THIS IS WHERE THE INFLATION IS. IF YOU LOOK AT HOUSEHOLD

01:50:29 BALANCE SHEETS ABOUT 85% OF THE DEBT IS FIXED RATE.

01:50:34 OF COURSE THAT'S A MORTGAGES. THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE

01:50:40 BEING PAID ON THAT STOCK OF MORTGAGES IS STILL ONLY 3.8%.

01:50:45 SO YOU HAVE THE RATE HIKES HAVE DONE NOTHING TO INDENT

01:50:48 HOUSEHOLD CASH FLOW SO HOUSEHOLDS ON AVERAGE ARE ABLE

01:50:50 TO SPEND WITH A DEGREE OF COMPENSATION.

01:50:54 BECAUSE OF HIGHER FINANCE COST IT'S MEANT THAT'S BEEN

01:50:55 REDIRECTED INTO EXPERIENCES. JONATHAN:

01:51:00 APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND HOPEFULLY WE DO THIS AGAIN SOON.

01:51:02 JASON THOMAS THEY ON THIS MARKET. NOT BEING SUFFICIENTLY

01:51:07 RESTRICTIVE BUT INSUFFICIENTLY RESTRICTIVE.

01:51:10 EQUITIES ON THE S&P -0.5%. THE ECB RATE DECISION.

01:51:43 JONATHAN: THE DECISION FROM THE EUROPEAN

01:51:45 CENTRAL BANK JUST SECONDS AWAY. BEGINNING WITH EQUITIES AND WE

01:51:49 WORK AWAY THROUGH THE BOND AND FINISH ON THE EURO.

01:51:56 EQUITY FUTURES NEGATIVE BY 0.5% DOWN ANOTHER ONE THIRD OF 1% ON

01:51:57 THE NASDAQ 100.

01:52:04 THIS COURSE FOLLOWING, 4.5 620.

01:52:12 HIT DAMAGED, HIT HARD THE EURO NEGATIVE.

01:52:18 INTEREST RATES ON THE REFINANCING RATE.

01:52:25 THE FACILITY IS EXPECTED, THE DEPOSIT FACILITY INTEREST RATE

01:52:28 COMING IN AT 4% AGAINST A MEDIAN ESTIMATE OF 4% AND THE

01:52:29 PREVIOUS NUMBER AS WELL. GREAT EXPECTATIONS THE ECB WILL

01:52:33 MAKE A MOVE SOMETIME SOON. THAT COULD COME IN JUNE.

01:52:39 THE QUESTION OF THE LAST 24 HOURS IS WHETHER THE CPI DATA

01:52:43 STATESIDE WOULD CHANGE THE STORY GIVEN THE STRENGTH OF THE

01:52:45 U.S. DOLLAR AND THE WEAKNESS IN THE

01:52:46 SINGLE CURRENCY. A BUNCH OF HEADLINES TO WORK

01:52:48 THROUGH. LISA:

01:52:54 LOOKING AT THE IDEA THEY PLAN TO FOCUS ON THE IDEA OF

01:52:57 REDUCING INFLATION IN A TIMELY MANNER WHICH IS INTERESTING

01:53:00 GIVEN THAT THERE SEEM TO BE MORE FLEXIBILITY IN THE TIME WE

01:53:03 HEARD FROM FED CHAIR POWELL ALSO TALKING ABOUT HOW THEY DO

01:53:06 SEE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS WHEN IT COMES TO THE DISINFLATION IN

01:53:12 THE REGION AND THEY ARE GOING TO CONTINUE APPLYING

01:53:15 FLEXIBILITY ON THE INVESTMENT. TO ME THE IDEA OF SUFFICIENTLY

01:53:20 RESTRICTIVE BEING A KEY TERM THEY KEEP USING AND THEY WANT

01:53:26 TO HAVE A TIMELY REDUCTION IN INFLATION PUSHES AGAINST THIS

01:53:28 IDEA OF BEING MORE DOVISH IN THE FACE OF WHAT SOME PEOPLE

01:53:32 WERE TALKING ABOUT MIGHT BE AN OPENING FOR THEM. JONATHAN:

01:53:39 THIS QUOTE HERE FROM THE ECB IN THEIR STATEMENT FINANCING

01:53:41 CONDITIONS REMAIN RESTRICTIVE AND THE PAST INTEREST RATE

01:53:46 INCREASES REMAIN ON DEMAND BUT DOMESTIC PRICE PRESSURES ARE

01:53:49 STRONG AND THE KEY SERVICES PRICE INFLATION IS HIGH.

01:53:53 CATCHING UP WITH LIZZY BURDEN IN FRANKFURT.

01:53:56 A LOT OF ATTENTION ON THIS ECB NEWS CONFERENCE LATER ON THIS

01:54:00 MORNING AT ABOUT 30 MINUTES TIME GIVEN THERE IS

01:54:03 EXPECTATIONS THAT THEY WILL CUT INTEREST RATES IN JUNE WHEN

01:54:04 MAYBE THE FEDERAL RESERVE CANNOT. WHAT DO YOU SEE IN

01:54:07 COMMUNICATION THIS MORNING?

01:54:10 >> JUST LOOKING AT THIS DECISION IT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE

01:54:15 EXPECTED IN THE SENSE THEY STOOD HERE WHEN THEY'VE TOLD US

01:54:17 WHY THEY SAID INFLATION CONTINUES TO FALL MOST OF THE

01:54:22 MEASURES OF UNDERLYING INFLATION ARE EASING.

01:54:25 THE RATE LEVELS MAKING SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO

01:54:29 REACHING THAT 2% LEVEL BUT YOU'VE SEEN SERVICES INFLATION

01:54:33 STICKY BUT GROWTH PROSPECTS IN THE EURO AREA IN PROVING.

01:54:36 IT GIVES THEM ROOM TO WAIT A LITTLE BIT LONGER.

01:54:40 THEY HAVE SAID THEY WANTED TO WAIT FOR THAT RAGE DATA IN JUNE.

01:54:48 WE ARE LISTENING TO CHRISTINE LAGARDE ON HER TONE AS TO THE

01:54:50 PATH FOR RATES BEYOND JUNE BECAUSE ECONOMISTS WERE

01:54:53 EXPECTING QUARTER RATE CUTS EACH QUARTER OFF THE BACK OF

01:54:58 THIS.

01:54:59 YOU'VE SEEN TRADERS CHANGE THEIR PRICING HOLDING ECB RATE

01:55:01 THAT'S STEADY. SO THAT'S THE REACTION IN

01:55:06 MARKETS.

01:55:09 >> THIS LINE FROM THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK NOT PRE-COMMITTING

01:55:12 TO A PARTICULAR RATE PATH. DIFFERENT IS A COMMUNE CASING

01:55:17 FROM THE ECB OR HOW SIMILAR IS IT TO THE COVERAGE YOU DO OVER

01:55:20 THE BANK OF ENGLAND HOW SIMILAR ARE THOSE TWO STORIES OF THE

01:55:24 MOMENT.

01:55:25 >> NOBODY WANTS TO BE THE UNRELIABLE BOYFRIEND.

01:55:30 FROM THE ECB THERE'S NOTHING EXPLICIT HERE AND THAT'S KIND

01:55:33 OF WHAT WE EXPECTED THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO WANT TO MAKE

01:55:37 COMMITMENTS BEFORE SEEING THAT CRUCIAL WAGE DATA AND IT'S THE

01:55:40 SAME PICTURE IN THE U.K. FROM THE BANK OF ENGLAND

01:55:44 BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH UNCERTAINTY IN THE ECONOMIC

01:55:46 OUTLOOK AT THE MOMENT. BUT THE BIG QUESTION FOR THE

01:55:49 ECB IS WHEN THE DIVERGENCE FROM THE FED LOOKS INEVITABLE WHAT

01:55:53 ABOUT EURO WEAKNESS. WARNING ABOUT EURO-DOLLAR

01:55:58 PARITY WILL CHRISTINE LAGARDE IN THIS PRESS CONFERENCE

01:56:01 MENTIONED THAT VOLATILITY IN THE EXCHANGE RATE AND THE

01:56:05 POTENTIAL TO FEED BACK INTO EUROZONE INFLATION.

01:56:10 >> IT'S INTERESTING YOU MENTION FOREIGN EXCHANGE.

01:56:12 WE SEE THE EURO SOFTEN A BIT VERSUS THE DOLLAR AFTER THIS

01:56:16 RELEASE WHICH WAS SURPRISING GIVEN THE RISK OF THEM HAVING A

01:56:19 CUT AT THIS PARTICULAR MEETING HAS BEEN TAKEN OFF THE TABLE.

01:56:22 IS THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN BE VIEWED AS PARTICULARLY HAWKISH

01:56:23 IN THIS RELEASE.

01:56:28 >> WE DID NOT EXPECT TO SEE A CUT TODAY.

01:56:33 ONLY ONE OF 62 ECONOMISTS THAT BLOOMBERG SURVEYED EXPECTED TO

01:56:36 SEE A CUT TODAY SO THAT IN ITSELF IS NOT DOVISH.

01:56:41 JUST LOOKING AT IT GIVEN TRADERS ARE NOT CHANGING THEIR

01:56:45 PRICING OFF THE BACK OF IT THAT IS IT IT DOESN'T SEEM

01:56:48 ESPECIALLY HAWKISH YET BUT THIS IS WHY CHRISTINE LAGARDE WILL

01:56:51 HAVE TO MIND HER TONE ESPECIALLY CAREFULLY IN THIS

01:56:52 PRESS CONFERENCE TODAY.

01:56:56 >> GREAT TO SEE YOU OVER IN FRANKFURT, GERMANY.

01:56:59 BREAKING DOWN THE ECB RATE DECISION.

01:57:04 THIS MORNING A LOT OF PEOPLE GOING O
