00:05 Rates right now are coming down. The only question is when.

00:10 And I do believe that it's going to be pushed out further.

00:13 We are pushing back against the market's pricing, swift immediate rate cuts

00:18 starting in the first quarter. There is this very substantial

00:22 disinflationary process in place. It's just a question of whether or not

00:25 you get an uptick over the next several months or volatility backdrop, both in

00:28 terms of the macro conditions, including inflation and the market, I think should

00:32 be part of the assumption. People still worry about inflation and

00:36 there's just not a lot of data to support the idea that there is any.

00:39 This is Bloomberg Surveillance. With Jonathan Ferro, Lisa Abramowitz and

00:43 Annmarie Horden BURNETT live from New York City this morning.

00:47 Good morning. Good morning.

00:48 For our audience worldwide, this is Bloomberg Surveillance alongside lisa

00:52 brown gets together with Annmarie Horden.

00:54 I'm Jonathan Ferro your equity market on a six day winning streak on the s&p 500,

00:58 extending the longest winning streak of the year so far, heading towards three

01:03 consecutive weeks of gains on the S&P 500 this morning, slightly softer by

01:06 0.2%. The good news keeps coming.

01:09 Secretary Yellen says inflation is well under control.

01:12 Stock markets are at all time highs and hope in the White House says this can

01:16 continue. We can get to the White House in one

01:18 second. But the markets are embracing as Bob

01:20 Michael Costa of Jp morgan economic nirvana, because essentially you're

01:23 getting your disinflation and you're getting your growth.

01:25 Here's your cake. Eat it, too.

01:26 And basically the market is embracing that.

01:28 Even when we get certain disappointments in earnings that sort of create

01:32 idiosyncratic ruffles, everybody else moves on.

01:34 Can we get to the White House now? Go ahead.

01:36 Let's do that. Better story to tell for President Biden

01:38 and Secretary Yellen. Will it continue?

01:40 Yeah, absolutely. A better story to tell.

01:42 The idea that that potentially we can have a soft landing, something the White

01:45 House is really going to lean into. But look at the polls on my screen right

01:49 now, Real Clear Politics, all of them. Economists, YouGov, President Biden, job

01:53 approval, negative six on the spread, Harvard Harris -20 on their spread.

01:58 ABC News Ipsos -25 has the message yet to resonate with the American voters.

02:03 You've asked the right question is the calendar on their side this year to

02:07 guess to look out for? We'll catch up with the Treasury

02:08 Department a little bit later on this morning.

02:10 We'll talk to Mohamed El-Erian in 2 hours time as well.

02:13 His message is pretty clear. He thinks they've got to do a better job

02:17 at explaining this economy and explain the exceptionalism, the US

02:20 exceptionalism in the global economy. Right now, Europe's struggling, China is

02:24 struggling as well. The US is kind of out there on its own

02:27 doing okay. The story has been a little bit hard to

02:30 tell given the two year, year over year comp or two year over year comp has been

02:35 really inflationary, right? Have they got enough time where people

02:38 are kind of settling into a better economic environment?

02:41 That's the reason why hasn't been resonating, right?

02:43 How clearly can they tell a story that's somewhat complicated and very much still

02:48 under discussion by many in the market as well?

02:49 So that's the economics and the financial markets as well.

02:51 We're talking about credit spreads a little bit later.

02:53 I want to talk about a single name before we run away from the market too

02:56 quickly. Intel.

02:57 Intel is having a really difficult time at a pre market with down about 11% in

03:01 early trading. Decent results.

03:03 They were okay, just overshadowed by a really poor outlook.

03:06 Wells Fargo, Lisa calling it soft guidance.

03:09 Truist saying the guide was well below consensus.

03:11 We're down 11%. So intel is an interesting one because

03:14 they've got to compete with the likes of Nvidia.

03:16 They're talking about personal computing, they're competing with all of

03:19 the other suppliers to the cloud and other kind of invoke technology.

03:23 What I find interesting, we got two misses on companies that are tech sort

03:27 of considered, right? We heard that from Tesla and now we have

03:30 this from Intel. At what point do idiosyncratic stories

03:33 become a trend? Or if we got into a new phase where

03:35 idiosyncratic remains idiosyncratic and people just look at the specific

03:38 company, It's an Intel problem, not a broader tech problem.

03:41 We'll get to Intel a little bit later. Let's turn to the broader financial

03:43 markets for you. Equity futures on the S&P 500 shaping up

03:46 as follows. On the S&P, we look a little something

03:49 like this, negative by 0.16% going against the grain of the last six days.

03:53 Six day winning streak yields lower by a single basis point for 1066 BMO on a ten

03:59 year. The Federal Reserve just around the

04:01 corner. Yeah ECB Christine Lagarde pulled a Jay

04:03 Powell yesterday she had an opportunity to push back against the market.

04:06 She didn't and I think that that's what you're seeing currently currently in the

04:09 bond space where people are saying, all right, so the Fed's basically going to

04:12 cut rates. The ECB is not far behind with now 50

04:15 basis points of rate cuts priced in in that region.

04:17 In June, the Federal Reserve not too far away.

04:19 I can't wait for your review of the Fed, never mind the ECB, given how you talked

04:23 about present. Lagarde coming into that news conference

04:25 yesterday, was I wrong? You were right.

04:27 Okay. And you know you were right anyway,

04:29 which is why we're so excited for your review of Chairman Powell just ahead of

04:33 that decision. More exciting next Wednesday, more

04:34 excited maybe than you were about Lagarde, I think.

04:37 Okay. Coming up this hour, plenty of

04:38 excitement over the next 60 minutes on this program.

04:41 Cameron Dawson of New Wealth on the six day winning streak for US stocks.

04:45 Bloomberg's at Ludlow on Intel's warning for chip makers and Greg Valliere of ATF

04:49 Investments on President Biden ramping up his campaign for the November

04:53 election. We begin with our top story, a six day

04:56 winning streak for stocks. Cameron Dawson, CEO of New Wealth.

04:59 Warning of a stronger economy doesn't guarantee better earnings.

05:03 You would hope that a stronger economy would turn.

05:04 It's like two stronger earnings. But this didn't happen in 2023.

05:08 GDP was much stronger than expected, but EPS estimates didn't budge.

05:13 Cameron Dawson joins us now from Albany. Cameron, good morning.

05:15 Let's go straight there. The difference that you see between what

05:18 stock prices are doing and where EPS revisions are coming.

05:21 There has been a very interesting divergence brewing over the last four

05:25 months, which is that you have seen multiples expand significantly now at

05:29 20.1 times forward. And yet that entire time you've slowly

05:33 seen eating away EPS estimates for 24 and 25, 2024 estimates are down about a

05:39 half a percent. That's not enough to be a big warning

05:43 sign to be concerned about. But you would hope that given all this

05:46 soft landing nirvana, that you would start to see a little bit of uplift in

05:50 EPS estimates. I think the reason you're not seeing it

05:53 is because EPS estimates are already fairly optimistic.

05:56 They were already pricing in 10% plus for this year, 11% for 2025.

06:02 So you're starting from a high base, which just means that the equity market

06:05 really never believed we were going to have a hard landing.

06:08 Let's go. Over the last year where the EPS growth

06:11 has been big tank, Magnificent Seven. It's not like if just run away like the

06:14 late 1990s. This is real earnings growth in places

06:17 like India and from the big names as well matter to do you expect them to do

06:22 the heavy lifting again in 2024. It's such an important point.

06:25 It's kind of like, as James Carville said, it's the economy, stupid, It's

06:28 earnings, stupid. You can explain all of the

06:31 outperformance in sector leadership by looking at earnings revisions.

06:35 So if you take something like growth versus value that captures the tech

06:38 versus the old economy, trade. Growth estimates are up 5% over the last

06:43 six months, but value estimates are down 3%.

06:46 So what you have is this really divergent market as well under the

06:50 surface where the only sectors that have had positive earnings revisions in the

06:53 last six months are tech and com services.

06:56 So those are the sectors that, of course, have led the market.

06:59 But there has been this feeling that maybe they've gotten too expensive, that

07:01 people have brought forward all of the growth.

07:03 And any growth that smaller companies may get from the same technological

07:06 advancements has been completely left behind.

07:09 Do you buy into any of that or is that too kind of highfalutin and theoretical

07:12 for you? No, I think it's a really good point,

07:14 which is that we have to balance the fact that the names that have

07:18 outperformed so much that are having these earnings revisions are crowded and

07:22 expensive, and eventually that will come.

07:25 There will come a point where that becomes a headwind.

07:27 But there's so much momentum right now. You're sort of in the let your winners

07:31 ride camp. But I think we have to be very prudent

07:33 to acknowledge that when something gets crowded and expensive, you're in the the

07:37 area for downside surprise. Look at homebuilders this week.

07:41 I know it's not at all the same, but homebuilders were impervious to

07:44 volatility and bad news. And then all of a sudden it hit them

07:49 where you had this big downside volatility.

07:51 So I think maybe a day like that for tech could change the trend.

07:54 But for now, momentum to the upside, I guess.

07:56 What does it mean to be prudent at a time where everyone's talking about an

08:00 equal risk recession, an equal risk, no landing, right.

08:03 I mean, how do you sort of hedge that? I think what you need to do is you need

08:07 to reduce your exposure to heavily interest rate sensitive parts of the

08:11 market, because if you're taking a bet on things like low quality small caps or

08:15 low lower quality parts of the market, it is a leveraged play on interest

08:19 rates. And so if interest rates move against

08:21 you, you see all that outperformance start to unwind.

08:25 Our preference is to look for companies with strong balance sheets.

08:27 We still think that we're late cycle, which means you need companies that can

08:31 navigate an uncertain economic environment and have the balance sheet

08:34 to withstand what could be downside surprises, maybe not in 2024, but

08:38 certainly possible in 25. White House has come out and all but

08:41 certain basically said we're going to have a soft landing.

08:43 You're calling it a strange landing. What makes it so strange?

08:47 What makes it strange is that we are coming out of such an extraordinary

08:51 period of disruptions to data from the pandemic, as well as policy distortions.

08:56 If we think about what's happening on the fiscal policy side of things with a

08:59 $1.8 trillion deficit, at the same time that the bond market with five and a

09:05 half cuts is effectively pricing in the largest easing cycle in a non

09:09 recessionary period in 40 years. So you're getting this double stimulus

09:14 from fiscal and monetary policy, But then you have to throw in all of these

09:18 things about Treasury liquidity into it. The data is going to be confusing.

09:22 It's going to be dislocated. It'll it'll definitely disagree with

09:25 itself, which will make this so hard to determine what direction we're going in.

09:29 So you have to keep your head on a swivel.

09:31 How are you thinking about the market leading up to November?

09:34 I think that we should be very cautious about thematic baskets.

09:38 I used to cover the industrial stocks and I remember that going into the 2016

09:43 election, everybody was very bullish on industrials because of a big

09:46 infrastructure bill. What's very interesting is that

09:49 industrials peaked as a sector relative. This market two weeks after the 2016

09:54 election and is still have not overcome that peak.

09:57 So be very aware of something about thematic baskets.

10:00 Do you think it's going to get more difficult for large multinationals given

10:04 what might be around The? corner.

10:05 I think it is certainly possible. I think we're all keeping this in mind

10:09 about globalization. Your deep globalization just means that

10:12 the margin uplift that you've been able to count on for the past 30 years

10:16 possibly is going to have greater headwinds if you're having to reshore

10:20 capacity, that's capacity that comes at a higher marginal cost, which just

10:25 raises the question of these estimates where ever higher margins in the S&P

10:30 500, which there is a record for 24 and a record for 2025, already baked into

10:35 forecasts. Is that attainable in a world of

10:37 globalization? As we get into the heart of earnings

10:39 season, what are the sort of red flags that you're looking for that could

10:43 really be a signal of something deeper, either in a sector or for a broader

10:47 market? For us, it's pricing power.

10:49 Pricing power has been so very important to top line growth over the last couple

10:54 of years and has been the source of a lot of margin expansion.

10:57 When you grow your revenues a lot, you get great incremental margins that flows

11:01 through down to the bottom line. If we start to see fading pricing power,

11:06 that will stand very much in contrast to the revenue top line estimates for the

11:10 S&P, which have an acceleration in revenue baked in.

11:14 So watch for pricing power watch guidance around how much pricing power

11:17 companies have left a camera. Stick with us.

11:19 Cameron Dawson there of New Age brand. I'm fascinated by what lessons Saunders

11:23 had to say at Charles Schwab yesterday. Just on this point of maybe

11:25 multinationals being challenged, the small caps start to pick up around this

11:29 story of the Trump 10% tariff. That's one to watch.

11:32 If you believe in American exceptionalism.

11:34 This concept that the US economy can keep going without some sort of

11:38 international involvement, well, why not immunize yourself from that potential

11:42 risk? And oh yeah, these are also underpriced

11:44 relative to where everything else is priced.

11:46 And the what was coming up then that's what we've got to figure out.

11:49 We're going to be supporting national champions.

11:50 I'm thinking of one industry specifically.

11:52 I'm thinking of the automakers more and more at the moment on that front.

11:56 Although we heard from Gary Cohn, right. He basically just shrugged it off.

11:59 He was like, yeah, I'll get it. You know, if I were there, I would just

12:01 tell him. But here's the thing.

12:03 At a certain point you have to think the threat of it is going to create some

12:06 sort of isolationist kind of policies. And we heard that at Davos from a lot of

12:10 people who are saying the policies haven't changed all that much.

12:13 And a lot of companies have already had to reckon with an increasing kind of

12:16 protectionist policy from the US. More on this story a little bit later.

12:19 Equity futures on the S&P 500 negative here by 0.2%.

12:23 Let's get you an update on stories elsewhere this morning.

12:25 Here's your Bloomberg race with you. Hire a hacker.

12:27 Sayonara. Hi, John.

12:28 The Biden administration has frozen approvals for new licenses to export

12:32 LNG. Officials say they need time to

12:35 scrutinize how shipments affect the climate, the economy and national

12:39 security. The halt will likely disrupt plans for

12:42 billions of dollars in projects. President Biden saying, quote, This

12:46 pause on new LNG approvals sees the climate crisis for what it is the

12:51 existential threat of our time. And China's central bank has unveiled

12:56 plans for targeted stimulus meant to guide money into specific sectors.

13:01 The PBOC made the move after surprising investors this week with a bigger than

13:06 expected cut to its reserve requirement ratio.

13:09 Economists see the central bank following up by steering credit into

13:13 select areas and making a handful of trims to the amounts of cash banks must

13:18 hold. Jp morgan is shaking up its top ranks.

13:23 CEO Jamie Dimon is moving to key executives Jennifer Piepszak and Troy

13:28 Rohrbach into new roles as co-CEOs of its expanded commercial and investment

13:33 bank. The Switch comes halfway through

13:35 Diamond's five year retention package, giving both executives more experience

13:40 as he prepares potential successors. That's too Bloomberg brief John.

13:44 Yeah, Kyra, thank you. Up next on the program, the ECB behind

13:47 us, the Fed. Up next, the consensus around the table

13:52 of the Governing Council was that it was premature to discuss rate cuts.

13:57 And in addition to that, I typically stand by my comments.

14:01 More on that in just a moment. That's coming up next.

14:04 You're watching Bloomberg Surveillance live from New York City this morning.

14:07 Good morning.

14:24 Live from New York City this morning. Good morning.

14:26 Here's the price action. Six day winning streak on the S&P 500.

14:29 Here's the bump in the road, 0.2% negative on the S&P.

14:33 We've been spoiled primo on the equity market over the last week.

14:36 Yeah, but if you look beneath the hood, it's Intel is tracking everything down,

14:39 and otherwise everything's doing great. Honestly, this sort of Nirvana story,

14:42 everyone leaning into soft landing seems to be the theory.

14:44 And that is sort of the feeling of the moment, whether it can last.

14:48 And we've been saying this and then I get all this pushback.

14:50 Sure, you say that. Well, I mean, you have to question.

14:52 But Michael J.P. Morgan Asset Management talking about

14:55 economic nirvana a little bit later this morning under surveillance this morning,

14:58 the ECB behind us, the Fed up mixed. The consensus around the table of the

15:05 Governing Council was that it was premature to discuss rate cuts.

15:13 And in addition to that, I typically stand by my comments.

15:17 We had to continue to be data dependent. So rather than being fixated on any kind

15:23 of particular calendar which would be being data dependent, we reaffirmed our

15:28 data dependency. It's the latest this morning.

15:31 Try this ramping up rate cut that's after look at reaffirms that easing

15:34 could start mid-year. Traders pricing a 90% chance of cutting

15:38 in April. The decision due out next Wednesday.

15:40 Bloomberg economics expecting officials to also hold rates steady.

15:43 Lisa but writing quote we think the stage is set for a cut at the march

15:48 meeting and that disinflation nirvana basically paving the way for them.

15:51 I have to say, Christine Legarde definitely sounded a lot like Jay

15:55 Powell. She had an opportunity to push back.

15:57 Everyone was waiting for her to push back.

15:59 She well, not so much. Listen to this.

16:01 Frederic Duclos, Out of Pity Wealth Management, weighed in, saying Christine

16:04 Lagarde could have pushed back more strongly against market pricing, betting

16:08 on more than two quarter point rate cuts by June that she decided not to is an

16:12 important signal in itself. It seems as if central bankers are not

16:16 worried about an easing in financial conditions and they're all systems go

16:21 ready to cut rates in a sign of discipline.

16:23 And you call this passively dovish, Is that what we'd call this?

16:27 Well, that's fantastic. Yes, that's the reason why markets have

16:30 run away with themselves a little bit more.

16:32 Yeah. Basically, she's just allowing them to

16:33 do it. It was there were dovish signs within

16:35 the hood of the otherwise somewhat somnolent.

16:38 I was upset. You know why?

16:40 Yes. Not a single Trump question at my news

16:42 conference, which I find unbelievable. So allow me to address this.

16:45 If you're in the Governing Council meeting yesterday, why why didn't they

16:48 ask about this? I don't know.

16:50 I don't know. I think reporters probably want to get

16:52 the nuance of her thoughts on monetary policy.

16:54 Also, that survey came out, which she did address, and Christine Lagarde said

16:57 I'm irrelevant. And she's basically saying she stands by

17:02 lifting up her staff. But it was a weird way of saying that

17:06 her lead when they put her leadership basically on blast.

17:09 But I was surprised. No reporter said not just what do you

17:11 think about Trump? We all know what she thinks about Trump,

17:14 but is it inappropriate for you to weigh in on U.S.

17:16 politics? Let's get the thoughts of our sell in

17:18 your state club ahead of ethics strategy.

17:20 RBC Ousted. Don't worry, I'm not going there.

17:22 First, I'm going to be talking about ECB policy that that's sound like an ECB

17:26 that was going to cut rates anytime soon.

17:30 I mean, it's clear that they're now in the mode where they're looking for the

17:34 start date. The question is how much more data they

17:37 need to see before they're confident that the time is right to start.

17:41 But as you said earlier, they're not pushing back on market pricing.

17:45 They did push back several times last year.

17:48 This meeting was different. And I think that in itself is a signal.

17:51 Christina Card also didn't give any guidance as to which data was most

17:55 important to really determine whether they could cut rates.

17:58 Is this basically the idea that they're going to feel it out?

18:00 And if the feeling feels right, they'll just do it?

18:04 And I think it's a little bit more than that because a number of people were

18:07 focusing on the wage data that will come out for Q1, and they wouldn't really

18:11 have that until late April and then small wage data on June six.

18:15 So, you know, the narrative was will, maybe they can't cut until June because

18:19 they need to see all the data points. And I think she's trying to hedge

18:22 herself, you know, if the data continue to deteriorate and we had some pretty

18:25 bad PMIs yesterday, if things continue on that path, then they're allowing

18:30 themselves the room to cut earlier if needed.

18:32 And I think that's why she wasn't being very specific about what data they're

18:36 looking at. Also, do you think that the ECB is going

18:38 to cut rates more steeply or more deeply than the Federal Reserve to this year

18:42 simply because the economic outlook is that much more suppressed?

18:47 I'm not so sure. And one of the reasons I have the saying

18:50 that is if you look at where the euro area is starting from, we had a pretty

18:55 weak year of growth in 2023 and actually going into 24, real incomes are going to

19:01 be a little bit firmer. The fact that inflation is coming down,

19:03 you can either focus on the fact that real rates are going up or you can focus

19:07 on the fact that real incomes are going up.

19:09 And I think the Fed's focused a little bit more on the former.

19:11 The ECB seemingly has focused a bit more on the latter, and that in itself should

19:16 not necessarily lead to strong growth, but at the very least support domestic

19:20 demand somewhat. We also know the ECB is monitoring

19:23 geopolitical risks. The most notable for Europe is what's

19:25 going on in the Red Sea. How do you assess that potential

19:28 inflation to consumer goods, goods, given the fact that actually really

19:31 hasn't even moved oil prices? Right.

19:35 And I think what was really interesting is how Christine Lagarde responded to

19:39 those questions in the press conference. You know, she made a point of saying the

19:42 cost of shipping goods by sea is roughly one and a half percent just north of one

19:47 and a half percent of the overall total cost of goods sold.

19:50 So really playing down the impact that the moves we've seen so far could have.

19:55 You know, again, she drew the parallels to 2021, but noted how different that

20:00 situation was. It wasn't just freight costs.

20:02 It was also the capacity at ports to unload and load.

20:06 You know, it was a whole host of supply bottlenecks.

20:08 That's not what we're seeing at the moment.

20:10 Of course, if it continues, if it escalates up, it spills over into crude

20:13 prices, then clearly it creates an inflationary risk.

20:16 But she certainly didn't seem concerned based on what we've seen so far as to

20:20 how it is that with foreign exchange pushing all of that through the market,

20:23 the tension on the euro against the dollar, we closed last week close to

20:26 109. We're close in this week, close to 1.9.

20:30 So what's going to move this one? Well, you know, I've been pretty

20:34 bearish. You're a dollar for a pretty long time

20:36 now. At least three, four years and counting.

20:38 But I think what's really interesting is how the ECB plays out against the Fed.

20:43 And you asked me a week ago, I was really actually hoping we might get a

20:46 pretty hawkish ECB, and that would set up a potentially very interesting trade

20:50 where rates could converge between the US and the euro area and potentially

20:54 lead to some very interesting hedging flows and a lot of euro dollar buying.

20:58 Based on what we heard yesterday, that just looks a little bit harder to

21:01 achieve for this year. Now, it's still a risk that I'm watching

21:03 and that's, I think, something to keep on the agenda.

21:06 But, you know, as things stand, it's hard to argue that because it'd be

21:09 radical differences between the Fed and the ECB.

21:11 And if that's the case, then it does point to a far more rangebound euro

21:15 dollar. That's been a story of the last few

21:16 weeks as a thank you. It's good to see you as well in your

21:19 staff. And obviously Catherine Dawson, the

21:21 floor is yours. Let's figure this one out together, the

21:23 ECB versus the Federal Reserve and what it has to do with the market.

21:26 Yeah, well, they talk about being data dependent, but the data is so very

21:31 different between Europe and what the Fed is working with here in the US.

21:34 We think about the data. This week the Fed got a great upside

21:37 surprises to fourth quarter GDP data. But then you look at what Europe got,

21:41 which is that IFO business survey in Germany just showing abysmal outlooks

21:45 this week PMIs. So it really would support a more dovish

21:49 tone from the ECB because of how much weaker the data is in Europe versus the

21:54 US. We think a lot of that has to has come

21:57 from the diffusion of higher interest rates into the European economy because

22:01 they simply have a lot more short term interest rate exposure than what we have

22:05 in the US, where a lot of companies able to term out their debt.

22:08 Does it make you optimistic to invest in Europe, even over the US, simply because

22:12 they are seemingly a little bit more willing to cut and valuations are that

22:16 much lower? Being overweight, Europe has been the

22:19 Widowmaker trade year in, year out. Again and again.

22:22 We just have seen consistent D rating of non US stocks versus the US.

22:27 That's partially because of sector concentration.

22:30 There's so many more value type old economy sectors within Europe.

22:33 We are finding a lot of opportunity though to be selective within non-US

22:38 markets and I think that's the key, which is that don't buy the index, buy

22:42 companies that are trading at significant discounts to US peers, but

22:46 kind of a bind. Lying of Europe probably doesn't work.

22:48 If you look on a relative basis, the market is still in a very distinct

22:52 downtrend versus the US. So until that turns, it's likely a value

22:56 trap. I know you can't name the single names,

22:58 but can we talk about them? Can you describe them?

23:00 Are we talking about a Novo Nordisk? They rhyme with CMH.

23:04 I'm not going to the Ryman game. I'll just name them for you.

23:06 It's those are the kind of names we're talking about.

23:08 It starts with an A and ends with an SML.

23:12 Look at this. Yes, I picked it up.

23:16 So. So look, I think that there are

23:18 opportunities in retail, in semiconductors within the European

23:24 market, within healthcare as well. It's not about necessarily buying those

23:28 old economy banks or mining companies, for example.

23:31 And that's where the selectivity comes in.

23:33 Come on. It's good to see you can read Dawson

23:35 Avenue, which dealt with that one pretty well.

23:37 I think the ASX market's been an absolute snooze.

23:39 Laser has been talking about this for months.

23:41 Take the euro against the dollar. Last week we close at 1.98 this morning.

23:45 Want to wait 75? Wow.

23:47 Got to figure out the data. That's terrible compared to the United

23:50 States, which is still pretty resilient. And so at this point, I think everyone's

23:53 hoping that maybe you get some clear directional trade emerging on a euro and

23:57 it's just not happening on my screen. I loved her frustration, not loved her

24:00 frustration, but you could feel the frustration.

24:03 She said, you know, I hope would I hoped maybe we would get something from her.

24:07 Instead, we just get the sort of wishy washy, I guess they're the same zone.

24:10 And here we are with basically a range bound hero.

24:12 Coming up on this program, Intel plunging after delivering a

24:16 disappointing forecast. That conversation is just around the

24:19 corner live from New York City this morning.

24:21 You're watching Bloomberg TV.

24:39 Live from New York City. Equities pulling back by 0.1% on the S&P

24:43 500. Here's a snapshot of financial markets.

24:45 Equity futures negative on the Nasdaq by 0.5.

24:48 That's the outperformance again, on a Russell Laser.

24:51 The small caps up by 0.55. How much is this just an intel story,

24:55 Right. Basically that's dragging down all the

24:56 tech names and all the Russell 2000 names or thinking, okay, if you're going

24:59 to start cutting rates well to the races.

25:01 And that seems to be the feeling that we've really heard from a lot of our

25:04 guests. The entire conversation just moments

25:06 away. Here's a snapshot of bonds for you.

25:08 Two year, ten year, 30 year yields look a little something like this in the

25:12 Treasury market, unchanged on a ten year for 1143 on a two year four 3097 date a

25:18 decent yesterday, Lisa. Yet the whole curve just came in.

25:21 Well the data was decent. It was perfect actually.

25:24 It was both better than expected growth in the fourth quarter than every analyst

25:28 out there, but also greater disinflation or the sort of disinflationary trend.

25:32 Yeah. Just to pause for one second, what

25:34 Cameron Dawson said there was so interesting about pricing power.

25:37 If companies have pricing power, that means that inflation goes back up.

25:40 If they don't, well, that's good for the economy.

25:43 But is that good for the companies? Because then their margins start to

25:45 compress. So we always say the economy is not the

25:48 market. And how much is that going to move in

25:50 the opposite direction this year? Who has the pricing power and where?

25:54 Let's finish on this. And the fixed market, the euro, who

25:56 needs sleeping pills when you've got euro dollar one away, 70 for that

26:00 currency pair positive five back quarter of 1% and almost totally unchanged.

26:04 Lisa, on the way so far. And it sounds like from our silliness,

26:07 this is basically what we can expect for the foreseeable future.

26:09 She was looking for downside. This is not what she wanted to say.

26:12 But yeah, rangebound Euro has been a story so far.

26:14 How can you really decide who's going to have the upper hand in terms of who cuts

26:17 first and all of that when basically they're saying the same thing?

26:20 And right now, you know, there's nothing really changing on either side to change

26:24 the narrative. The dollar index just a little bit

26:25 weaker under Savannah this morning itself stories the U.S.

26:29 pulling further ahead of China after better than expected GDP growth to round

26:32 out 2023. In nominal terms, the U.S.

26:35 economy grew 6.3% compared to china's 4.6 last year.

26:40 China's central bank signaling even more stimulus as growth worries continue.

26:44 This includes a new credit market for certain sectors, a cut to reserve

26:48 requirements and a possible rescue package for the stock market all in the

26:52 past week. It makes this goes to the US

26:54 exceptionalism. The Mohamed El-Erian going to talk about

26:56 a little bit later this morning. Yeah, absolutely.

26:58 China is still suffering from those draconian COVID era policies and they've

27:03 yet to come out of that. It's hitting on the stock market.

27:06 A lot of it has to do with the property slump and it's just a complete

27:08 divergence of what everyone was expecting.

27:11 Everybody is expecting China to be able to ramp up and it hasn't failed to

27:14 happen, which is the reason why you're seeing the divergence in the stock

27:16 markets last week. This is coming from TD Securities.

27:20 China's equity inflows inflows into China.

27:23 China equities from foreign investors hit the highest since July 2015.

27:27 Basically, they've gotten so underpriced that people are looking at this and

27:31 saying, what do I have to lose? And so at this point, yes.

27:33 Are investible. Yes, terrible.

27:35 Yes, they have unpredictability. But at a certain point, people want to

27:38 pick up that is before the bulldozer. So even if it necessarily is good, it

27:41 come eventually. You know, it seems like an entry point

27:44 where Mohammed catches up with this a little bit later when we focus on the

27:46 economy. I think to his point on the United

27:48 States, the fact that we're here in America relative to where Europeans and

27:52 what China's going, it's kind of amazing that you haven't heard more from the

27:55 White House about this. They've had several criticisms about the

27:59 stimulus packages that they passed when they came into power.

28:02 It's hard to believe would be here where we are currently relative to Europe and

28:07 China, without them 100%, especially because everyone's talking about the

28:11 massive cash that consumers have. A lot of the expectations in the analyst

28:15 reports that I read after GDP came out is that it's going to continue.

28:18 And why? Because people still have cash, because

28:20 not only do they still have savings, but now they're earning real wages that are

28:23 positive. These are stories they could tell.

28:26 We're not hearing it in a cohesive way. You're hearing more calls.

28:30 Get out there. Yeah, absolutely.

28:32 And as we go towards the election, to your point, Jonathan, they haven't

28:35 really told that story. Biden is out on the campaign trail

28:38 trying to He was in Wisconsin yesterday excuse me, in Wisconsin, Lake Superior.

28:43 He was going to Minnesota to talk about $1 billion bridge, that hard

28:47 infrastructure money, that package that they got done that remember, the prior

28:50 administration kept saying it's going to be infrastructure week.

28:52 We Infrastructure Week. They actually got it done.

28:54 And right now leading up to election, they're going to try to sell it.

28:56 Wally Adeyemo out of the Treasury is going to join us in about 2 hours time.

28:59 Look out for that conversation. Let's talk about the shake up at Jp

29:02 morgan preparing a possible line of succession for CEO Jamie Dimon, Jennifer

29:07 Piepszak and Troy Rover moving into senior roles as co-CEOs of the

29:12 commercial and investment bank Marianne Lake, who has worked alongside Piepszak

29:16 leading the Consumer and community bank, will get some control of that segment.

29:20 Dan Pinto will now focus on a broader role as president.

29:24 Lisa, we said a few times, not the shakeup.

29:26 Every time we get a shake up, we have the same conversation.

29:28 Is he going is he going? He's about halfway through his five year

29:31 tenure. Dan Pinto seems to be getting a lot of

29:33 the power. Is he going to have a more forward

29:35 facing kind of role is he looking for? For a role in government.

29:38 I'm talking to Jamie Diamond, not necessarily ten Pinto.

29:41 These are all valid questions. I'm not going to necessarily weigh in.

29:44 This is the calls I got from some Republicans.

29:46 I saw you were in Davos. Jamie Diamond comes out and says, well,

29:50 Trump was right on some things. Look at Naito.

29:52 Is he trying to ingratiate himself with the Trump campaign?

29:55 Is he trying to maybe becomes treasury secretary?

29:58 I said, I'm not sure, but potentially that's a better tax deal.

30:02 We've played this game how many times? I know how many times.

30:04 Yeah, it's countless. And I hear you.

30:06 Yes. On the tax situation, if you can divert

30:08 $2 billion worth of stock tax free and it's an option you might terrible might

30:12 be interested in. Let's get to LVMH shares looks like this

30:14 this morning searching defined a slowdown in luxury goods.

30:17 The company beating estimates with revenue growing 10% to round out the

30:21 final quarter of 2023. The boost coming thanks to an increase

30:24 in sales of handbags like Louis Vuitton and the champagne spirits sales also

30:29 coming in better than estimates. The news giving a lift to luxury peers.

30:33 Carrington Moncler the news out of the likes of Burberry in the last couple of

30:37 weeks hasn't been good at all so as much about a story yeah, maybe just sort of

30:42 more selective in terms of the mix of products and also who they're catering

30:45 to. And we've been talking about this and

30:47 you've been really great on sort of the buy now pay later trend and how that

30:51 really was good for a certain sort of entry level luxury.

30:55 I think LVMH maybe has a bit more of the people with all of the wealth amassed

30:59 who want to buy champagne, pop it open and celebrate.

31:02 If you're in Paris, the saying is all roads lead to Arnault.

31:05 Every corner there's either a Sephora, a Dior, Louis Vuitton.

31:09 Then you also have the distillery and some of the alcohol products.

31:13 They have something for everyone, also including Belmont Hotels.

31:16 So they're really in a category of their own when it comes to luxury space.

31:19 If you're in Paris and the Chinese in Paris stand out stat in the morning for

31:22 me, fourth quarter number of Chinese customers to its French stores was 30%

31:27 below 2019, 30% below 2019. Is that ever coming back?

31:32 Well, I guess we heard from the CEO of Trip.com.

31:36 And here's a question. She was saying there's that desire, but

31:39 there isn't the visa situation. Is that true or is there not necessarily

31:42 as much desire because internal consumer spending in China has not been that

31:47 strong? It's a decent question.

31:49 Can they move on without it? And that seems to be maybe what we're

31:51 seeing in some of the earnings as this stock is surging jumped by almost 12%.

31:55 Intel is plunging in pre-market trading. The Chipmaker's first quarter outlook

31:59 coming in much weaker than estimates. It sounds expected a fall about $1

32:03 billion short of estimates, a signal the once dominant semiconductor company is

32:08 losing ground in the lucrative data chip market.

32:10 Bloomberg's Ed Ludlow. From the West Coast to the East Coast

32:13 joins us this morning. Morning.

32:15 Yeah, good morning, John. Look, whatever the story is for the

32:17 semiconductor sector, be a rebound in end, markets coming off the bottom or an

32:22 expanding addressable market for air chips or a government backed on shoring

32:27 of this industry. Intel just didn't do enough to show

32:30 investors that it's in the race. The stock is down 11% in pre putting it

32:34 on track for its biggest drop since the end of October.

32:36 There's only so much patience investors have and this is a turnaround plan

32:40 that's been in motion for quite a long time.

32:42 And you ask at what point are you going to turn around?

32:44 Well, let's talk about it right now. How difficult is it to turn around a

32:47 supertanker if you're Pat Gelsinger? So it's very difficult for for a very

32:50 specific reason right now from an investors perspective, but also from an

32:55 end customers perspective. There's only one game in town for the

32:58 most important market, which is cloud, and that game is in video.

33:01 The 100 soon to be the 200 or 200 grasshopper.

33:05 And there isn't enough evidence that whatever they're offering on the CPU

33:09 side, but also the legacy business and data centers, data centers need all

33:12 kinds of chips, including CPU's, that growth just wasn't there against their

33:17 previous guidance. And so the market is asking, well, hold

33:21 on, you're not winning on the basics and you're not showing us the deals,

33:24 concrete deals on the GPU. So going forward, and remember that

33:27 Intel's also got another plan, which is to take on TSMC and Samsung.

33:31 Well, that's why I wanted to go with this.

33:32 Do we have any sense of whether they've locked in any deals with, say, Amazon or

33:37 Apple or any of the other major tech names to manufacture their chips?

33:42 No, no, we don't. And what they said is we have $10

33:46 Billion of lifetime deals. But as you guys know, if you drop a name

33:50 into a conversation, it can sometimes give you some weight.

33:52 When I flew out here, my wife said, Oh, you're going on TV.

33:55 I didn't say I'm not. I'm going on TV.

33:57 I'm going on Bloomberg Surveillance. And that's a funny analogy, but it's

34:00 what the market wants to hear. Stop giving us a number that could be

34:05 future orders or backlog catalog and tell us who that name is.

34:08 There was a critical piece of news 24 hours ago, which is a deal with Taiwan's

34:12 UMC. But it's really important to note that

34:14 while that is a capacity deal on the foundry side, for us, it's based on

34:19 depreciating assets in Arizona that are obsolete, not the cutting edge of

34:24 manufacturing. Well done.

34:25 You can come back. That was a very good.

34:27 But I will say though, when you talk about when you talk about, you know,

34:31 building potential chips for other companies and competing with TSMC, we

34:35 talk about policy. If you build it, they will.

34:38 And Intel's gotten a lot of money and will get a lot of money to build some of

34:41 these foundries in the southwest of the U.S..

34:45 Is it going to be worth it? Are they going to be doing anything

34:47 there? Traditionally, these are highly cyclical

34:50 end markets. Right.

34:51 And the risk is that you build up all this capacity only leading to long term

34:55 glut in supply. Right.

34:57 And the difference this time and you know, this goes to the reporting we've

35:00 done around Sam Altman really worried about the future supply of chips.

35:04 Is that the addressable market for accelerators things that chips are going

35:08 to stay centers to power air function is just infinite.

35:11 You know everyone is upgrading what they think the dollar volume will be in 2027

35:16 or the demand from a unit perspective in 2030.

35:19 And that does give the Bulls, at least in Intel's case, some some positivity.

35:24 But the whole bull thesis is predicated on that idea that Intel is going to be

35:28 in the race and they're just not giving evidence now.

35:31 And therein lies the problem of the turnaround story.

35:33 I thought governments are going to help them.

35:35 What's happened to all that money? Where is it?

35:36 So what I'm hearing from sources is that the CHIPS Act is fantastic, but in real

35:40 terms, you don't just get a check in the mail or a wire from the US government.

35:44 Accessing the capital is very hard and it's also multifaceted.

35:48 You know, Pat Gelsinger talks about this smart capital approach.

35:52 You take money from your balance sheet, you take money from the government, and

35:55 you get a strategic investor. Keep an eye on the strategic investor

35:58 part going forward, but waiting to receive it and then acting on it takes

36:02 time. Meanwhile, this is just the first of a

36:04 lot of the chip makers that are going to be coming to market in video coming in

36:08 later February. How much is this an idiosyncratic intel

36:11 story and how much are their notes of maybe something?

36:14 It's a bit broader here. So clearly there's going to be an impact

36:16 on the Nasdaq 100 or index level today in the moment.

36:19 But it's idiosyncratic. And you know, the story for me and I

36:23 take Tesla into account on this is where do you want to find EPS growth?

36:27 You find it within video. Strip out Tesla and it's a magnificent

36:31 six. And the only other place you can look

36:33 for it is the utility sector, which I don't cover.

36:35 So this standalone decline of 11% is isolated Intel.

36:40 Take TSMC numbers from Taiwan, take Texas.

36:44 It's a mixed picture still on how end markets are recovering.

36:47 But basically I still the only story in town.

36:50 Investors are willing to back that story.

36:52 But in the bottom line and the top line from a volume growth perspective, it

36:55 looks very good and this was great. It's good to catch up as always and

36:58 don't die there. Look at the moves we're seeing in the

37:00 pre-market. I want to compare and contrast this

37:02 pre-market and move to year over year. Pre-market intel is down about 10%.

37:06 It's pulling down the rest of the chip makers promo over the year.

37:09 Look at these numbers over the last 12 months or so.

37:12 Phenomenal. So Intel is up $0.65.

37:15 All right. Nvidia's up 211,

37:19 Advanced Micro Devices up 140, Qualcomm up just 15%.

37:24 There are clear winners, standout winners in this segment over the last 12

37:27 months. Jim Breyer Capital actually says it

37:30 should be a magnificent eight and AMD should be in there as well.

37:32 But it's the point of what we're seeing with Nvidia.

37:35 They're going to be reporting on February 21st.

37:37 And the theme with Nvidia is get all of your expectations, inflate them and then

37:42 they're going to blow those out of the water because what they've done with

37:44 earnings has been tremendous. This has been the Nvidia rally.

37:47 Everything else is just trying to catch up with it.

37:50 Must-watch conversation a little bit later.

37:52 Pat Gelsinger, the Intel CEO, Bloomberg Technology a little bit later with Ed

37:57 Ludlow. And in Caroline Hyde financial markets

38:00 look a little bit like this. This morning on the S&P 500, we are

38:03 negative by 0.15%. Let's get a full market shake for you

38:07 and look at equities, bonds and foreign exchange, starting with what's happening

38:10 in equities in the equity market. We're down about 0.15% in the bond

38:14 market. We are looking at about four 1143 yields

38:18 totally unchanged. And in foreign exchange, want to wait

38:21 73. Let's get you an update on stories

38:23 elsewhere this morning in case you interpret with your IRA hackers.

38:26 How are you? Hi, John.

38:27 Bank of America staff will share a roughly $800 million bonus pool of

38:32 restricted stock boosting pay to retain employees, even as the bank works to

38:37 keep a lid on expenses. About 97% of the global workforce is

38:42 eligible for the incentive, which goes to workers who earn as much as $500,000

38:47 in total annual pay. EU leaders are moving toward an

38:51 agreement next week to transfer some $54 billion in aid to Ukraine.

38:57 That's according to Latvia's president, Edgars Rinkevics.

39:01 I do hope that at the end of the day, all 27 members of the European Union

39:07 will be able to agree. I don't see any reason not to.

39:12 EU leaders return for a summit on February 1st to finalize the deal.

39:17 Apple is revamping its iOS Safari and App store offerings in the European

39:22 Union, aiming to appease regulators set to impose tough new antitrust rules.

39:27 The overhaul will support third party app stores and gaming services for the

39:32 first time. That's a Bloomberg brief.

39:33 Jon Uehara, thank you. Next on the program, President Biden.

39:37 Hitting the campaign trail. The experts from the time I got elected

39:41 were insisting that the recession was just around the corner.

39:44 Every month it was going to be a recession.

39:47 One recession growth ended accelerating into 2023.

39:51 What recession? That question up next.

39:53 You're watching Bloomberg Surveillance.

40:09 But he's very close to all time highs on the S&P 500.

40:12 Futures pulling back just a little bit were down 0.17% on the S&P, which are a

40:17 little bit lower by not even a basis point on the ten year for 1162

40:22 surveillance. This morning, President Biden hitting

40:25 the campaign trail. The experts from the time I got elected

40:29 were insisting that the recession was just around the corner.

40:32 Every month it was going to be a recession.

40:34 What recession? Growth ended accelerating into 2023

40:38 thanks to the American people. America now is the strongest growth, the

40:42 lowest inflation rate of any major economy in the world.

40:45 President Biden looking to capitalize on the robust fourth quarter GDP report.

40:48 The latest Pew poll showing a 9% increase in Americans who have a

40:52 positive view of the economy compared to a year ago.

40:55 But Biden's overall approval rating remaining at just 33%.

40:59 We'll be hearing a lot more from both Biden and Trump in the coming weeks as

41:01 they prepare for the South Carolina primary on February 24th.

41:05 Yeah, absolutely. The economy still ranking large,

41:07 Jonathan, when it comes to why voters want to go to the polls.

41:09 Greg Valliere is discussing this morning.

41:12 In his opinion piece, he's talking about how weighing in on how critical Biden

41:17 will be connecting to the economy for those voters.

41:19 A better economy with data to support the improvement is a big deal.

41:22 This looks like a Goldilocks economy. And if Americans finally begin to

41:25 believe that Biden has a decent chance. Let's get to Greg Valliere right now,

41:29 the chief US policy strategist, ETF Investments.

41:32 Greg, let's start there on the economy. Almaraz asked this a few times.

41:36 Is the calendar on his side the most we've seen in financial markets,

41:40 developments in the economy? Do you expect that to show up in the

41:43 polls any time soon? I think it's a good question, John.

41:46 I do think the calendar is on his side largely because had these great numbers

41:51 come out in June or July or August, it might have been too late.

41:55 But we're in January. And I think over the next two or three

41:59 months, there'll be more data confirming that we're not going to have a

42:02 recession. And that news comes at a pretty

42:05 fortuitous time for Biden. If the economy is doing better and

42:09 Americans do start to feel about feel better about the economy.

42:11 Greg, what happens next for that issue that's neck and neck for the economy and

42:16 top of voters minds, immigration? Because what we're hearing right now in

42:19 Congress that potentially a deal will not get done.

42:23 Well, I'd say, first of all, I am afraid that this if Joe Biden loses

42:27 re-election, I think it'll be because of immigration and he's not handled it

42:31 well. He doesn't really have a plan.

42:33 But this is compounded by the new speaker of the House, Johnson and of

42:38 course, Donald Trump, who are urging their colleagues not to act because they

42:43 don't want to give the Democrats a victory.

42:45 That's pretty cynical, even by Washington standards.

42:48 But I do think that we won't get a deal. The intriguing question is, can we get a

42:53 separate deal that gives money to Ukraine?

42:56 I do think that could happen. When it comes to Mitch McConnell,

42:59 there's a lot of reporting that behind close scenes.

43:01 He basically said capitulating on this deal that he was pushing for.

43:05 Is there any chance you see before November, potentially him being able to

43:09 rally the troops in the Senate and get something done on immigration, given all

43:13 the work that's been put into this and the Republicans might lose a

43:17 generational moment in time to get something done?

43:20 I know, but I think they view the election and a big election issue is

43:24 more important. I think the key variable here is going

43:28 to be do we get another big surge like we had before Christmas?

43:31 I mean, we were we were getting like 10,000 illegal immigrants a day before

43:37 Christmas. We had nearly 2 million last year.

43:40 If the numbers start to spike up again, then I think that would be an incentive

43:44 to do something. You mentioned Speaker Johnson.

43:47 He also has a really tight rope to walk when it comes to this potential tax

43:52 bill, as well as what that's going to be for child credits.

43:55 Does he put that on the floor? Well, it looks like he's not anxious to

43:59 get any kind of a deal. And the hard line conservatives in the

44:03 House don't want him to do anything. He's on a very short leash, as you know.

44:09 And I think that if we see Johnson not cooperating, he could suffer the same

44:14 fate as Kevin McCarthy. He could get the boot.

44:17 Given the fact that Trump has kind of gotten clearly the leadership position,

44:21 he is going to be probably the person running against Joe Biden.

44:25 Does it make it less likely they're going to get anything done in Congress,

44:28 that we're going to get some sort of government shutdown if there's going to

44:31 be this real fissure that just gets accelerated because any deal just simply

44:35 will help Biden look better, which could really harm potentially Donald Trump.

44:40 Yeah, I tell you, Lisa, I think it makes it more likely they will get nothing

44:44 done, that they won't want to give Biden any kind of a victory and they'll just

44:48 spin their wheels and do nothing. Again, as I said, I'm I'm pretty

44:53 cynical, but even by my standards, this is really cynical.

44:56 We started on the economy and we're going to be getting the core PCE

44:59 deflator later today, which is the key inflation metric.

45:02 What do you think this administration is getting wrong in messaging?

45:07 I think they probably don't appreciate the psychological damage that was done

45:12 to many Americans during and right after the pandemic.

45:16 I think they were quite nervous about their own

45:20 personal budgets.

45:23 And that hasn't changed yet. I think the the public is still of the

45:27 belief that the economy is not good. I was at a conference earlier this week

45:30 of retail investors and I was telling them I thought the economy was getting

45:34 better. Looking good.

45:35 They thought I was crazy. They thought I was delusional.

45:38 So there's still a strong opinion that the economy is not good, even though I

45:43 would argue the numbers lately have been quite encouraging.

45:46 It's hard when an inflation hits groceries to the degree that it has, and

45:50 that seems to be what people have been talking about.

45:52 We did hear from Janet Yellen yesterday at the Economic Club of Chicago, and she

45:56 was talking about prolonging some of the tax cuts from the Trump era.

46:01 What do you make of this sort of this concern about the deficit on one hand

46:04 and a need for fiscal responsibility and then talking up tax cuts in a new push

46:10 on the other? I think you could make a compelling

46:13 case. We should do nothing.

46:15 Everybody set and we got let's let's cut taxes.

46:17 Let's spend more. No, I don't think this economy needs any

46:21 more stimulus. I don't think it needs any more

46:23 spending. I don't think it needs any kind of big

46:27 new tax cut, maybe a small one on the child tax credit.

46:31 But I think if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

46:33 And I think there's a temptation in Washington to overreact to every

46:38 problem. Let's talk about what is broken, just to

46:40 wrap it up. Correct.

46:41 Plenty of things are broken, but this specifically the lessons from New

46:44 Hampshire and the ability of the former president to attract moderates.

46:48 Gregg, with that in mind, is he thinking about a running time that they can do

46:51 just that for him? I thought the the exit polls were really

46:56 significant on New Hampshire. It showed that a lot of moderates don't

47:00 like him. A lot of

47:03 suburbanites don't like him. He has very bad numbers.

47:06 And I think there's a compelling case that Trump cannot win the election just

47:11 with his base. He needs to expand that base.

47:14 And there was no sign that he did that in New Hampshire.

47:16 So when he says things like if you donate to Nikki Haley, we won't accept

47:20 your money. Gregg, what are the chances that he

47:22 actually will? He'll take their money.

47:25 I think that's that's that's a hollow threat.

47:28 But I think the relationship now between Haley and Trump is so poisoned that her

47:34 chances of being the vice presidential candidate are very slim.

47:37 Anyone in mind, Greg? Yeah.

47:39 Let's let's watch two people who I think are ambitious and may move.

47:43 One is J.D. Vance of Ohio.

47:45 The other is Elise Stefanik from upstate New York.

47:49 They're both passionate Trump supporters.

47:51 They're both articulate, they're young. And I think you're going to hear a lot

47:54 more about the two of them. Greg, good to hear from you.

47:57 Greg Valliere of ATF Investments. Thank you, sir.

47:59 The view from the administration coming up a little bit later this morning.

48:02 Wally Adeyemo of the U.S. Treasury joining us at 8 a.m.

48:06 Eastern Time as the lineup makes. Let's talk about the names that he just

48:10 threw out there. What you think?

48:11 Well, what's interesting is, as Greg said, those names are already within

48:15 Trump's base. So if he's looking at these numbers and

48:17 to Greg's point, New Hampshire showed he has issues with some suburbanites, he

48:20 has issues with independents, then you really need to go outside the 30% MAGA

48:25 stronghold and get someone that relates to them like Nikki Haley.

48:28 But potentially has the fuel already been blown up between those two in their

48:33 former relationship? That that's not possible.

48:35 But if you want to get the entire party, he needs to look elsewhere then Elise

48:39 Stefanik and J.D. Vance.

48:41 I've actually read Hillbilly Elegy, so it's yeah, it was an interesting book

48:45 and it sort of gave a window into where he's coming from.

48:48 You know what's funny about that book? The Liberal Left loved that book.

48:51 I know. And then he started getting into

48:54 politics and all of a sudden they don't like the guy anymore, which is it's kind

48:57 of funny. Well, it's a question of policy versus

48:59 story. And there's a question of how you bring

49:02 people together through a story that a lot of people could relate to.

49:05 Coming up in the next hour, Mohammed Al-Arian of Bloomberg Opinion, Sarah

49:08 Hannah, Vampire sax and words, they pretty impressive, Michaela.

49:11 Jp morgan Asset Management. They're all brilliant before anyone gets

49:13 jealous. All of that in the next hour from New

49:16 York City this morning. Good morning.

49:32 We're at a point now where we're expecting the broader market to really

49:35 do well. It may not be seeing the broadening out

49:38 if you just look at tech, but if you look at the dispersion that's happening

49:42 in the Magnificent Seven, it tells you that something is brewing for the

49:46 market. Still, this disinflationary trend, I

49:48 think, is the number one story. We've taken the punchbowl away and

49:51 markets haven't fully adjusted. This is just an unprecedented economy

49:55 and we have to manage a bunch of different factors.

49:57 This is Bloomberg Surveillance with Jonathan Ferro Lisa Abramowitz and

50:02 Annmarie Horden Hearn. We are on the longest winning streak

50:06 since mid-December on the S&P 500. Live from New York City this morning.

50:10 Good morning. Good morning for our audience worldwide,

50:12 this is Bloomberg Surveillance alongside Lisa abramowitz, together with Emory

50:16 Horton. I'm Jonathan Ferro your equity market on

50:18 the s&p 500, just a touch softer, lighter, lower, negative by 0.1%.

50:23 It's been all time high after all time high all week this week.

50:27 And it's not just the equity market, Lisa, it's the credit markets.

50:30 Basically everything rallying credit spreads globally now at the lowest

50:34 levels, going back two years. People basically call coalescing around

50:38 this idea of a soft landing. All of the data pointing to stronger

50:41 growth and more disinflation. The White House has been absolutely love

50:45 and get the president of the United States trolling everyone who called for

50:47 a recession. The Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen,

50:50 saying the bad part of the inflation story itself.

50:53 Is that going to translate into the polls for the year ahead?

50:56 We have to wait and see. So far, the polling that we've seen

50:59 Biden continue to get poor remarks when it comes to the economy.

51:02 Americans are not yet feeling this disinflationary scenario.

51:05 But again, the timeline might be on their side.

51:08 The Michigan Consumer Sentiment survey that was recently out, although that is

51:11 a little bit partisan, depending on, yes, Democrats or Republicans who think

51:13 about the economy, they answer where some of their political lines lie.

51:17 But the fact of the matter is Americans are starting to feeling a little bit

51:21 better. But can they sell this going into

51:22 November? I keep reflecting on a couple of

51:24 conversations I've had with Uber drivers, and I'm not going to base my

51:27 entire thesis on that. But one guy said, you know, $5, you used

51:31 to be able to go in the store and it would buy you something that you could

51:33 actually eat. And now it really can't in the same kind

51:37 of way in the city. And that's really problematic.

51:40 It's making him feel really negative. So people say, well, it'll just take

51:43 time for people to adjust to this. Is there enough time before November for

51:47 people to adjust to prices at higher levels than they were, say, in 2020?

51:51 This is the challenge of communicating this.

51:53 And I think you're absolutely right. For consumers, it's about the price

51:56 level. It's about the adjustment, the

51:57 cumulative inflation we've seen since 2020.

51:59 And we've talked about the scars of that.

52:01 What Diane Swonk said recently and we're all fans of Diane Swonk, you need this

52:04 labor market to stay pretty decent. You need wage growth to continue

52:07 climbing, you need time. To your point, the problem I've got with

52:11 economic data at the moment, least from it both on the same page about this, I

52:13 know so much of it is in conflict, so headline payrolls data looks good

52:17 beneath the surface, the breadth of the gains is really narrow.

52:20 Just a couple of industries. I think you see this in earnings too.

52:23 Let's take visa yesterday, compare it to, say, Capital One.

52:27 We both look at the same thing, Visa saying consumer spending remained

52:30 resilient. What stands out for Capital One?

52:32 I'll tell you, borrower was falling behind on the credit card and auto

52:35 loans. Which one do you think speaks to where

52:38 the American population is at the moment?

52:39 It's the one of LVMH versus Kmart. That is what we're talking about,

52:44 essentially, which is that people who have money will keep spending and be

52:48 able to pay for it. People have to borrow at 10% rates to

52:51 buy a car, are having trouble with underwater loans, paying it back.

52:55 And you're seeing that in the capital. One figures, not necessarily in the visa

52:58 figures. And these disparities point to a much

53:01 more complicated picture than simply the headline numbers.

53:03 We've seen that conflict. We haven't.

53:05 We support a price action for you this morning at least.

53:07 And good morning to all at home. The equity market, the S&P 500 negative

53:11 here by 0.1% into the bond market for 1143 on a ten year into the effects

53:16 market just in at around 129128 75 at least we heard from the ECB yesterday.

53:21 I wonder if the message is going to be any different from Chairman Powell on

53:24 the Fed next week. She was echoing Jay Powell from

53:26 December, which is essentially whatever the markets are saying, I don't usually

53:29 go back on them. She didn't push back.

53:31 She could have pushed back. And essentially now we have a 90%

53:33 pricing of an ECB rate cut come April, a 50 basis point rate cut to in total

53:39 being priced in by June. She Michelle says that summer is going

53:43 to come early because if Christine Lagarde continues to be data dependent,

53:46 as she says she is, then her date is going to have to change, going to have

53:50 to move forward potentially to the spring.

53:51 At least she's not going that just yet. What did she say yesterday?

53:54 I didn't talk about rate cuts today, but what I told you before still holds.

53:59 You talk about rate cuts. She says she stands by her words, but

54:01 also and we didn't cut the full version of that was a Bloomberg reporter asking

54:04 her and she said, but how you interpreted what I told your TV channel

54:08 is a little bit different than what I said, but I stand by what I said, which

54:12 was likely. Okay, super helpful.

54:14 That simple. How for over the next 60 minutes, the

54:17 program looks like this. Mohammed and Erin, if Bloomberg Opinion

54:20 and Queens College Cambridge on the Brazilian US economy.

54:23 Sarah one of our sex Saxon words with stocks closing in on a third week of

54:26 gains and JPMorgan's Bob Michael on the Fed's path forward.

54:31 We begin with our top story this morning.

54:33 Better than expected data boosting optimism for a soft landing.

54:38 Just last week, we saw the biggest jump in 30 years in how positive consumers

54:44 are feeling about the economy. Things are finally beginning and

54:47 thinking. We passed a lot of really good

54:48 legislation we knew was going to take time for it to begin to take hold.

54:52 But it's taking hold now and turning the economy around.

54:55 But Mohamed El-Erian of Queens College, Cambridge, writing early this month, the

54:59 Biden administration cannot simply rely on lower inflation to alleviate voters

55:03 concerns about its economic management. It needs to communicate more effectively

55:07 The exceptionalism of US economic performance.

55:10 Mohammed, I'm pleased to say, joins us now for more.

55:13 Mohamed, good morning. I think you're right on the money now

55:16 that this is a big, big issue, the communication in the White House right

55:19 now. Can you give us what you think they

55:21 should do in the weeks and months to come?

55:24 Sure, John, Thanks for having me on. They have to translate

55:28 things that they have achieved and that the public doesn't appreciate.

55:32 Amazing job growth, very strong economy. Remember, even Bloomberg said 100%

55:39 probability of recession in 2023. Instead, we've ended up with a 5% third

55:46 quarter, a 3.3% fourth quarter. Remarkable stock markets record high and

55:54 is the only advanced economy that is investing in the drivers of tomorrow's

56:00 growth. That is a long list of achievements.

56:03 And yet, if you ask the person in the street and we talked about the polls,

56:08 they think that the administration has mishandled the economy.

56:12 There's two reasons for that. One is inflation.

56:13 You're absolutely right. People think in terms of price level.

56:17 So for them, when you say we are winning the war over inflation, they think that

56:22 that means prices will come down, not that the weight of price increases will

56:26 come down. And the second thing is they haven't

56:28 communicated in a manner that translate this to the everyday.

56:32 So you need a lot more consistent communication and you need it simplified

56:38 so that the person in the street understands why.

56:41 Not only are they better off than they've been before, but the prospects

56:45 is that we have new growth engines coming in.

56:47 I'd also argue, Mohammed, you need the labor market to hold up for the rest of

56:50 this year to allow the scars of inflation to actually heal.

56:54 Do you think the easing of financial conditions over the last few months

56:57 let's go from the end of October. Mohamed, you think that's sufficient to

57:01 delay any weakness in the labor market? I don't because a lot of this is like

57:06 pushing on a string. Corporates will be able to refinance at

57:10 lower rates. Mortgages are slightly better, but the

57:15 reality is that the structural issues, I mean, that is the big risk for the

57:18 administration is that the economy slows this year because some of the drivers of

57:24 last year's growth are no longer there, including high savings.

57:28 And secondly, inflation stops going down.

57:31 You know, John, I've said we are in the sweet spot of the inflation reduction

57:36 right now. It's going to get tougher going forward.

57:39 And we've already seen from Europe that is not out of the question that not only

57:44 does inflation stabilize, but once in a while you get the weight going up and

57:48 that would really impact perceptions. The White House is so excited to lean

57:53 into this, Mohamed. Soft, very soft landing expectation.

57:57 The timeline may be on their side, but when you look out to November, where are

58:00 the vulnerabilities to that soft landing?

58:04 So the vulnerability on the other one is what the external world is imposing on

58:09 the U.S. It is getting harder to grow in this in

58:12 this global environment. We have disruptions of supply chains.

58:17 We have cost pressures in the pipeline. We have delays in shipments.

58:21 All of that has a material impact to the consumer is going to be under more

58:28 pressure. You've talked about debt levels in the

58:31 previous. Our savings have come down.

58:34 We no longer have the pandemic savings being utilized to the extent it was

58:39 before. So there's a real risk that growth slows

58:43 to the 1 to 1 and a half percent level with downside that we may slip into a

58:49 negative quarter. And then thirdly, inflation.

58:53 We need inflation to keep on going down. Tomorrow, the market expects that it

58:59 will do so in a much more orderly way than I think will materialize,

59:02 unfortunately. I'm struck by something I keep saying

59:05 about this. Cameron Dawson said Muhammad or she was

59:07 saying she's checking for pricing power among a lot of companies that are going

59:11 to be reporting earnings if they don't have that much pricing power.

59:14 That's great news for disinflation. That's very bad news for their bottom

59:18 line in terms of just their margins. How much is this sweet spot for

59:22 disinflation? Not necessarily a Goldilocks spot for a

59:26 lot of the stocks that are getting beat up simply because it means margin

59:29 compression down the line. Oh, I mean, seeing it.

59:32 I mean, you know, my big theme for this year's dispersion and just look, today

59:38 we've realizing that not all tech is tech and not all luxury is luxury.

59:42 That is what the results are telling you between Intel, on the one hand for tech

59:48 and on the other hand for LVMH, what you're seeing is growing

59:54 dispersion. And some companies will have pricing

59:57 power, others will not. And we are going to see this dispersion

01:00:00 on the market right now is betting on a very aggressive rate cycle.

01:00:07 Allowing for everything to go up, because that is the experience since the

01:00:11 global financial crisis. As long as the Fed loosens, everybody

01:00:15 benefits. I think this time around we're going to

01:00:17 see a lot more dispersion than we've seen before.

01:00:20 Deutsche Bank says we'll get a reality check later this year.

01:00:23 They're looking for, say, 10% downside on the S&P 500.

01:00:26 It's not particularly unusual you expect in that kind of reality check, Mohammed,

01:00:30 any time soon for markets, given where stocks are at all time highs.

01:00:33 Spreads. Global credit spreads incredibly tight.

01:00:37 You know, John, I'm not in the business of predicting when that happens and when

01:00:41 it happens and where people have been wrong in the past, including last year,

01:00:48 is ignoring the technicals and the technicals right now are incredibly

01:00:52 favorable. So the big question for me is what

01:00:54 breaks favorable technically, By that I mean, there's still money in the

01:00:58 sidelines that can be put to work. So dips will be viewed as buying

01:01:03 opportunities for a while. No, John, the thing I worry about most

01:01:06 is the sense that growth is going to disappoint with a downward risk.

01:01:13 The balance of risk on the downside. This comes against the universal romance

01:01:18 with the softness of all soft landing. And then secondly, a recognition that

01:01:24 the Fed is not going to validate what's being priced in right now in terms of

01:01:28 cuts. Chairman Powell, next week, what kind of

01:01:30 message you expect and the one we heard from Williams a few days after he spoke

01:01:33 in December, or the one we had from Powell at the December news conference.

01:01:39 Or the one we'll hear at the beginning of the press conference.

01:01:41 This is the one we'll hear at the end of the press conference.

01:01:43 I don't know. I've

01:01:45 been confused about that. So it's been confusing.

01:01:49 It has been confusing. Part of that is that this is a confusing

01:01:52 time. You know, people that I talked to

01:01:56 privately, expectations, John, are all over the place, that people who think

01:02:00 that won't stop, they won't cut away some go to some and that we get 75 basis

01:02:04 points that people will think they'll start in March and that they are

01:02:09 frontloaded because of the elections that people who think like me, they're

01:02:13 likely to wait until near a much nearer to the summer and then start with 25

01:02:18 basis points. Expectations are all over.

01:02:21 And what's really interesting is that forward guidance have lost has lost its

01:02:25 power. The Fed has been very clear in terms of

01:02:28 its forward guidance and the market is saying, yeah, sure, but I'm not going to

01:02:32 listen to you. That's really problematic.

01:02:34 You said you're not in the business of predicting the future.

01:02:36 Can I just jump in and get you to predict the future?

01:02:39 When's that first rate cut come in, Mohammed?

01:02:41 My my own gut feeling is that it will come in the beginning of the summer.

01:02:49 So call it June, maybe July, and it will be 25 basis points.

01:02:54 And not only do I think that that's what's going to happen, I think that

01:02:58 that's what should happen. Okay, Mohammed, appreciate your time

01:03:02 today, this morning. Thank you, sir, as always.

01:03:04 Mohammed Al Arian of Bloomberg Opinion and Queens College, Cambridge.

01:03:08 Lisa, what do you make of that? Just the idea that this is what they

01:03:10 should and this is what they will do, which is to push back.

01:03:12 And it frankly, it means a lot of repricing in the markets.

01:03:14 That's all I can say, because right now you have a significant lean, about a

01:03:18 half percent to a 50% chance of a rate cut come March, not in the business of

01:03:22 predicting the future, but we got him to predict the future just a little bit

01:03:25 towards the end of the conversation. Equities right now in the S&P 500

01:03:28 negative here by 0.1%. Let's give you an update on stories

01:03:32 elsewhere this morning in case you're pulling back, brace with the hiring

01:03:34 hacker. Sayonara.

01:03:35 Hi, John. The Biden administration has frozen

01:03:38 approvals for new licenses to export LNG.

01:03:41 Officials say they need time to scrutinize how shipments affect the

01:03:45 climate, the economy and national security.

01:03:47 The halt will likely disrupt plans for billions of dollars in projects.

01:03:52 President Biden saying, quote, This pause on new LNG approvals sees the

01:03:56 climate crisis for what it is the existential threats of our time.

01:04:01 Some major US chains are dealing with a growing number of Middle East consumers

01:04:06 boycotting Western brands over America's lack of action to try and end the

01:04:10 Israel-Hamas war. McDonald's and Starbucks are among the

01:04:14 companies affected, while one local Egyptian soda brand said its sales have

01:04:19 tripled since the war began As consumers boycott Coca-Cola and Pepsi, shares of

01:04:25 LVMH are surging after the luxury retailer saw sales rise at the end of

01:04:30 last year. An increase in sales of handbags

01:04:33 produced 10% growth in revenue over the final quarter, with the company's

01:04:37 billionaire CEO saying he was, quote, very confident for the year ahead.

01:04:42 That's your Bloomberg brief John. Hi, Rick.

01:04:44 Thank you. Coming up next on the program,

01:04:46 volatility on the horizon, a higher volatility backdrop both in terms of the

01:04:51 macro conditions, including inflation and the market, I think should be part

01:04:56 of the assumption as we continue in this year.

01:04:59 That's coming up next on the program live from New York City.

01:05:01 You're watching Bloomberg Surveillance.

01:05:15 Six day winning streak on the S&P 500. We might just snap that we might.

01:05:20 On the S&P, we look like this with -0.05% Bitcoin.

01:05:24 Absolutely nowhere in the equity market and in the bond markets.

01:05:27 They want a ten year full. 1124 under surveillance this morning.

01:05:31 Volatility on the horizon. You got volatility so low that to some

01:05:37 degree it's just a simple reversion to the mean.

01:05:39 You can only go so much lower before you see it turn back up and volatility.

01:05:43 So a higher volatility backdrop both in terms of the macro conditions including

01:05:47 inflation and the market I think should be part of the assumption as we continue

01:05:53 in this year between mixed messages from the Federal Reserve on interest rates,

01:05:56 geopolitical instability and the presidential election less than a year

01:06:00 away, investors are bracing for the unpredictable scenario of Alpine and

01:06:04 woods right in this. The growth in earnings and drop in rate

01:06:07 scenarios needs to find a common narrative.

01:06:09 At the moment, it seems difficult to square the circle of a market looking

01:06:12 for both 10% plus earnings growth and deep cuts in interest rates.

01:06:16 Sara Hunt joins us around a table. Morning, Sarah.

01:06:19 Good morning. So it's your job to square the circle

01:06:20 place? I don't think we can and I think this is

01:06:23 the biggest issue right now is that you've had this big move up in

01:06:26 multiples. You've got this expectation that the Fed

01:06:28 is going to rate cuts at least from cut rates, at least from the market's

01:06:31 perspective, more than the Fed is telling you.

01:06:33 You've got this growth in earnings while you're seeing fourth quarter earnings

01:06:36 coming in, fine. But the expectations going forward so

01:06:39 far have been a mixed bag. And for many people, people are just

01:06:42 pulling guidance. So how do I square that and say, okay,

01:06:45 that should all be fine and risk assets should just be able to keep performing

01:06:49 well in this environment? And I think Cameron made a really good

01:06:51 point earlier on margins, which is one of those things that we've been looking

01:06:54 at and saying all these things that we're doing are not positive for

01:06:57 margins. How does that help?

01:06:59 So which part of the rally are you leaning against the most, which has

01:07:02 gotten ahead of itself? Well, you know, the parts that have

01:07:05 gotten ahead of itself are still the parts that you can't ignore, like the

01:07:07 tech sector, Right. Because some of those earnings really

01:07:09 are growing that quickly. So in some cases, something like NVIDIA,

01:07:12 Yes, it looks like it's had a huge move and it's grown enormously.

01:07:15 But you look at the cash flow that they're supposed to generate, you go,

01:07:17 okay, actually, relatively speaking, it's not as crazy as it looks in some

01:07:20 other areas. I just think the entire idea that you

01:07:24 can just keep pushing risk assets higher while you're looking for all of these

01:07:28 minutia that's going on and the rest of the world not doing that well, it just

01:07:32 seems a little difficult, but it's hard to pinpoint exactly where the problem

01:07:35 is. Otherwise, you could just say, well, I'm

01:07:36 going to short this or I'm going to short that.

01:07:38 And that's it's tough. Now for the psychology portion of the

01:07:41 program. I'm curious how much this is just really

01:07:43 a reversal of what we saw last year, that people were so pessimistic and they

01:07:47 got it so wrong that now they feel like all of their sort of little voices in

01:07:51 the back of their head saying, oh, this looks a little concerning.

01:07:54 They got to kind of ignore that because it has been a nirvana economic outlook,

01:07:59 at least so far this year. And it's not usually where the narrative

01:08:02 changes when everybody decides that it's okay.

01:08:04 And it's really different this time. And that's all right.

01:08:06 I mean, we fight with that ourselves all the time, which is, you know, are we

01:08:09 really in this situation where you've got different drivers of market

01:08:12 performance, you've got different buyers of equities, you've got hedge funds,

01:08:15 you've got microfinance, does that really change you underneath if and when

01:08:18 you finally start to say, yes, the fundamental picture is change?

01:08:21 Well, the world tends to be, you know, gods with copybook headings come back

01:08:24 and say, well, maybe not exactly. So I don't the answer is I'm not really

01:08:28 sure. And I think that you've got some time in

01:08:30 the near term, but you've got all this stuff coming up in March.

01:08:32 Does the Fed really cut? What do they telegraph?

01:08:34 What happens with the PTF Putin expiring?

01:08:37 There's a whole lot of things in the underneath that also make it figuring.

01:08:40 I think that you're going to see Liz and Saunders points and more volatility so

01:08:43 center what you like right now. Like I said, we like some of those big

01:08:48 tech names that people are that that have moved a lot.

01:08:50 I mean, the video has been a big move, but there are some areas that we think

01:08:53 that are really you've got some good cash generation.

01:08:56 Some of the other semiconductors are quite expensive relative to video right

01:08:59 now. And I think that even though we like

01:09:01 them going forward because we just think that you're going to continue to

01:09:04 increase technology, some of those areas are are tough.

01:09:08 And, you know, there's places in the environment that we like, we like

01:09:10 trained. You know, we like the carrier.

01:09:12 We like some of the areas where you've got this giant HVAC replacement cycle

01:09:17 that's going to be environmental stuff. At least when I were talking about the

01:09:20 conflict in the data and also the conflict in the annex, I think it's

01:09:23 really important. Just look at visa yesterday, consumer

01:09:25 spending resilient. Then you go to Capital One and they're

01:09:28 talking about borrowers falling behind on their credit cards and auto loans.

01:09:31 And I'm trying to work out if I was an investor right now, do I want to own

01:09:34 consumer discretionary in America? Is that a story I want to bank?

01:09:38 Well, this is exactly goes to the point of LVMH just having great numbers.

01:09:41 And people like Capital One who have on the credit side are starting to see some

01:09:45 issues. Discovery started to see some issues on

01:09:46 the credit side. I don't know.

01:09:47 Inside, you've got a huge bifurcation in the consumer and you've got a high end

01:09:51 consumer that's doing fairly well and you've got a low in consumer that to the

01:09:54 whole point of this economic backdrop, price levels are still very high.

01:09:58 You know, Yes. All those things that Mohamed El-Erian

01:10:00 was just talking about in the economy that are good, are good.

01:10:02 But it doesn't matter if I'm struggling to put groceries in my cart and I and

01:10:06 everything is so much more expensive than it was just to build on that kind

01:10:10 of narrative. We also got American Express just

01:10:13 moments ago and they said that, yes, write offs not so great, but they expect

01:10:17 much better earnings because of robust sign up to some of the premium card.

01:10:21 So again, it's catering to that richer kind of class.

01:10:23 I want to go back to this idea of margins then and sort of the margin

01:10:26 compression and pricing power. At what point is disinflation, which is

01:10:31 good for the economy and particularly for lower income families, At what point

01:10:35 is that very negative for a certain slew of stocks in terms of their margins that

01:10:40 you're watching? There's always that issue when you've

01:10:43 got price level changes for somebody, it's good for somebody, it's bad for

01:10:46 somebody else, right? You drop oil prices down, all of a

01:10:49 sudden, refiners have a good couple of quarters.

01:10:51 There's always the input, depends on who the input people are and who the output

01:10:54 people are in which prices are actually falling.

01:10:56 So it's going to be it's going to be an issue.

01:10:58 But I think that margins in general, you've got a lot of cost structures that

01:11:02 are going higher, wages are going higher.

01:11:03 They might not be going as high as inflation, but they're going higher if

01:11:07 you can't get continued price increases, which I would argue the automakers are

01:11:11 having trouble doing. I mean, look at what Tesla just did.

01:11:13 Look at some of the areas that are big, some of the tech stocks.

01:11:15 It's not so much of an issue because of your input into some things.

01:11:19 Ultimate manufacturer is a small part of that price.

01:11:21 It's much less of an issue than if it's a big part of that price because

01:11:24 everyone's trying to cut costs. What about some of the winners, the

01:11:27 airlines, the cruise liners, some of those kinds of areas where it is

01:11:31 discretionary spending and there's a real big mix of potential clients?

01:11:34 Well, on the airline side, it's tough because you've got capacity changes all

01:11:38 over the globe that are sometimes hard to track and sometimes conflict with

01:11:41 where people think that they should be. All right.

01:11:42 So the US domestic is not been as good as international because there's been

01:11:46 additions in capacity on the airline side, there's plenty of places where

01:11:49 people are spending money. The question is, is there enough

01:11:53 capacity restriction to make that price able for people able to raise prices,

01:11:58 which I'm losing my words, but you know what I mean?

01:12:00 Don't worry. It's early in the morning.

01:12:01 Let's finish on the autos, if we can. We've done a round trip.

01:12:04 It's like stock market roulette at the moment.

01:12:05 So let's finish on the autos. Tester was down 12% yesterday.

01:12:09 This feels like a really difficult moment.

01:12:11 And I want to just say just for Tester, I mean, the whole industry in America

01:12:14 right now going to the low cost producers out of China at a time when

01:12:18 labor costs, particularly for Ford, Stellantis and GM, are moving in the

01:12:22 wrong direction for them. How investible is that sector at the

01:12:24 moment from your perspective? I think it's very difficult because I

01:12:28 think you're looking at an area where you've got you haven't had as much

01:12:31 consumer demand because interest rates have gone up.

01:12:33 So now cars are even less affordable, insurance is going higher.

01:12:36 There was a there was a story on insurance because cars are more

01:12:39 expensive to fix and there's a lot more technology in them.

01:12:42 All of these things are driving it to be a much more expensive proposition than

01:12:45 it used to be. I think for Tesla, you've got this

01:12:48 interim period where they're now promising a more low cost vehicle to

01:12:52 compete with other things, but also because I think you had a huge range of

01:12:55 first adopters in EVs and now EV, you seem a little bit stuck and all the

01:12:58 automakers went all in on EVs because they were told you basically by the

01:13:02 government and everything else. I think you've got a lot of

01:13:04 cross-currents. It makes it very difficult to parse what

01:13:06 the underlying real financial fundamentals are from January 26th, and

01:13:09 I think we're down about 26% year to date for Tesla.

01:13:12 It's been a brutal start to the year, and that press conference didn't really

01:13:16 help, especially with Dan Ives saying that basically it was a train wreck and

01:13:19 then a plane crash. And then he just said, you know, it's an

01:13:21 understatement. So it is still bullish.

01:13:23 Well, for now, yeah. Wedbush just removed Tesla from their

01:13:26 best ideas list. Interesting.

01:13:28 So that's a very subtle shift. Interesting going on under the cover.

01:13:32 Hi, Sarah. It's good to see you as always.

01:13:34 Thanks for being with us in the new studio, Sarah Hunter, a vampire and sex

01:13:36 and words coming up next on the program. Looking ahead to the Fed meeting.

01:13:40 Bob, Michael, Jp morgan Asset Management for the next 30 minutes.

01:13:43 I'm Bloomberg Surveillance.

01:13:57 Brace yourself. But Michael, Jp morgan, showing up with

01:14:01 attitudes, real attitude and a commercial break could be with us in

01:14:05 just a second. Equity futures on the S&P 500 look a

01:14:08 little something like this. We're negative here by 0.07% on the S&P

01:14:12 506 day winning streak, the longest since mid-December, extending the

01:14:16 longest winning streak, daily winning streak of the year so far on the Nasdaq,

01:14:20 down about a third of 1%. The rest, Russell, the small caps up by

01:14:22 0.4. In the bond market, two year, ten year,

01:14:25 30 year. Much more on treasuries a little bit

01:14:27 later in this segment. We're unchanged on a ten year, 4/12 on a

01:14:31 two year high, a by a basis point of two for 1397.

01:14:35 And just to finish on foreign exchange and in the way basically where we

01:14:37 started the week and ended last week around 1291287c on the euro positive by

01:14:42 0.2% disadvantage. This morning, Treasury Secretary Janet

01:14:46 Yellen touting the US economy, telling the Economic Club of Chicago that

01:14:50 inflation is, quote, well under control and that most Americans would agree.

01:14:55 People are getting ahead. They're seeing their fortunes improve.

01:15:00 And I believe if inflation stays low, they'll begin to regain their confidence

01:15:06 in the economy. Another rate on the US economy coming in

01:15:09 just under an hour with personal spending and the PC call deflator due at

01:15:13 830 Eastern time with most Americans agree with that statement?

01:15:17 Not if you look at the polls right now, which are all red when it comes to

01:15:20 Biden's approval on the economy, on inflation.

01:15:22 Look at this Economist YouGov poll. This was done January 21st to 23rd, -21

01:15:28 spread on inflation specifically. So it's not catching up to Americans

01:15:33 just yet, but maybe it will. And I think she was leaning into that.

01:15:36 I also thought her comments on tax cuts were really interesting along them,

01:15:40 especially given some of the focus on reducing the deficit and how to

01:15:44 distinguish from the former President Trump, but only with a nuance.

01:15:48 If you make $400,000 or less, which we've heard Biden say this a lot.

01:15:52 But if you're a little bit above that bracket and Biden's re-elected, it's

01:15:56 very difficult to get those Trump air tax cuts through.

01:15:58 Speaking of Donald Trump going after Nikki Haley and Nikki Haley's campaign

01:16:02 donors saying anyone that makes a contribution to his GOP rival will be,

01:16:05 quote, permanently barred from the McCain camp.

01:16:08 I'm not sure how many people believe this losses in Iowa and New Hampshire,

01:16:11 leaving Haley with little chance of winning the GOP nomination.

01:16:14 But that's not stopping the former president going after her donors who

01:16:17 contributed around $50 million to her campaign in the second half of last

01:16:20 year, slightly more than what Trump received.

01:16:24 And Murray, we heard from earlier of HCF investments.

01:16:27 And I said, will he actually follow through with this?

01:16:29 And he just said flat out, no. Not a chance.

01:16:31 What politician is going to follow through when Dana calls you and says, I

01:16:35 can help fund your campaign? And campaigns in America are very, very

01:16:39 expensive. That was so interesting about the

01:16:41 campaign financing of both these super PACs is Haley brought in more $5 million

01:16:45 more than Trump did, but potentially that's going to start to evaporate.

01:16:48 The other unusual dimension of this, of course, if you look at the lessons of

01:16:51 New Hampshire, the inability of the former president to attract moderates,

01:16:54 there are some people who believe the perfect running mate would be Nikki

01:16:58 Haley. How much you want to poison the water

01:17:00 over the next few weeks? It seems like Greg Valliere, just to

01:17:03 lean on his comments, didn't seem to think that that was a likelihood.

01:17:06 No. And honestly, after some of the

01:17:07 commentary back and forth, it doesn't seem likely.

01:17:10 That said, the problem with independents really raises some questions for the

01:17:13 Trump campaign. Well, if Trump wants to win, he might

01:17:15 have to look outside a potential MAGA running mate and get someone that's more

01:17:19 in the middle so they can actually encompass the entire party.

01:17:22 If he has Nikki Haley. She can go out and talk to women living

01:17:25 in suburbs. That would help him a lot.

01:17:27 That's the politics. Let's pick out a single name.

01:17:29 We've been talking about LVMH, we've talked about in some as well.

01:17:32 LVMH is running it hard. Intel is not.

01:17:35 It's down about 11%. Shares of Intel tumbling after the chip

01:17:39 maker delivered a disappointing forecast, renewing doubts about a

01:17:41 comeback for the once dominant company. Intel expecting first quarter sales to

01:17:45 come in around a billion shy of estimates.

01:17:47 The CEO Pat Gelsinger, saying the company has a lot of work to do.

01:17:51 Gasket joints Bloomberg Technology about 1 p.m.

01:17:54 Eastern time. What are your thoughts on that?

01:17:56 RAMO Intel's in a tough, tough spot, isn't it?

01:17:59 Yeah. Given the fact that profit they're

01:18:01 expecting in the first quarter, $0.13 a share versus the expectation of $0.34 a

01:18:05 share. You know, we were talking about this

01:18:07 with Ed, and it is a mix of what your products are.

01:18:11 But to Mohamed El-Erian point, the dispersion of the haves, the have nots,

01:18:14 it's not just to go into tech, it's to go into the technology that is most

01:18:18 leveraged to the current, you know, sort of feel in the business world those

01:18:22 dispersions are getting greater and greater, which makes it more challenging

01:18:26 to really have an overall call that percolates down to the smaller companies

01:18:30 or big, bigger companies. Well, for out, they're just not in the

01:18:33 right space in the right spot right now and they're not getting traction.

01:18:36 And how much can you really get a competitive edge when there is already

01:18:39 that critical mass in some of the other chip makers and some of the other tech

01:18:43 companies? Intel is plunging.

01:18:44 The broader stock market recovering. Equity futures right now just about

01:18:47 unchanged, kind of get down to a Fed decision next week.

01:18:50 The data continuing to show a resilient the US economy.

01:18:53 But Michael Global, head of fixed income at J.P.

01:18:55 Morgan Asset Management. Right in this whatever the mirror image

01:18:58 of stagflation is, that is exactly what we wound up with.

01:19:01 Let's call it economic nirvana. Given the momentum, it's difficult to

01:19:04 imagine anything other than trend growth ahead.

01:19:08 But Michael joins us now. Morning, Bob.

01:19:09 Good morning. Good to catch up with you, sir.

01:19:11 We're not going to talk about Liverpool yet.

01:19:12 I'm going to save that for the end of the segment.

01:19:13 Okay. So just wait for that.

01:19:16 Let's talk about bonds and the Federal Reserve first and this economic

01:19:19 backdrop. This is a big change for you.

01:19:21 I remember being with you 12 months, anticipating that 12 months ago,

01:19:24 anticipating that hard landing. Not any more.

01:19:26 Why do you think this can continue? Well, 12 months ago, there was every

01:19:30 reason to expect recession. There are rate shocks del
