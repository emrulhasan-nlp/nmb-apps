00:13 >> RIGHT NOW IT IS A FED PIVOT PARTY AND WE ARE ALL INVITED.

00:18 >> WE ARE SEEING INFLATION SLOWING, AND IT'S CONSISTENT

00:19 WITH WHAT THE FED EXPECTS.

00:24 >> WE HAVE HIT PEAK RATES AND PEAK FED. INFLATION IS SLOWING.

00:28 >> I DON'T THINK WE ARE GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO WHERE WE

00:30 WERE IN 2019.

00:36 >> AS WE MOVE THE COUNTED PAGE INTO 2024 WE SEE A LITTLE BIT

00:39 OF AN UPTICK, THAT COULD FORCE THE FED'S HAND TO TAKE ONE

00:44 FINAL RATE INCREASE.

00:48 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE WITH TOM, JONATHAN

00:52 FERRO, AND LISA ABRAMOWICZ. JONATHAN:

00:57 THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE ON BLOOMBERG TV AND RADIO.

00:59 I AM JONATHAN FERRO. YOUR OPENING MARKET ON THE S&P

01:04 IS POSITIVE 5.1%. A THREE-PART STORY THIS

01:08 AFTERNOON. STATEMENT, PROJECTIONS, NEWS

01:12 CONFERENCE WITH CHAIRMAN POWELL. WILL HE RSVP TO THE FED PIVOT

01:14 PARTY? TOM: IN THE LAST 24 HOURS PEOPLE

01:21 WERE WRITING NOTES, YOU KNOW THEY PUT STATEMENT UP.

01:22 THEN THEY PUT UP THE GUESSTIMATE STATEMENT.

01:25 THIS IS WHAT THEY ACTUALLY SAID. I AM MORE FOCUSED ON THE

01:30 DISPERSION OF THE DOTS. I'M USUALLY WOULDN'T SAY THAT.

01:36 THIS TIME AROUND, I THINK THAT EVERYONE HAS TO RECALIBRATE.

01:42 JONATHAN: THAT IS REFRESHING. THANK YOU, T.K.. TOM:

01:48 I WAS SHOCKED. JONATHAN:

01:54 THE 2024 DOT. LISA: HE'S WRONG. TOM: TOM IS WRONG?

02:02 JONATHAN: THE 2024., HOW MANY CUTS WILL

02:06 BE IMPLIED BY THE 2024. RAISED ON WHERE WE ARE IN THE

02:07 MARKET? HOW MUCH DAYLIGHT WILL THERE BE

02:10 AT THE END OF THE DAY BETWEEN THE MARKET AND THE FEDERAL

02:16 RESERVE? LISA: IF THEY SAY, AS MANY EXPECT,

02:20 THAT THEY WILL CUT RATES BY 50 BASIS POINTS, THERE WILL BE

02:24 ENOUGH FOR THE FULL YEAR. VERY DIFFERENT THAN 100 BASIS

02:27 POINTS THAT THE MARKET IS PRICING IN.

02:30 THUS THE MARKET DISCOUNT THE FED'S PROJECTIONS SAYING WE

02:31 WILL GO WITH OUR ESTIMATE. TOM: WE HAVE A BULL COMING UP.

02:36 JON FERRO, I'M LOOKING AT THE BLOOMBERG FINANCIAL CONDITIONS

02:41 INDEX. CHAIRMAN POWELL GOES INTO THIS

02:44 WITH A SCREAMING ACCOMMODATIVE STATISTIC. JONATHAN:

02:48 YOU SAY WE HAVE A POLE AND WE ARE LOOKING FOR PEOPLE LOOKING

02:51 FOR A 10% UPSIDE IN 2024. THE S&P 500 IS UP 10%, NEVER

02:57 MIND BULLISH FOR NEXT YEAR. THE LAST MONTH HAS BEEN

02:59 ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. TOM:

03:00 I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE 4.22 OR 4.25.

03:06 IT DOESN'T WANT TO GO HIGHER YIELDS. JONATHAN:

03:12 CHAIRMAN POWELL PUSHING BACK LATER? LISA:

03:16 IF HE DOESN'T COME HOW MUCH DOES THAT SIGNAL, LET'S GO,

03:19 BULL MARKET, GAME ON, GO FURTHER?

03:23 THE EXPECTATION FOR TODAY'S MEETING IS THAT HE WILL PUSH

03:24 BACK. IF HE DOESN'T COME HOW MUCH

03:28 WILL THAT SURPRISE THE MARKET TO SAY, YOU WANT TO BE THE MOST

03:32 ACCOMMODATIVE SINCE WE STARTED RAISING RATES?

03:34 THAT IS PROBABLY OK. TOM: SOMEONE WILL ASK A RUDE

03:38 QUESTION. THIS GO WITH GINA OF THE NEW

03:41 YORK TIMES. SHE WILL PROBABLY GET TAYLOR

03:43 SWIFT INTO IT. HE WILL GO TO A PREPARED

03:45 STATEMENT. MADAME LAGARDE IS THE SAME WAY.

03:52 BAILEY, THE BANK OF ENGLAND? PROBABLY NOT.

03:56 THEY WILL READ FROM A PREPARED STATEMENT.

03:58 THE THREE OF US COULD WRITE THAT STATEMENT RIGHT NOW.

04:01 JONATHAN: HE HAS SPOKEN RECENTLY.

04:06 JUST REPEAT WHAT HE SAID RECENTLY, TOO PREMATURE TO

04:11 ENGAGE IN A CONVERSATION ABOUT INTEREST-RATE CHANGES.

04:13 GOVERNOR WALLER HAS ALREADY GONE THERE.

04:14 THAT IS THE QUESTION THAT PEOPLE WILL ASK IN THE NEWS

04:16 CONFERENCE. WE KNOW THAT. IF I WAS MIKE MCKEE I WOULD

04:20 CALL GOVERNOR WALLER AND SAY, THOUGHTS? LISA:

04:25 EVEN IF HE REPEATS WHAT HE SAID, THAT WILL BE VIEWED AS

04:26 REALLY DOVISH. THE ONLY THING THAT HE COULD

04:33 SAY NOW IS SAY CATEGORICALLY WE DON'T THINK THAT IT'S

04:35 APPROPRIATE FOR PEOPLE TO BE CELEBRATING VICTORY AT THIS

04:36 POINT. WE HAVE NOT REACHED IT, WE ARE

04:41 NOT ON BOARD WITH IT. IF HE PUSHES BACK ON SOME LEVEL

04:45 AND SAYS, YOU CAN THEORETICALLY TALK ABOUT ALL THE CUTS YOU

04:47 WANT BUT WE ARE NOT THERE AND THE MARKET IS GETTING AHEAD OF

04:51 ITSELF, THAT WILL BE A SIGNAL. ANYTHING BARRING THAT IS A

04:53 FIRING GUN FOR THE NEXT RALLY. TOM:

05:00 THE STATISTIC YESTERDAY WAS FLAT-ISH, NOT DISINFLATION-Y.

05:04 HE CAN LEAN ON THAT. LISA: IF CHAIRMAN POWELL PUSHES BACK,

05:11 HOW CREDIBLE WILL IT BE WITH THIS MARKET, WHICH IS ON

05:15 ANOTHER PLANET LOOKING FORWARD TO 2024?

05:16 IN THE EQUITY MARKET, WE ARE POSITIVE.

05:24 THE YIELD SLOWER BY SINGLE BASIS POINT. 4.1852.

05:29 THE EURO, A TOUCH WEAKER, 1.0774. LISA: 8:30 AM, U.S.

05:38 NOVEMBER PPI, THIS WILL BE KEY TO UNDERSTANDING MARGINS.

05:41 WE BASICALLY SAW A DISINFLATIONARY TREND.

05:43 DOES IT HOLD?

05:52 SURVEILLANCE, THE FED DECIDES, WE ARE BACK ON AIR, YOU WILL BE

05:53 THERE.

06:00 BILL DUDLEY, THE FORMER NEW YORK FED PRESIDENT AND A HOST

06:03 OF OTHERS TO GIVE THE DRUMBEAT TO THIS RATE DECISION AND

06:07 COMMENTARY AFTER. 2:00 P.M. IS THE RATE DECISION.

06:12 I AM LESS INTERESTED IN THAT. I AM MORE INTERESTED IN THE

06:15 STATEMENT OF ACADEMIC PROJECTIONS.

06:20 THEN THE NEWS CONFERENCE BY JAY POWELL.

06:22 HOW MUCH DOES HE PUSH BACK? IT MATTERS IF PEOPLE BELIEVE

06:27 HIM, BUT EVEN MORE, IF HE DOESN'T FIND IT NECESSARY TO

06:29 EXPLICITLY PUSH BACK HOW MUCH WILL THAT BE TAKEN AS

06:31 CONFIRMATION OF THE MOVES WE'VE SEEN IN THE MARKET ALREADY?

06:34 JONATHAN: THE LAST WORKING DAY OF THE

06:35 YEAR? IS THAT OFFICIAL? NO? TOMORROW MORNING?

06:41 LISA:

06:41 THE BANK OF ENGLAND, WE HAVE -- JONATHAN:

06:47 WE ARE DOING SECOND-TIER CENTRAL BANKS TOMORROW?

06:53 LISA: I AM EMBARRASSED. THEY ARE NOT. THEY MATTER.

06:58 JONATHAN: RISING 13% NEXT YEAR TO 5200.

07:04 WE LOOK FOR 2024 TO BE THE YEAR OF TRANSITION AS MARKETS

07:07 NAVIGATE WHAT WE EXPECT WILL BE THE FEDS PIVOT FROM A

07:09 RESTRICTIVE MONETARY POLICY SETTING TO AN EASIER START.

07:15 JOHN, I THINK THAT YOUR CALL IS ORIGINAL IN THE SENSE THAT I

07:18 DON'T THINK THAT IT IS TOO DEPENDENT ON RATE CUTS NEXT

07:22 YEAR IN THE SAME WAY THAT IT ILLS -- THAT IT IS ELSEWHERE.

07:24 CAN YOU GO THROUGH YOUR FRAMEWORK? JOHN:

07:30 IT IS GREAT TO BE ON "SURVEILLANCE" AS ALWAYS, JON.

07:35 WHEN WE LOOK AT IT, WE THINK THAT THE TRADERS RIGHT NOW ARE

07:41 PUSHING THIS DREAM OF FOR RATE CUTS NEXT YEAR.

07:44 WE THINK THAT THE ECONOMY IS SHOWING SIGNIFICANT RESILIENCE

07:47 IN THE FACE OF WHAT IS 11 HIKES AND THREE PAUSES THUS FAR, OR

07:50 SKIPS AS THE FED PREFERS TO CALL IT.

07:55 THE FED HAS SHOWED REMARKABLE

08:02 SENSITIVITY AS IT WORKS TO KEEP INFLATION IN CHECK.

08:05 ALL IN ALL, WE THINK THAT THIS LOOKS GOOD WITH CUTS LIKELY TO

08:08 HAPPEN IN THE SECOND HALF OF

08:14 THE YEAR AND PROBABLY MAINTAIN MOSTLY, IF IT'S GOING TO

08:18 HAPPEN, MOSTLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER.

08:21 AND THEN ONLY ONCE OR TWICE. TOM: THERE IS A SHIFT GOING ON.

08:30 THE GREAT CHART GUY AT FIDELITY, THERE IS A SHIFT TO

08:34 EARNINGS ANALYSIS. WE ARE MOVING AWAY FROM FED

08:39 NAVELGAZING TO OMG LOOK AT REVENUES AND EARNINGS.

08:41 WE HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE. HOW DOES THE MARKET REACT? JOHN:

08:46 WE THINK THAT THE MARKET IS ACTUALLY WELL-POSITIONED TO

08:48 REACT POSITIVELY TO IT. IT IS NOT ONLY ABOUT TRADERS,

08:55 IT IS INTERMEDIATE LONGER-TERM INVESTORS AND TRADERS WHO

08:56 CREATE THE ENVIRONMENT. THE MARKETS ARE LIKE MUSIC.

09:00 IT IS MATH AND EMOTION. IT IS FEAR, GREED, AND NEED.

09:08 SOME INVEST FOR NEED, OTHER INVEST FOR THE SHORT TERM, THE

09:09 FEAR AND GREED ASPECT. IT CREATES -- I DON'T WANT TO

09:15 CALL IT A COCKTAIL BECAUSE THAT SOUNDS TOO VOLATILE, BUT IT

09:21 CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY WHERE IF WE FOCUS ON EARNINGS IN AN

09:23 ENVIRONMENT WHERE IT IS THE END OF FREE MONEY WHERE BOND

09:24 ISSUERS HAVE TO PAY FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF BORROWING MONEY

09:27 AND BONFIRES GET SOMETHING IN RETURN, THIS LOOKS LIKE A MORE

09:32 NORMALIZED ENVIRONMENT AND WE LIKE IT. LISA:

09:35 DOES MAKE YOU NERVOUS THAT EVERYONE SEEMS TO BE AGREEING

09:36 WITH YOU THESE DAYS? JOHN: IT DOES.

09:41 WE SAW A LOT OF THE BEARS TELLING US ABOUT THE PENDING

09:47 RECESSION AND MASSIVE UNEMPLOYMENT COMING AND ALL OF

09:49 THIS STUFF THAT WAS NEGATIVE. THEY TOOK THE NEGATIVE PITCH

09:57 BOOK SOLD LAST YEAR AND WE BELIEVE THAT IS WHAT CAUSED THE

09:58 MARKET TO DECLINE AS IT DID LAST YEAR ON THINGS THAT WERE

10:00 NEVER REALIZED. THE BEARS HAVE PIVOTED.

10:06 WHEN THEY PIVOT YOU GET THE FEELING IF YOU ARE ON A BOAT

10:08 ALL OF A SUDDEN EVERYONE IS ON YOUR SIDE OF THE BOAT AND YOU

10:14 START LOOKING FOR LITTLE BALANCE.

10:16 THAT MIGHT BE IN TERMS OF TAKING ADVANTAGE OF SOME OF THE

10:18 DIVERSIFICATION FIXED INCOME OFFERS AS WELL AS OTHER AREAS

10:22 OF THE MARKET, THE EQUITY MARKET, THAT HAVE YET TO

10:24 PARTICIPATE IN THE RALLY. LISA: ARE YOU BROADENING OUT TO SMALL

10:32 CAPS AND LESS LOVED AREAS AWAY FROM FOCUSING ON BIG TECH? JOHN:

10:37 LISA, WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH BETTER QUALITY SMALL CAPS ON AN

10:41 ALPHA BASIS. ON TERMS OF A BETA BASIS, WE

10:48 ARE USING PASSIVE INDEXES, USING THE S&P 600 ATF VERSUS

10:51 THE RUSSELL 2000 FOR THAT PURPOSE FOR QUITE A WHILE.

10:56 IT HAS HURT US IN TERMS OF OVERALL PERFORMANCE, BUT IT HAS

10:57 GIVEN US STABILITY. WE CAN'T HELP BUT NOTICE ON

11:01 DAYS WHEN THERE'S VOLATILITY IN THE MARKET, IT IS CAUSED BY

11:05 NERVOUS MONEY PULLING OUT OF THE LARGE CAPS.

11:08 USUALLY THESE DAYS THEY ARE GOING INTO THE S&P 400 MID-CAPS

11:15 OR S&P 600, OR WHEN THE TIDE COMES IN AND ALL SHIPS ARE

11:19 FLOATING THEY ROAR INTO THE RUSSELL 2000. TOM:

11:22 WHAT IS A COMFORTABLE PRICE TO EARNINGS RATIO? WE ARE 21 SPX.

11:27 OBVIOUSLY, THERE HAS BEEN MULTIPLE EXPANSION.

11:29 WHAT IS A HISTORICALLY COMFORTABLE PE FOR VIEWERS AND

11:33 LISTENERS? JOHN: WHEN IT COMES TO HISTORICAL,

11:37 YOU HAVE TO THINK GENERATIONS.

11:43 I CAN'T HELP BUT LEAN ON THE COOPERMAN'S RATIOS.

11:48 PROBABLY 12 TIMES. FOR MOST BOOMERS IT IS AROUND

11:49 16. AS YOU GET YOUNGER, THE GENERATIONS KEEP PUSHING THAT

11:53 MULTIPLE UP. SOME OF THAT IS PROBABLY

11:59 BECAUSE -- SOME OF THEM, IT IS A MORE AGGRESSIVE POSITIONING,

12:03 BUT IT ALSO HAS TO DO WITH THE NEED THAT PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING

12:04 TO REALIZE. SOCIAL SECURITY WILL NOT BE AT

12:11 THE SAME STEAD THAT IT WAS FOR MANY DECADES FOR GENERATIONS TO

12:12 COME. PEOPLE NEED TO INVEST. IT IS

12:16 LIKE REAL ESTATE IN NEW YORK.

12:23 IN 1978 YOU COULD BUY A CO-OP REALLY CHEAP.EVEN TODAY WITH

12:25 ALL OF THE PROBLEMS THAT THE CITY HAS, IF YOU LOOK AT THE

12:30 PRICES ON CO-OPS THE ASK IS -- YOU PALE LOOKING AT IT GIVEN A

12:34 HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE.

12:41 PROBABLY 21 TO 22. I AM NOT A GUNSLINGER.

12:43 IT IS JUST THAT THE DEMAND FOR EQUITIES, WHEN PRIVATE EQUITIES

12:45 HAS TAKEN SUMMARY STOCKS OUT OF THE MARKET IT CREATES DEMAND

12:48 THAT IS CHASING SUPPLY. JONATHAN:

12:53 CO-OP FEES ANOTHER DAY. LOVE THAT.

12:56 OPPENHEIMER ASSET MANAGEMENT HAVE A WONDERFUL CHRISTMAS.

13:01 HE HAS HAD A WONDERFUL YEAR. THE LAST TWO YEARS HAVE BEEN

13:03 BRUISING. 22 WRONG, YOU BETTER GET 23

13:08 RIGHT. THE EQUITY MARKET IS BACK WHERE

13:09 IT STARTED. TOM:

13:15 THE SMART PEOPLE IS NOT SO MUCH THAT THEY WERE RIGHT OR GOT A

13:17 STATISTIC RIGHT.

13:23 JOHN AT DEUTSCHE BANK WOULD BE AN EXAMPLE.

13:24 THEY DIDN'T GO TO CASH. MARKET TIMING.

13:28 THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF ACADEMIC WORK ON THIS.

13:32 UMASS LEADING THE WAY 20 YEARS AGO. THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF

13:33 ACADEMIC WORK. --, I'M IN. CACHE, I'M SHORT.

13:38 IT IS A TOUGH GAME. LISA: HOW MUCH WAS UNDERPINNED SOME

13:45 OF THE FAULTY DECISION-MAKING, THIS RELIANCE ON FED MONETARY

13:49 POLICY IS A GUIDING LIGHT VERSUS THAT IS LESS OF A GAME

13:54 THEN THE PROFITS AND OTHER THINGS IN A NORMALIZED TYPE

13:55 ENVIRONMENT? JONATHAN:

14:01 DID YOU NOTICE WE ALREADY HAD THE FED MEETING IN WASHINGTON

14:03 WITH CHAIR YELLEN AND VICE CHAIR BIDEN? LISA:

14:05 PRETTY AWKWARD. JONATHAN: YES. DIDN'T GO UNNOTICED.

14:13 THINGS TO SAY ON INFLATION AND THE PATH BACK TO 2%, SOFT

14:14 LANDINGS. QUITE A TEAM, AY?

14:28 RIGHT NOW AND THE EQUITY MARKET, THE S&P 500 FUTURES ARE

14:35 POSITIVE. FROM NEW YORK CITY, GOOD

14:38 MORNING. THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

15:15 PRES. BIDEN:, I HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH

15:19 NETANYAHU AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T FORGET WHAT

15:21 WE ARE DOING HERE. WE HAVE TO SUPPORT ISRAEL,

15:27 BECAUSE THEY ARE AN INDEPENDENT NATION.

15:31 I THINK WE'VE MADE IT CLEAR TO THE ISRAELIS, THE SAFETY OF

15:33 INNOCENT PALESTINIANS IS STILL OF GREAT CONCERN. JONATHAN:

15:38 PRESIDENT BIDEN SPEAKING AT THE WHITE HOUSE AFTER COMMENTS AT A

15:41 FUNDRAISER IN WHICH HE ALLUDED TO ISRAEL LOSING GLOBAL SUPPORT

15:44 FOR INDISCRIMINATE BOMBINGS IN GAZA.

15:46 WE KNEW THAT THERE WAS SOME DIVIDE BEHIND THE SCENES, BUT

15:49 PUBLICLY WE ARE STARTING TO SEE IT MORE IN.

15:51 IT STARTED A FEW WEEKS AGO. THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS WITH

15:55 VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS. NOW YOU'RE HEARING IT FROM THE

15:56 PRESIDENT HIMSELF. TOM:

16:03 THE LAST 24 HOURS, IT IS SHOCKING OVER 12 MONTHS TO SEE

16:07 THE DIFFERENCE IN MR. ZELINSKI COMING TO WASHINGTON AS BEFORE.

16:11 I DIDN'T EXPECT IT AND LISA: HERE WE ARE. LISA:I

16:14 ALSO THINK WHEN IT COMES TO ISRAEL THERE IS THE QUESTION

16:17 ABOUT ENGINEMAN NETANYAHU DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF SUPPORT.

16:22 HE WAS MORE ON THE RIGHT WING AND HOW HE WILL POSITION GOING

16:25 FORWARD GIVEN THE FACT THAT HE'S TAKING A DIFFERENT STANCE

16:27 FROM WHAT PRESIDENT BIDEN WOULD LIKE TO SEE.

16:30 A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT IT HAS

16:33 TO WRAP UP IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND THAT SEEMS TO BE WHAT

16:34 PEOPLE ARE SAYING COLLECTIVELY. JONATHAN:

16:36 THE POLLS ARE SCREAMING. T.K.

16:42 IS SCREAMING. IN OPPOSITION TO THE

16:43 PRESIDENT'S STATS. FROM THE LATEST POLL HALF OF

16:47 THOSE SURVEYED SAID THAT THEY APPROVE OF ISRAEL'S MILITARY

16:49 ACTION IN GAZA. 45% OF AMERICANS DISAPPROVED.

16:54 THE KEY PART OF THE SURVEY IS 63% OF DEMOCRATS DISAPPROVED.

17:00 WE ARE GOING INTO AN ELECTION YEAR.

17:02 IT'S NO SHOCKER TO ME THAT THE PRESIDENT IS CHANGING HIS TONE.

17:06 TOM: I WAS THUNDERSTRUCK YESTERDAY

17:09 AND THE DAY BEFORE OF THE POLLING OF THE MAYOR OF NEW

17:13 YORK CITY, MR. ADAMS, GETTING LOW POLLS, MUCH BECAUSE OF THE

17:15 MIGRANT DEBATE IN NEW YORK CITY. THAT BRINGS IT TO THE BORDER

17:20 DEBATE THAT IS TIED INTO THE UKRAINE DEBATE.

17:23 THE POLLING ON THE BORDER IS DISTANT FROM THE ZEITGEIST

17:27 INSIDE THE BELTWAY. LISA: THIS FIGHT INTO THE AIR.

17:31 AID TO UKRAINE AND ISRAEL, CUTTING SPENDING, DOING

17:35 SOMETHING ABOUT THE SOUTHERN BORDER. TOM:

17:38 INTO THE NEW YEAR, THE BEGINNING OF THE PRESIDENTIAL

17:43 ELECTION, LOOK FOR OUR COVERAGE IN JANUARY AS WE LOOK TO IOWA

17:45 AND NEW HAMPSHIRE. IT IS A GOOD TIME TO CHECK UP

17:49 WITH SOMEONE STEEPED IN THE POLITICAL HISTORY OF AMERICA.

17:55 WENDY SCHILLER IS THE DIRECTOR . PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND.

18:01 HER TEXTBOOK DEFINITIVE ON TEACHING THE CIVICS THAT WE

18:02 HAVE FORGOTTEN. IF YOU LOOK AT OUR CIVICS OF

18:07 200 YEARS, IN THE MESS THAT WE ARE IN NOW THAT JON BEAUTIFULLY

18:11 STATED, WHAT HAVE WE MOST FORGOTTEN? WENDY:

18:16 WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE AMERICAN IDEAL, IT REQUIRES

18:23 TOLERANCE.

18:24 IT REQUIRES SAYING YOU DISAGREE WITH ME, BUT YOU AND I ARE BOTH

18:28 AMERICAN AND WE SHARE IN THESE FIRST AMENDMENT VALUES.

18:34 THE 10 BILL OF RIGHTS VALUES. THIS IS THE SYSTEM OF

18:35 GOVERNMENT THAT CAME FROM NOWHERE.

18:40 THE FOUNDERS PULLED FROM LOTS OF HISTORY, BUT NONETHELESS WE

18:44 AGREED THAT THE PRICE WE PAY, THE TICKET OF ENTRY INTO THIS

18:47 DEMOCRACY, IS TOLERANCE. WE CAN DISAGREE.

18:51 WE CAN WIN AND LOSE BATTLES POLITICALLY, BUT WE ALL HAVE

18:58 LEGITIMACY. THAT IS FRAYING IN A WAY THAT

19:03 IS DIFFERENT THAN HISTORICALLY. TOM:

19:09 ON UKRAINE IN THE BORDER, THE MIGRANT DEBATES, DO YOU SEE US

19:12 ENGAGING THIS DEBATE IN 2024? OR DO WE ENGAGE THE FIRST

19:16 WEDNESDAY OF NOVEMBER 2024? WENDY:

19:22 I THINK THAT WE ENGAGE IT THE MINUTE THAT DONALD TRUMP WINS A

19:27 PRIMARY OR CAUCUS AND GIVES AN ACCEPTANCE SPEECH THAT IS

19:31 COVERED BY EVERYBODY AND DONALD TRUMP BECOMES OUR DAILY GHOST,

19:36 WE GET A DIET OF DONALD TRUMP EVERY DAY MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY.

19:37 HOW DOES HE SPEAK? WE ALREADY SEE KEVIN MCCARTHY,

19:44 WHO I KNOW IS LEAVING, SAYING THAT REVENGE AND RETRIBUTION

19:46 WON'T WORK BECAUSE IT IS ANTITHETICAL TO WHAT PEOPLE

19:48 WANT TO BELIEVE ABOUT AMERICA. LET'S GO BACK TO RONALD REAGAN.

19:52 WE ARE OLD ENOUGH TO DO THAT AND THAT'S GOOD THEORETICALLY

19:57 SPEAKING. UNDERSTANDING WHICH MESSAGES

20:00 WORK IN TIMES OF DIFFICULTY. THE 1980'S WASN'T FUN.

20:05 16% INTEREST RATES COME THE HOSTAGE CRISIS, THE WORLD WAS

20:08 BECOMING LESS STABLE. RONALD REAGAN SAID WE COULD DO

20:11 IT, WE ARE EXCEPTIONAL, WE CAN DO IT. BUSH, SAME MESSAGE.

20:19 DOES DONALD TRUMP GO DARK AND NEGATIVE AND STILL MANAGED TO

20:20 WIN? LISA:

20:29 PRESIDENT BIDEN'S DECISION NOT TO STEP ASIDE AND LET ANOTHER

20:30 DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE TAKE HIS PLACE? WENDY:

20:34 I AM STILL DUG INTO THE IDEA THAT HE WON'T STEP ASIDE THOUGH

20:36 I'M STARTING TO WAVER A LITTLE BIT.

20:41 HE BELIEVES THAT HE IS THE MOST EXPERIENCED CANDIDATE, THE ONLY

20:42 PERSON WHO HAS ALREADY BEATEN DONALD TRUMP.

20:44 YOU HAVE TO SHAKE HIM OF THAT BELIEF.

20:48 IF THERE ARE POLL NUMBERS THAT SHOW THAT SOMEONE ELSE CAN DO

20:51 IT MORE EASILY AND DEFINITIVELY, I THINK HE WOULD

20:52 LISTEN. BUT CLEARLY, THERE AREN'T.

20:57 AT LEAST NO ONE IS SHOWING IT TO HIM AND NO ONE IS CLAIMING

21:01 OWNERSHIP OF THOSE POLL RATINGS. GAVIN NEWSOM, CALIFORNIA IS

21:06 VERY LIBERAL WITH ITS OWN PROBLEMS. HE MAY LOOK AND SOUND

21:11 GOOD ON TV, BUT IT'S A DIFFICULT SELL TO SAY THAT HE

21:14 HAS A BETTER CHANCE OF BEATING DONALD TRUMP THAN JOE BY THEN.

21:15 LISA: A POLL HAD A GENERIC DEMOCRAT

21:22 AGAINST DONALD TRUMP, AND THAT GENERIC DEMOCRAT WON.

21:27 AT WHAT POINT DOES IT BEHOOVE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY DEFINE THE

21:28 PERSON WHO CAN STEP IN? MAYBE THERE HASN'T BEEN THE

21:31 GROUND RESEARCH? WENDY:

21:38 IT WOULD BE A MUCH -- IT WOULD BE EASIER FOR THE BIDEN

21:42 ADMINISTRATION TO FIND A DIFFERENT AND VICE PRESIDENTIAL

21:48 CANDIDATE.

21:49 IF THERE WAS SOMEONE YOUNGER, MORE DYNAMIC WHO WAS MORE

21:54 POPULAR, LIKE A GOVERNOR LIKE RAPHAEL WARNOCK FROM GEORGIA.

21:58 IF THEY COULD ANNOUNCE THAT TRANSITION SAYING WE ARE

22:00 LOOKING TO A NEW TEAM, THAT MAY MOVE THE NEEDLE.

22:05 THAT MAY SAY TO VOTERS, HE IS LOOKING AHEAD AND UNDERSTANDING

22:07 THAT WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT SUCCESSION LOOKS LIKE BECAUSE

22:08 WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HIS AGE. JONATHAN:

22:11 THANK YOU FOR YOUR INPUT. HIGH-DEFINITION, ONE OF THE

22:15 MOST EXPERIENCED. HE WAS ELECTED IN 1972 TO THE

22:19 SENATE. FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS

22:22 COUNTRY, THAT IS A WEAKNESS AND NOT A STRENGTH. TOM:

22:25 IT IS THE GREAT DIVIDE AS A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY.

22:30 TOO MUCH WASHINGTON. ANOTHER GROUP IS SAYING, WHAT

22:32 DO WE HAVE OTHER THAN THAT EXPERIENCED?

22:35 IT COMES BACK TO THE JERRY AND SEA AND THE AGE OF THE TWO KEY

22:36 CANDIDATES. I WAS SAYING TO THIS YESTERDAY

22:42 WHEN SOMEONE CORNERED ME, DO YOU WORK WITH LISA ABRAMOWICZ?

22:44 I SAID YES. JONATHAN: THEY GET VERY EXCITED ABOUT

22:47 THAT. TOM: WHAT IS SHE REALLY LIKE?

22:51 JONATHAN: MEAN. LISA: A RAGING DIVA. TOM:

22:58 THE THING THAT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE DECEMBER

23:01 FIT MEETING IS THAT JANUARY IS HERE.

23:06 WENDY SCHILLER'S PROVIDENCE IS NOW.

23:12 AMORY IS IN IOWA -- ANNE-MARIE IS IN IOWA IN THREE WEEKS?

23:16 JONATHAN: I PERSONALLY DON'T SEE ANY GOOD

23:19 REASON TO THINK THAT THE LAST MILE IS GOING TO BE ESPECIALLY

23:21 DIFFICULT. THE LAST MILE OF THE INFLATION

23:24 PUSH. HERE IS VICE CHAIR BIDEN ON

23:27 FRIDAY FOLLOWING THE JOBS NUMBER.

23:29 THE SWEET SPOT THAT IS NEEDED FOR STABLE GROWTH NOT

23:35 ENCOURAGING THE FED TO RAISE INTEREST RATES.

23:37 THE BIDEN-YELLEN FED MEETING OF THE LAST FEW DAYS. LISA:

23:41 A LITTLE AWKWARD BECAUSE YOU WILL HEAR FROM FED CHAIR JAY

23:44 POWELL AND WE ARE NOT THERE YET. THE LAST MILE COULD PROVE TO BE

23:46 DIFFICULT. THERE IS A POLITICAL SELL IN

23:49 THE MESSAGE IS NOT GETTING THROUGH AND THERE IS A

23:51 FRUSTRATION AND YOU CAN HEAR THAT CONSISTENTLY.

23:55 PEOPLE ARE GETTING MORE FORCEFUL.

23:56 JANET YELLEN AND PRESIDENT BIDEN SAYING THE PRICES ARE

23:59 COMING DOWN IN CERTAIN AREAS AND INFLATION IS COMING LOWER.

24:01 IT IS NOT BREAKING THROUGH. TOM: I HAVE ADORED HER WORK.

24:10 WHERE IN GOD'S NAME IS HER VOICE IN THIS? JONATHAN:

24:17 A NICE BLOG POST THAT IS WORTH THE READ.

24:18 NOT INVISIBLE BUT SILENT A LOT OF THE TIME. TOM:

24:21 I ENJOYED WHEN SHE SPEAKS. JONATHAN:

24:25 TWO VERY SHARP INDIVIDUALS IN THE ECONOMY.

24:29 DON'T HEAR FROM THEM OFTEN ENOUGH. FROM NEW YORK, THIS IS

24:47 JONATHAN: A THREE-DAY WINNING STREAK ON

24:53 THE S&P FIVE DATE -- DAY FOUR. WE ARE LOOKING AT AN EQUITY

24:58 MARKET THAT'S AROUND 10% SINCE THE FED LAST MET AT THE START

25:01 OF NOVEMBER. WHAT A MOVE WE'VE SEEN BETWEEN

25:05 FED MEETINGS. LET'S SWITCH UP THE BOARD AND

25:11 GET TO THE BOND YEAR, TWO-YEAR, 10 YEAR, 30 YEAR.

25:13 THE TWO-YEAR IS DOWN ABOUT 30 BASIS POINTS, THE 10 YEAR DOWN

25:17 ABOUT 70. 41833 ON THE 10 YEAR.

25:23 TOM: THE 4.18 HAS MY ATTENTION. I WILL CALL IT QUIET SENT.

25:29 IF WE GO BACK TO EQUITY LEVELS, YOU MENTIONED THE THREE-DAY

25:33 TEAR BECAUSE WE ARE ALL ADDICTED TO THE SHORT TERM, I

25:36 WILL CALL IT THE 14 MONTH TEAR FROM OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR.

25:41 4700, 30 7000. -- 37,000. GIVE ME TWO CUPS OF COFFEE AND

25:49 WILL BE 17,000 ON THE NASDAQ. I DON'T HAVE -- I WON'T SPEAK

25:53 FOR OTHER PEOPLE -- I DON'T HAVE PERSPECTIVE ON THESE

25:54 LEVELS THAT WE ARE AT. JONATHAN: THE MARKET HAS MOVED QUICKLY TO

26:00 PRICE AND RATE CUTS FOR 2024 WHICH TEASE UP THE FED MEETING.

26:02 DO WE GET PUSHBACK LATER ON? LISA:

26:07 IF WE DON'T GET PUSHBACK WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT HOW THAT WILL

26:11 IGNITE THE NEXT LEG OF THE RALLY IN THE BOND MARKET.

26:19 IT ASKING FOR A LONG TIME, RIGHTLY SO.

26:20 IS THERE ANOTHER REASON WHY THE FED MAY NEED TO CUT RATES?

26:26 IF THERE IS, IS THAT CONCEPT BEING PRICED INTO A MARKET THAT

26:28 HAS DISCOUNTED THE BEARISH PLAYBOOK THAT WE CAME INTO THIS

26:30 YEAR WITH THAT WAS OFFENDED AND WRONG? JONATHAN:

26:35 NOT ALL RATE CUTS ARE CREATED EQUALLY.

26:38 THE FX MARKET, THE EURO AGAINST

26:44 THE DOLLAR, THE EURO AND 1.0 780.

26:45 THE FEDERAL RESERVE THIS AFTERNOON. TOMORROW, THE ECB.

26:53 OVERWHELMINGLY, THE PEOPLE WE SPEAK TO SUGGEST IF THEY CUT

26:54 THEY ARE GOING BEFORE THIS FED. LISA: THE ECONOMIC BACKDROP IS

26:59 LOOKING WORSE OVER THERE THAN OVER HERE.

27:01 THE DISINFLATION STORY IS GLOBAL.

27:05 IF THEY CONFIRM THAT, IS THE BIGGEST MOVE GOING TO BE IN THE

27:07 CURRENCY PAIR? JONATHAN: LET'S GET TO YOUR TOP STORIES

27:12 THIS MORNING. WE ARE COUNTING YOU DOWN TO THE

27:15 FINAL FED DECISION OF THE YEAR.

27:21 INVESTORS WILL BE LOOKING FOR CLUES ABOUT CUTS NEXT YEAR.

27:25 JAY POWELL SAYING IT IS TOO EARLY TO SPECULATE ON THE

27:26 TIMING OF THE FIRST RATE CUTS.

27:33 CITI WRITING, AND OUR BASE CASE THE FIRST 20 FIVE BASIS POINT

27:36 RATE IS DELIVERED IN JULY FOLLOWED BY CUTS AT EACH

27:38 SUBSEQUENT 2020 FOUR MEETING CUMULATING TO 100 BASIS POINT

27:41 TOTAL CUTS NEXT YEAR. TOM:

27:47 YOU GET BACK TO A QUARTER-POINT BALLET, AND YOU DON'T WANT TO

27:49 DO IT UNTIL YOU CAN GET PERSISTENCY OF CUTS, A SEQUENCE

27:52 OF CUTS.

27:58 I GO BACK TO A MORE TRADITIONAL VIEW OF WHY DON'T YOU CUT RATES

28:02 ITTY-BITTY, AND THEN SAY WE WILL STOP AND REASSESS.25 BASIS

28:05 POINTS . JONATHAN: IS THAT NOT WHAT WE ARE TALKING

28:08 ABOUT? TOM: NO, THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT

28:14 SEQUENCES OF RATE CUTS AND WE DON'T WANT TO MOVE UNTIL WE CAN

28:15 INITIATE SEQUENCE. GOOD LUCK WITH THAT. JONATHAN:

28:19 WE WILL HAVE THAT CONVERSATION IN A MOMENT.

28:24 TESLA, RECORDING 2 MILLION VEHICLES AND OFFERING A

28:27 SOFTWARE UPDATE AFTER U.S. REGULATOR SAID THAT NOT ENOUGH

28:30 IS BEING DONE TO PREVENT MISUSE OF THE AUTOPILOT SYSTEM.

28:35 THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ASSOCIATION CALLING

28:36 TESLA CONTROLS TO KEEP DRIVERS ENGAGED IN

28:49 ADEQUATE.IT IS THE SECOND RECALL THIS YEAR INVOLVING THE

28:50 TESLA AUTOMATIC DRIVING SYSTEMS, WHICH ARE COMING UNDER

28:52 SCRUTINY FOLLOWING HUNDREDS OF CRASHES, INCLUDING FATALITY.

28:53 THE STOCK IS DOWN ABOUT 1%. LISA: IT HAS BEEN BRUTAL.

28:55 SINCE THE END OF OCTOBER TESLA SHARES ARE ONLY UP 20%.

28:57 I'M SURE THEY ARE STRUGGLING. YOU ARE SEEING A LOT OF

29:01 SKEPTICISM. WE SAW THAT WITH GENERAL MOTORS

29:03 WITH THEIR AUTOPILOT VEHICLES IN SAN FRANCISCO.

29:09 I UNDERSTAND IT. IT IS THE IDEA OF A ROBOT

29:11 DRIVING FOR YOU THAT IS SCARY. AT THE SAME TIME, TO

29:17 EDITORIALIZE, WOULD YOU RATHER A ROBOT OR SOMEONE TEXTING, ON

29:19 THE PHONE, OR DRIVING FOR HALF OF THE YEAR? TOM:

29:25 WRAPPED UP IN ALL OF THE THINGS THAT MR. MUSKA IS DOING. TESLA,

29:29 76. GENERAL MOTORS 8.

29:35 JONATHAN: WE ARE MORE CRITICAL OF A NEW

29:37 TECHNOLOGY, AS WE SHOULD BE. BUT RECALLS OF 2 MILLION SOUNDS

29:40 LIKE A LOT. YOU REMEMBER THE AIRBAG FIASCO?

29:46 SOMETHING ABOUT 40 MILLION DEFECTIVE AIRBAGS?

29:48 DO YOU REMEMBER THAT? THAT'S BRUTAL. TOM:

29:53 YOU HAVE THIS ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY. THE TRUCK IS OUT.

29:56 ARE YOU TEST DRIVING IT? JONATHAN:

30:01 I THINK THE GUYS AT COP 28 WOULD LIKE US TO.

30:04 OFFICIALS AGREEING TO TRANSITION AWAY FROM FOSSIL

30:06 FUELS FOR THE FIRST TIME. THE MEETINGS PRESIDENT WARNING

30:11 THAT AN AGREEMENT IS ONLY AS GOOD AS IT GETS IMPLEMENTATION.

30:16 WE MUST TAKE THE STEPS NECESSARY TO TURN THIS INTO

30:17 TANGIBLE ACTION. AN AGREEMENT TO FACE COAL USAGE

30:23 TWO YEARS AGO HAS SEEN LITTLE CHANGE WITH COAL CONSUMPTION

30:24 CONTINUING TO RISE. WHAT YOU SAY IS ONE THING AT

30:27 WHAT YOU DO IS THE IMPORTANT THING. LISA: YES.

30:31 THAT SAID, THE FACT THAT THERE WAS A COMMITMENT AND RHETORIC

30:35 FROM THE LEADERS IN THE OIL WORLD IN PARTICULAR, WAS A

30:38 NOTABLE SHIFT THE FACT THAT IT WAS IN DUBAI WAS A NOTABLE

30:40 SHIFT. I DON'T REALLY FOLLOW THIS

30:45 BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN A NONSTORY FOR SO MANY YEARS AND

30:46 DISAPPOINTMENT. THERE WERE CONCRETE THINGS

30:51 SAID, WHICH WAS INTERESTING TO ME. TOM:

30:56 MIKE BLOOMBERG SIGNS OUR PAYCHECKS HERE AND HIS

30:57 LEADERSHIP IS SIMPLE. HE IS LOOKING SMALL.

31:03 ALL OF THE STUFF IS 60,000 FEET, AND I THINK THAT THE

31:05 SMALL PATH IS THE ONLY PATH THAT WE GOT.

31:09 THERE WAS NO AGREEMENT AT COP 28 FROM WHAT I COULD TELL.

31:12 COP 28. JOINING US NOW, THE CHIEF U.S.

31:16 ECONOMIST AT CITIGROUP.

31:22 THIS FED MEETING THAT WE WILL SEE TODAY, THE BOARDROOM, LOTS

31:25 OF HISTORY THERE, INCLUDING WORLD WAR II.

31:29 WHAT IS A WAR THAT WILL BE FOUGHT THERE TODAY? ANDREW:

31:33 THEY ARE TRYING TO COME TO SOME KIND OF CONSENSUS ABOUT WHEN

31:39 THEY WILL GUIDE MORE CLEARLY TOWARDS CUTS.

31:42 IT IS PRETTY CLEAR THAT IS THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL.

31:45 WE HEARD FROM GOVERNOR WALLER THE IDEA THAT IN HIS PUBLIC

31:48 COMMENTS IN THREE OR FIVE MONTHS HE WOULD BE CONVINCED

31:50 IT'S TIME TO START CUTTING RATES.

31:52 I DON'T THINK THAT THAT IS WHERE THE COMMITTEE'S OVERALL.

31:58 POWELL SAID IT IS PREMATURE TO DISCUSS RATE CUTS.

32:00 WE WILL PROBABLY HEAR SOMETHING SIMILAR TODAY. I DON'T INC.

32:05 THAT THAT IS A MESSAGE THAT WILL BE BELIEVED BY MARKETS.

32:09 I DON'T THINK IT IS MEANT TO BE BELIEVED BY MARKETS.

32:13 A LITTLE BIT OF AN AWKWARD POSITION, BECAUSE CLEARLY THE

32:15 NEXT MOVE WILL BE A CUT. TECHNICALLY, THE BIAS IS A

32:18 HIKING BIAS. THAT IS WHAT THEY HAVE TO

32:20 NAVIGATE TODAY. JONATHAN: LET'S TALK ABOUT GOVERNOR

32:24 WALLER WHO SAID THAT SOMETHING IS GIVING AT THE STATE OF THE

32:30 ECONOMY. ANDREW: IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA ON

32:35 HAND, EVERYTHING LOOKS STRONG WITH A STRONG JOBS REPORT.

32:40 GDP GROWTH IN THE FOURTH QUARTER SURPRISED EVERYONE.

32:43 IN THE FOURTH QUARTER IT LOOKS LIKE BETWEEN 1% AND 2%.

32:46 IT IS HARD TO LOOK AT THAT ECONOMY AND SAY THAT THINGS ARE

32:49 FALLING APART. IF YOU LOOK AT THE MORE

32:52 FORWARD-LOOKING INDICATORS LIKE THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE COMING UP

32:57 -- IT CAME DOWN LAST WEEK BUT IT IS STILL UP OFF OF ITS LOW,

33:01 CREDIT CARD DELINQUENCIES ARE RISING.

33:06 IF YOU TALK TO BUSINESSES AND PEOPLE, THERE IS A SENSE THAT

33:08 THINGS ARE SLOWING DOWN. WE ARE HEARING A LOT ABOUT MAY

33:12 BE THE FED WILL BE CUTTING INTEREST RATES BECAUSE OF

33:15 INFLATION. I THINK THE FED IS ULTIMATELY

33:18 GOING TO BE CUTTING INTEREST RATES BECAUSE OF ACTIVITY.

33:19 SLOWING. ECONOMIC WEAKNESS THAT IS

33:24 CONTRARY TO WHAT WALLER SAID. HE WAS TALKING ABOUT SHOULD WE

33:28 BE CUTTING IN THREE TO FIVE MONTHS?

33:30 HE EXPLICITLY SAID, I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT GROWTH, ABOUT

33:31 RECESSION. WE ARE NOT TRYING TO SAVE THE

33:35 ECONOMY. I THINK WHAT THEY ARE SEEING IS

33:39 THIS NARROW PATH TO A SOFT LANDING.

33:40 THEY THINK THAT THEY ARE ON THIS NARROW PATH TO A SOFT

33:43 LANDING. IF THEY DON'T START BRINGING

33:45 OUT THESE CUTS THEY AREN'T GOING TO BE ON THAT PATH

33:47 ANYMORE. THEY HAVE TO CONTORT THEMSELVES

33:51 TO MOVE FROM THE FED THAT WAS FIGHTING INFLATION AND WAS

33:53 FOCUSED ON INFLATION. SUPER COURT WAS GOING TO BE THE

33:55 GUIDING LIGHT.

34:01 SUPER CORE IS STILL HIGH. NOW THEY WANT TO CUT RATES.

34:06 WE ARE GETTING AN AWKWARD TRANSITION TODAY. JONATHAN:

34:10 I WANT TO BE CLEAR ON THE JOURNEY THAT YOU AND THE TEAM

34:13 HAVE BEEN ON. I REMEMBER WHEN YOU AND BANK OF

34:19 AMERICA CAME OUT HOW BIG THIS HIKING CYCLE WOULD BE.

34:22 WHEN I QUOTED YOU WORK A LOT OF PEOPLE ALMOST LAUGHED.

34:24 THEY DIDN'T THINK THE FED WOULD GO THIS FAR.

34:27 YOU HAVE CHANGED YOUR VIEWS. A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO WE WERE

34:30 LOOKING FOR ANOTHER MOVE OR TWO. YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT

34:33 INFLATION GOING INTO THE YEAR IN.

34:35 SURPRISED TO THE UPSIDE AGAIN. NEXT YEAR, WHERE ARE YOU ON

34:37 INFLATION? ANDREW: WE SEE INFLATION THAT IS

34:43 STAYING STUBBORNLY HIGH. IT IS SLOWER -- IT IS LOWER AND

34:47 THAT IS WHERE WALLER AND THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY IS SEEING

34:53 THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE WHERE INFLATION HAS

34:55 COME DOWN FASTER THAN EXPECTED. MOST OF THAT SURPRISE HAS BEEN

34:58 ON THE GOOD SIDE. GOODS INFLATION HAS COME DOWN

35:02 MAKING SENSE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE GLOBAL CONTEXT.

35:05 SLOWER INFLATION GLOBALLY BECAUSE GOODS INFLATION IS

35:08 LOWER AND THAT IS A GOOD THING. WHAT IS HOLDING UP IS SERVICE

35:10 SECTOR INFLATION. WE SAW THAT IN THE INFLATION

35:12 REPORT.

35:18 WE ARE RUNNING SO-CALLED SUPER CORE SERVICES.

35:20 SHELTER IS GETTING LESS ATTENTION THEN IT SHOULD BE

35:22 BECAUSE THERE IS A STRONG EXPECTATION THAT THAT WOULD

35:27 HAVE SLOWED BY MORE THAN IT HAS. IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS BOTTOMING.

35:33 WE LOOK AT THE FORD--- FORWARD-LOOKING RENT DATA AND

35:38 THE SHELTER PRICES COULD BE PICKING UP.

35:40 WE COULD HAVE STICKY INFLATION HERE THAT COULD EVEN ACCELERATE

35:41 IF THE ECONOMY KEEPS EXPANDING. IN OUR BASE CASE WE THINK THE

35:45 ECONOMY WILL SLOW DOWN AND THAT WILL BE THE KEY INFLATIONARY

35:50 FORCE. LISA: THE CUTS THAT YOU HAVE GAMED

35:53 OUT FOR NEXT YEAR PRICED AGAINST STAGFLATION? ANDREW:

35:58 I WOULD NOT CALL IT STAGFLATION IN THAT OUR BASE CASE CORE

36:03 INFLATION IS 3%. WE DON'T WANT TO COMPARE THAT

36:06 TO THE 1970'S WHEN WE HAD DOUBLE-DIGIT INFLATION.

36:08 THERE IS AN ELEMENT OF THAT. IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THIS KIND OF

36:13 INFLATION THAT JON IS TALKING ABOUT WITH THE FED SAYING WE

36:16 ARE GETTING CONCERNED ABOUT ACTIVITY, THEY MIGHT BE CUTTING

36:17 ALREADY. THEY MIGHT CUT EARLIER AND

36:19 FASTER. PART OF THE REASON WE HAVE THE

36:25 FIRST RATE CUT NOT UNTIL JULY AND 25 BASIS POINTS AT EACH

36:31 MEETING INSTEAD OF 50 BASIS POINTS OR 75 BASIS POINTS IS

36:38 THE IDEA THAT YOU ARE COMING AT IT WITH INFLATION TO HIDE. TOM:

36:43 YOU HAD ONE OF THE HIGHER RATES BASED OFF STIMULUS FROM COVID.

36:46 IS THIS A COVID FED MEETING STILL? ANDREW: GREAT QUESTION.

36:53 ON THE GOOD SIDE WE ARE LARGELY BEYOND THE COVID DISTORTIONS

36:58 WHICH IS WHY WE'VE GONE BACK TO A GOODS DISINFLATION.

37:03 WE MIGHT BE THIS INFLATING -- DISINFLATING FROM THE COVID

37:04 PRICES.

37:14 WHAT IS LOOKING LESS COVID-RELATED IS THE LABOR

37:18 MARKET AND THE SERVICE SECTOR. WE WERE SEEING THIS COVID

37:22 DISTORTION WHERE EVERY RESTAURANT WAS TRYING TO REOPEN

37:26 SO WE HAD RAPIDLY RISING WAGES AND PRICES AT RESTAURANTS.

37:27 THAT HAS NORMALIZED NOW BUT THAT'S THE PROBLEM AS WE SEE IT.

37:34 THE FED LOOKS AT IT AND SAYS, GOOD, THINGS ARE NORMALIZING.

37:36 WE SAY THAT THINGS ARE NORMALIZING.

37:40 IT'S NOT LIKE ONE OR TWO YEARS AGO, BUT WE STILL HAVE A TIGHT

37:44 LABOR MARKET AND WAGE GROWTH THAT IS INCONSISTENT WITH 2%

37:45 INFLATION. IT ISN'T CLEAR TO US THAT THIS

37:50 IS CONVERGING TO 2%. MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE 3% OR 4%.

37:54 JONATHAN: YOU THINK CHAIRMAN POWELL CARES

37:55 THAT STOCKS ARE UP 10%? ANDREW: IDEALLY HE WOULDN'T HAVE WANTED

38:01 FINANCIAL CONDITIONS TO LOOSEN THIS AGGRESSIVELY.

38:06 IT WAS ONLY AT THE NOVEMBER F1 SEE MEETING WHEN TIGHTER

38:07 FINANCIAL CONDITIONS WOULD DO SOME OF THE WORK FOR THE FED

38:09 AND THAT IS WHY THEY COULD BE LESS HAWKISH.

38:15 THOSE FINANCIAL CONDITIONS HAVE ALMOST FULLY REVERSED WITH 10

38:17 SLOWER WITH EQUITY PRICES HIGHER.

38:22 BECAUSE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE ECONOMY, IT IS HARD FOR

38:28 POWELL TO STRONGLY PUSH BACK AGAINST THIS.

38:30 WE GET THE SYMMETRY WHERE FINANCIAL CONDITIONS TIGHTENING.

38:33 WITH THE FED WE HAD POLICYMAKERS IN GENERAL WHO

38:36 WORKED VERY HARD TO STOP THE ACUTE TIGHTENING OF FINANCIAL

38:37 CONDITIONS. THE FINANCIAL CONDITIONS HAVE

38:39 LOOSENED. IN POWELL'S MIND HE SAYS WHAT

38:42 IS THE RISK? WE RUN HIGHER INFLATION.

38:45 IF WE SEE THAT IN THE DATA WE WILL DEAL WITH THAT AT THAT

38:46 TIME. JONATHAN: THIS IS GREAT. IT IS GOOD TO SEE YOU, IT

38:50 ALWAYS IS. THE EQUITY MARKET UP SOMETHING

38:59 LIKE 10% SINCE THE FED LAST MET. REGIONAL BANKS ARE UP 20% SINCE

39:02 THEN.

39:17 >> REALLY STALLED AT THIS POINT. IT IS A CRITICAL PART OF THE

39:19 ECONOMY. IF BANKS ARE SIDELINED WE WILL

39:22 SEE AN EXPOSED WEAKER HAND OVER THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF THIS

39:25 YEAR. JONATHAN: THOSE THE HEAD OF U.S.

39:28 MICROSTRATEGY. THE FEDERAL RESERVE LATER THIS

39:34 AFTERNOON, A THREE-PART STORY. STATEMENT, PROJECTIONS, AND A

39:39 NEWS CONFERENCE WITH CHAIRMAN POWELL.

39:40 THEN, FOR MANY YEAR OVER THOUGH AS BRAMO WILL REMIND YOU THE

39:45 ECB IF THAT TAKES YOUR FANCY. FUTURES ARE POSITIVE ON THE S&P.

39:53 A MINOR, NO DRAMA MOVE THIS MORNING, BUT OVER THE LAST

39:56 MONTH OR SO, SINCE THE FED LAST MET, WE HAVE SEEN A MOVE OF

40:00 ABOUT 10% ON THE S&P 500. IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT THE

40:05 REGIONALS, THE KR EE, THE BANKS IN AMERICA, UP BY MORE THAN 20%

40:08 SINCE EARLY NOVEMBER. TOM:

40:16 I LOOKED AT THE CHARTS, AND THE TWO BASIC INDEXES THAT THEY

40:19 HAVE, AND I GET THE BOUNCE UP, BUT IT'S STUNNING HOW FAR WE

40:21 WENT DOWN AND HOW FAR WE HAVE TO GO TO GET BACK.

40:25 IT IS A LONG WAYS AWAY. JONATHAN:

40:30 ALL OF THIS OFF OF THE BACK OF THE BOND MARKET MOVE.

40:31 IT HAS BEEN PHENOMENAL. TOM: THE BOND MARKET MOVE IS

40:35 CORRELATED IN. THERE IS A FEELING OUT THERE

40:38 THAT SOMEONE WILL SAVE EVERYBODY.

40:39 IS THAT STILL OUT THERE? I REMEMBER THEY SHUT DOWN 10

40:44 BANKS IN A WEEKEND. I REMEMBER IN THE 1970'S BOB

40:49 SEEGER ON THE RADIO, YOU COULD SEE THROUGH THE FLOOR OF YOUR

40:51 CAR BECAUSE YOU ARE BROKE, YOU LOOK AT A BANK, ARE THEY GOING

40:55 TO BE IN BUSINESS ON MONDAY? THERE IS NONE OF THAT TENSION.

40:58 JONATHAN: WE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF THAT

41:01 STRESS IN THE SPRING. WE DON'T HAVE THAT STRESS IN

41:02 QUITE THE SAME WAY. TOM:

41:10 KBW ARE THE INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR. DO YOU LOOK AT J.P.

41:13 MORGAN OR DO YOU IGNORE?

41:15 >> YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT IT. TOM: MID-CAPS, I WANT TO GO TO

41:20 TACOMA, WASHINGTON. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE TO, IS

41:23 ON THE MAP. COLUMBIA BANKING SYSTEM.

41:28 WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO BE IN A YEAR?

41:31 WHERE ARE THE MID-CAPS LIKE COLUMBIA BANKING GOING TO BE IN

41:32 FIVE YEARS?

41:37 >> CONSOLIDATION IS PART OF THE QUESTION.

41:40 COLUMBIA HAS DOUBLED OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS.

41:42 WE THINK THAT SCALE IS IMPORTANT IN THIS INDUSTRY.

41:46 WE HAVE DONE A LOT OF WORK AND THERE IS A STRONG CORRELATION

41:48 BETWEEN THE SIZE OF YOUR BANK AND THE DEGREE OF PROFITABILITY

41:52 AND MARKET REWARDS SCALE. THEY ALSO PUNISH SCALE AND

41:56 REGULATION IS ONE THING WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH OUT OF THE COVID.

41:59 JONATHAN: HAVE YOU BEEN SURPRISED BY HOW

42:02 LITTLE CONSOLIDATION WE'VE SEEN BETWEEN THE STRESS OF SPRING

42:03 AND NOW? CHRIS: NO, I THINK IT IS AN EVOLUTION.

42:10 SPRING WAS FORCED CONSOLIDATION. FAILURES, THREE OR FOUR

42:11 FAILURES.

42:17 AS SPRING PICKS UP THE FAILURES, WE WILL SEE

42:18 CONSOLIDATION. THE INDUSTRY STILL HAS 4000

42:21 BANKS.THAT IS THE ONLY DEVELOPED COUNTRY IN THE WORLD

42:25 WITH THIS LEVEL OF FRAGMENTATION.

42:27 ONE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF FAILURES IN STRESSES IS THAT WE

42:31 NEED TO PICK UP THE PIECES AND MOVE FORWARD. LISA:

42:34 WHAT IS THE RIGHT NUMBER OF BANKS? CHRIS: FEWER.

42:39 WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT THE NUMBER OF BANKS IS THAT WE NEED

42:44 MORE COMPETITION FOR THE TOP THREE OR FOUR.

42:46 THE BIGGEST ARE THE MOST REGULATED IN THE WORLD.

42:49 THERE IS A GENERAL HESITATION BY THE REGULATORS TO LET THE

42:51 BIGGER BANKS GET BIGGER.

42:57 THE REGIONALS, THEY NEED TO BE BIGGER TO COMPETE MORE

42:58 EFFECTIVELY WITH THE JP MORGAN'S AND WELLS FARGO'S OF

43:01 THE WORLD. WE THINK THAT ONCE THE RULES

43:04 ARE WRITTEN ON REGULATION, THERE IS A LOT OF PUSHBACK ON

43:07 REGULATION. THAT IS AN OPPORTUNITY OVER THE

43:11 NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. LISA:

43:13 WHERE IS THE GROWTH GOING TO COME FROM?

43:16 DEPOSITS, CONSUMER LENDING, WITH FROM WHERE THEY HAVE

43:18 COMPETITION FROM PRIVATE EQUITY FIRMS? CHRIS:

43:21 IN THE NEAR TERM, I DON'T THINK THERE WILL BE A LOT OF GROWTH,

43:25 TO BE CANDID. THEY HAD CREDIT FIRST AND

43:29 DELEVERAGING SECOND. WE ARE DELEVERAGING, SHRINKING

43:36 BALANCE SHEETS, RAISING CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY.

43:37 GOING FORWARD THAT WILL BE A CHALLENGE FOR THE NEXT ONE TO

43:40 TWO YEARS. TOM: YOUR SHOP COVERS THE LARGER

43:41 REGIONALS. WHEN DO THEY FINALLY MERGE TO

43:47 COMPETE WITH THE LARGER BANKS? WE USED TO HAVE FIVE OR SIX OR

43:52 SEVEN MAJOR BANKS AND NOW WE HAVE FOUR WITH AN ASTERISK.

43:57 WE HAVE TO GET MORE MAJOR BANKS. WHEN DO THE PNC'S GET TO PLAY?

44:02 CHRIS: BASEL THREE IS A BIG DEVELOPMENT BEING DEBATED NOW.

44:10 NEAR TERM, WITH A CREDIT UNCERTAINTY IN THE ECONOMY,

44:11 PENCILS ARE DOWN FOR M&A. OVER TIME, THERE WILL BE MORE

44:14 CONSOLIDATION. JONATHAN: WE HAVE TO GET MORE MAJOR BANKS.

44:19 DOES ANYONE IN WASHINGTON AGREE? TOM: NO, NO.

44:24 EVERY OTHER NATION HAS DONE THIS. JONATHAN: I AM WITH YOU.

44:27 I GET THAT. DO WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHY WE

44:32 ARE SITTING HERE IN THIS SOLE LONELY DEVELOPED NATION WITH

44:37 4000 BANKS? SOMEONE WANTS US TO BE HERE.

44:40 CHRIS: FROM 2000 EIGHT, THE GLOBAL

44:43 FINANCIAL CRISIS, THE SYSTEMIC LEVEL WAS PUTTING A LINE IN THE

44:47 SAND. THAT WAS WALKED BACK IN 2016

44:49 AFTER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. WITHOUT GETTING POLITICAL,

44:54 THERE IS A LEVEL OF POLITICAL CONSIDERATION TO THINK ABOUT.

44:57 TOM: BEING IN LONDON AS PAPERBACK

45:01 WRITER WAS RELEASED BY THE BEATLES, I REMEMBER THERE WERE

45:05 NO BANKS.THERE IS A BANK IN AMERICA ON EVERY CORNER.

45:07 JONATHAN: YOU ARE BRINGING UP A DIFFERENT

45:10 CONVERSATION. THE

45:18 FOOTPRINT ON HIGH STREET AND MAIN STREET HAVE CHANGED. CHRIS:

45:22 YOU ARE SEEING SMALLER AND FEWER, BUT THERE IS A LOT OF

45:25 REGULATION AND YOU HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO FAIR LENDING AND

45:28 MAKING SURE THAT A BANK HAS EXPOSURE IN CERTAIN POCKETS OF

45:30 THE ECONOMY IN DIFFERENT MARKETS. LISA:

45:35 WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGE TO HAVING STRONG REGIONAL BANKS?

45:37 THERE IS A QUESTION OVER WHETHER BANKS HAVE BEEN SAVED

45:40 AGAIN AND AGAIN, PARTICULARLY ON THE SMALLER ENDS, THAT DID

45:46 NOT HEDGE APPROPRIATELY TO INTEREST-RATE EXPOSURE THAT

45:48 INVESTED IN COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE THAT WAS FAULTY.

45:52 THOSE ACTIVITIES ARE MOVING TO OTHER INVESTMENT FIRMS. WHAT IS

45:55 THE ARGUMENT FOR BEEFING UP THIS INDUSTRY?

45:59 CHRIS: THE SMALLER BANKS ARE THE LIFEBLOOD OF THE ECONOMY.

46:04 JP MORGAN, CITIGROUP, WELLS FARGO, POWERFUL INSTITUTIONS.

46:07 YOU DO NEED THE LOCAL, SMALL BANK TO GIVE CUSTOMER SERVICE.

46:10 A LOT OF MISTAKES WERE MADE WITH INTEREST RATE RISK AND

46:15 MANAGEMENT, AND THOUGH SHAREHOLDERS AND THOSE

46:18 COMPANIES PAID THE ULTIMATE PRICE.

46:19 I THINK FOR A HEALTHY, THRIVING ECONOMY YOU NEED MORE SCALE AND

46:22 SIZE ACROSS THE GAMUT. TOM: THE THREE OF US, WE HAVE NOT

46:28 BEEN IN A BRANCH SINCE THE RED SOX WERE IN FIRST PLACE.

46:30 JONATHAN: SPEAK FOR YOURSELF. TOM: WE DO EVERYTHING DIGITALLY,

46:37 ZELLE THIS, ZELLE THAT. HOW DOES TACOMA, WASHINGTON

46:42 COMPETE WITH THE DIGITAL INVESTMENT OF THE MAJOR BANKS?

46:46 CHRIS: THE SMALLER BANKSCHRIS: -- THE BIGGER BANKS ARE GOING

46:50 TO MOVE FIRST AND THE SMALLER BANKS WILL ADAPT.

46:55 SECOND, THEY HAVE BUILT OUT CAPABILITIES TO COMPETE

46:56 EFFECTIVELY. MAYBE NOT TO THE SOPHISTICATION

46:58 OF INTERNATIONAL BANKS. TOM: WHAT IS A CAPABILITY THAT THEY

47:05 HAVE IN THE COMA, WASHINGTON WHERE THEY DON'T WANT BRIAN

47:06 MOYNIHAN TO COME IN FROM THE BANK OF AMERICA? CHRIS:

47:12 TURN AND ONLINE SPEED FOR DEPOSIT CAPTURE.

47:14 I HAVE NOT BEEN IN A BRANCH EITHER IN YEARS.

47:25 THE CAPABILITIES FOR YOU AND I AS A CONSUMER, THE SMALLER

47:27 BANKS CAN ACCOMMODATE THAT. THEY MAY NOT HAVE THE BUDGET

47:29 INITIALLY, BUT THEY WILL. JONATHAN:

47:33 WE ARE STILL DOWN 25% FROM THE HIGHS OF THE YEAR.

47:37 ANY REASON TO BELIEVE WE RECLAIM THOSE HIGHS NEXT YEAR?

47:51 CHRIS: WE ARE MARKET WEIGHT THE U.S.

47:52 BANKS. THIS IS THE ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF MOVING TO MARKET

47:53 WEIGHT. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN OVER THE PAST

47:54 12 MONTHS IS A 30 POINT DIVERGENCE BETWEEN THE S&P AND

47:56 THE BANKS. THE SPRING WAS ABOUT NET

47:56 INTEREST MARGIN, NET INTEREST DEPOSIT.

47:59 THAT LEG OF THE RELAY RACE HAS PLAYED OUT AND STABILIZED.

48:01 WHAT WE ARE FEELING NOW IS, WHAT IS CREDIT GOING TO LOOK

48:06 LIKE AS INTEREST RATES HAVE RISEN? HOW MUCH OF A CREDIT

48:08 NORMALIZATION PROCESS WILL WE GO THROUGH?

48:11 HOW MUCH WILL THIS WAY ON EARNING ESTIMATES GOING FORWARD?

48:14 THE KEY FOR US IS EARNINGS TAKE THE DIRECTION OF THE STOCKS.

48:20 JONATHAN: NOT THE 10 YEAR YIELD? IT HAS BEEN AMAZING.

48:21 ALL OF IT PRETTY MUCH OFF THE BACK OF THIS MOVE IN THE BOND

48:22 MARKET. LISA: AND COUNTERINTUITIVE BECAUSE

48:27 USUALLY HIGHER RATES WERE GOOD FOR BANKS.

48:30 NOW LOWER RATES ARE BETTER FOR BANKS. THIS IS DEFAULT RISK.

48:34 THIS IS CONCERN ABOUT WITHDRAWALS OF CONSUMER

48:36 DEPOSITS. THIS IS CONCERN ABOUT BREAKING

48:38 THE SYSTEM. IF THAT IS TAKEN OFF THE TABLE

48:41 PEOPLE CAN GET MORE OPPORTUNISTIC. JONATHAN:

48:45 ANY REASON FOR THAT TO CHANGE ANYTIME SOON, THE CORRELATION

48:46 BETWEEN BONDS AND REGIONALS? CHRIS:

48:51 THE QUESTION OF WHY RATES ARE COMING DOWN, BECAUSE INFLATION

48:55 IS MODERATING OR GROWTH IS SLOWING?

48:58 IF WE GET A SOFT ISSUE LANDING, KBW WAS IN THE CAMP OF SOFT

49:03 ISH, IT CAN WORK. IF WE SEE SOMETHING BREAK IN

49:08 THE MARKETS, CREDIT IS A BIG WILDCARD. JONATHAN:

49:13 A BIG CHANGE IN THE LAST MONTH IN THIS MARKET WITH MORE STILL

49:15 TO COME ON THE EQUITY MARKET. COMING UP IN THE NEXT HOUR,

49:19 LACK ROCK. STOCKS THIS MORNING A POSITIVE

49:25 0.1% ON THE S&P 500. FROM NEW YORK, THIS IS

49:35 BLOOMBERG.

49:45 >> RIGHT NOW IT IS A FED PIVOT PARTY, AND WE ARE ALL INVITED.

49:49 >> WE HAVE HIT RATES, PEAK FED, INFLATION IS SLOWING.

49:53 >> INFLATION INVOLVED OR MODERATING.

49:55 I DON'T THINK THAT WE ARE GOING BACK TO WHERE WE WERE IN 2019.

50:01 >> IF WE SEE STABILITY IN INFLATION AND WE MOVE THE 2024,

50:04 WE SEE AN UPTICK, THAT COULD FORCE THE FED'S HAND TO TAKE

50:07 ONE FINAL RATE INCREASE.

50:11 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE WITH TOM KEENE,

50:12 JONATHAN FERRO, AND LISA ABRAMOWICZ. JONATHAN:

50:17 I GET EXCITED ABOUT THE HOLIDAYS.

50:19 THE LAST FED DECISION OF 2023. GOOD MORNING, GOOD MORNING.

50:23 THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE. LIVE ON TV AND RADIO ALONGSIDE

50:28 TOM KEENE AND LISA ABRAMOWICZ, I AM JONATHAN FERRO.

50:33 YOUR EQUITY MARKET POSITIVE BY ZERO POINT 1%.

50:35 THIS AFTERNOON, CHAIRMAN POWELL IS STARING DOWN THE BARREL OF A

50:39 MARKET PRICING BIG RATE CUTS IN 2024 FOLLOWING A MASSIVE RALLY

50:41 SINCE THE LAST FED MEETING. TOM: YOU SAID YOU WERE LOOKING AT

50:47 THE TESTIMONY OF VICE CHAIR BY THEN AND CHAIR YELLEN AS WELL

50:49 AS A LITTLE BIT OF POLITICAL BALLET IN WASHINGTON.

50:52 THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT MONETARY POLICY. JONATHAN:

50:56 THIS WAS CHAIR YELLEN. CAN YOU IMAGINE IF CHAIR POWELL

50:59 SAID THE SAME THING TODAY? I CAN'T IMAGINE THE LAST MILE

51:01 WILL BE DIFFICULT. A SOFT LANDING IN THE ECONOMY

51:08 -- A SOFT LANDING AND THE ECONOMY CONTINUING TO GROW. TOM:

51:15 ALL OF THESE PEOPLE WITH UCLA AND CITIGROUP HAVE A HERITAGE.

51:17 YOU MENTIONED WALLER. WALLER IS BULLETPROOF ST. LOUIS

51:25 RESEARCH STUDIES, ACADEMIC RESEARCH. SO IS YELLEN.

51:30 SHE IS A VOICE ON LABOR ECONOMICS.

51:32 CHAIRMAN POWELL, NOT SO MUCH. JONATHAN:

51:38 THE PARTY STARTED, CHAIRMAN WALLER SHOWS UP WITH TEQUILA,

51:39 OFF TO THE RACES.

51:41 LISA: THAT IS WHAT WE HEARD, IT IS A

51:47 FED PIVOT PARTY AND WE ARE ALL INVITED.

51:48 I HAVE BEEN INVITED TO A DIFFERENT PARTY.

51:51 THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF PUSHBACK.

51:53 THERE IS THE FEELING OF A SOFT LANDING AND NOW YOU CAN FEEL

51:56 THE FRUSTRATION IN THE WHITE HOUSE. COME ON, THE REST OF THE

52:01 POPULATION, GET ON BOARD WITH THE SOFT LANDING.

52:02 CHAIRMAN JAY POWELL WILL NOT COMMENT AT ALL BUT THIS WILL BE

52:05 THE KEY QUESTION. WILL WE GET RATE CUTS FOR THE

52:08 RIGHT REASON? WILL PEOPLE START TO QUESTION

52:11 WHY THEY ARE PRICING A BUNCH OF BASIS POINTS FOR RATE CUTS?

52:16 ANDREW HAD THE SAME YEAR AND PROJECTION FOR RATE CUTS AS IS

52:18 PRICED IN FOR THE MARKET BUT THE REASON WHY IS DIFFERENT.

52:21 TOM: I WISH THAT THEY WOULD ESTABLISH THE REALITY, WHICH IS

52:29 WHAT THE FANCY PEOPLE CALL EX-POST, AFTER THE FACT.

52:33 HE SAYS WE BY CODE HAVE TO BE AFTER THE FACT.

52:37 WE DON'T KNOW IF IT IS THIS MEETING OR THAT MEETING OR THE

52:40 OTHER, BUT EVERYONE CALM DOWN BECAUSE WE WILL BE LATE.

52:44 THAT IS THE FACT WE HAVE TO LIVE WITH. JONATHAN:

52:50 STATEMENT, PROJECTION, NEWS CONFERENCE THIS AFTERNOON.

52:52 THE S&P 500 FUTURES ARE POSITED BY .1%.

52:58 ON THE 10-YEAR, 4.1776. LISA:

53:05 WE HAVE NOT MENTIONED CPI WANT WITH -- ONES WHICH TELLS YOU

53:09 HOW SURPRISING IT WAS, IT WASN'T.

53:12 AN INTERESTING WAY TO LOOK AT MARGINS FOR COMPANIES.

53:16 IF YOU SEE A TICK UP IN TERMS OF INFLATION ON PRODUCTS AND

53:19 YOU DON'T SEE THE SAME IN CONSUMER PRICES, THAT IS MARGIN

53:23 COMPRESSION. 1:30 THE FED DECIDES BEGINS, WE

53:29 WILL BE BACK ON AIR WITH THE DRUMBEAT TO THE FED DECISION.

53:34 BILL DUDLEY, THE FORMER NEW YORK FED PRESIDENT.

53:39 ALL GIVING SOME KEY INDICATORS OF WHAT TO WATCH AND HOW TO

53:40 UNDERSTAND. 2:00 P.M. IS THE RATE DECISION.

53:46 WE WILL LOOK AT THE STATE OF ECONOMIC REJECTIONS.

53:51 DO THEY HAVE 50 BASIS POINTS OF CUTS? NO ONE WILL REALLY CARE.

53:56 JAY POWELL COME OUT AND TRY TO DO THIS DANCE.

53:58 I DON'T KNOW WHAT CHRIS WHILE THERE IS SAYING, WE ARE

54:01 INDEPENDENT, WE WILL TAKE THINGS AS THEY COME.

54:03 HOW THE MARKET RESPONSE MIGHT BE MORE INTERESTING. JONATHAN:

54:08 FIXATED ON THE 2024 DOT. IF THE DOT MOVES TOWARDS THE

54:14 MARKET, WHICH MOST ASSUME IT WILL, THE MARKET CAN GO ONE WAY.

54:17 THEN CHAIRMAN POWELL AND THE NEWS CONFERENCE CAN PUSHBACK AS

54:21 MUCH AS HE LIKES. TOM: A VIC'S PRINT OF 11 YESTERDAY,

54:25 I THINK THAT THE MARKET IS GETTING IN FRONT OF WHAT YOU

54:26 SAID. JONATHAN: SOMETHING LIKE 10% ON THE S&P

54:31 500 SINCE THE FED LAST-MINUTE. GOOD MORNING.

54:39 LET'S START WITH A RATE CUT CALL.

54:41 THE BACK HALF OF NEXT YEAR, WHAT ARE THE REASONS THAT

54:43 UNDERPIN IT?

54:46 >> THE MAIN REASON IS WE DON'T THINK THAT THE FED HAS TALKED

54:51 ABOUT HOW MUCH DECELERATION HAS TAKEN PLACE.

54:53 I KNOW THAT YOU SPEAK ABOUT THIS A LOT.

54:57 ARE THEY GOOD OR BAD REASONS? BAD REASONS IS A SHOCK TO

55:02 GROWTH. WE THINK THAT IT WILL BE FOR

55:04 THE GOOD REASONS. INFLATION COMING DOWN.

55:08 WE ARE ALREADY SEEING THAT. LISA, YOU SAID NO ONE CARED

55:11 ABOUT THE CPI DATA, BUT WE DID. THE SIX MONTH ANNUALIZED CPI ON

55:17 THE CORE IS DOWN 2.9%, GOOD NEWS FOR THE FED.

55:21 I THINK THAT THEY WILL BEGIN TO RECALIBRATE.

55:24 THAT IS ABOUT 50 TO 75 BASIS POINTS LOWER FOR 2024.

55:27 THEY START DOING THAT BY PERHAPS THE JUNE MEETING.

55:29 JONATHAN: YOU SAID 2023? 2024?

55:36 GARGI: IT CONTINUES TO BE A YIELD OF

55:40 DREAMS. FIXED INCOME DID NOT -- AT LEAST IN THE BEGINNING -- IT

55:45 DIDN'T QUITE HAVE THE YEAR THAT WE HOPED, BUT BY THE END OF THE

55:49 YEAR WE STARTED SEEING YIELDS MOVE LOWER.

55:51 I THINK 2024 CONTINUES TO BE THE YEAR OF INCOME, THE YEAR

55:55 WHERE BONDS GENERATE, ESPECIALLY HIGH QUALITY BONDS,

55:59 GENERATE THAT RETURN FOR YOU. I THINK 2024 IS ALSO THE YEAR

56:03 THAT INVESTORS STEP OUT OF CASH. THAT IS WHAT I'M THE MOST

56:05 EXCITED ABOUT. ALL OF THE HOARDING OF CASH

56:09 THAT WE'VE SEEN, THE ONE TRILLION THAT WE'VE SEEN.

56:13 I THINK THAT THIS IS THE YEAR THAT INVESTORS FEEL COMFORTABLE

56:15 STEPPING OUT INTO THE EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME MARKETS. TOM:

56:22 MY DOUBLE MAJOR IN COLLEGE WAS ICE HOCKEY AND LED ZEPPELIN.

56:25 YOU HAVE THE BEST DOUBLE MAJOR OF ANYONE WE'VE TALKED TO,

56:27 ACCOUNTING AND PSYCHOLOGY. THAT IS SO WARPED I DON'T KNOW

56:30 WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT. THE PSYCHOLOGY THAT YOU NAILED

56:35 THIS YEAR, AND YOU BRING IT OVER TO GET OUT OF CASH, AND

56:39 WHAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT BUT YOU ARE DIRECT ABOUT, YOU

56:41 HAVE TO FIND THE LOVABLE LEDGES THAT HAVEN'T MOVED.

56:48 WHAT IS OUR PSYCHOLOGY TO FINALLY BUY THOSE. GARGI:

56:56 THE LOVABLE LAGGARDS ARE SOME OF THOSE SECTORS OR GEOGRAPHIES

56:59 THAT DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE RALLIES.

57:01 HEALTH CARE IS ONE THAT WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT WITH GOOD

57:03 EARNINGS GROWTH PROJECTED FOR 2024.

57:06 WHEN WE LOOK AT SOME OF THE DETAILS FOR PHARMACEUTICALS, WE

57:11 FIND THAT SOME OF THE QUALITY CHARACTERISTICS, CASH FLOW,

57:14 BALANCE SHEET, CASH STRENGTH ARE AVAILABLE.

57:17 IT DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE

57:23 SAME WAY THAT WE SAW THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN OR THE TECH

57:25 AND COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES SECTOR.

57:27 WE THINK THAT CERTAIN PARTS OF THE HEALTH CARE SECTOR CAN BE A

57:33 REALLY GOOD LAG -- LAGGARD FOR 2024.

57:37 IT MAY NOT START IMMEDIATELY. WE MAY NEED TO SEE A LITTLE

57:41 ASSURANCE FROM THE FED THAT NO MORE HIKING IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

57:44 I THINK THAT THAT COULD BE AN AREA OF THE MARKET THAT CATCHES

57:49 UP. LISA: I LOVE YOUR CALL THAT CASH WILL

57:52 NO LONGER BE THE MOST IMPORTANT ASSET CLASS.

57:54 THAT MONEY WILL START FLOWING OUT.

57:58 WHAT WILL THE TRIGGER BE GIVEN THAT TO YOUR ARE 4.7%? GARGI:

58:02 THIS RECOGNITION. WE DID THIS ANALYSIS THAT THERE

58:06 HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF LACK OF URGENCY.

58:08 THERE HAS BEEN A VIEW THAT RATES ARE GOING TO STAY MUCH

58:09 HIGHER FOR MUCH LONGER.

58:15 YOU ARE BETTER OFF SITTING IN CASH AND THEREBY MISSING OUT ON

58:16 THE RALLY IN THE EQUITY MARKETS. THIS YEAR WAS THE PRIME EXAMPLE

58:20 OF WHY YOU NEEDED TO STEP OUT OF CASH, BECAUSE YOU MISSED

58:25 THIS INCREDIBLE RALLY IN HIGH-QUALITY PARTS OF THE

58:26 MARKET. I THINK THAT THE RECOGNITION

58:31 THAT THE FED IS INDEED DONE, THAT THERE IS NO RISK OF A 6%

58:35 FED FUNDS RATE, NO RISK OF THEM DOING SOMETHING SHOCKING --

58:41 WHICH CONTINUES TO PUSH INTEREST RATES HIGHER OR EQUITY

58:45 MARKETS LOWER -- THAT RECOGNITION WILL HELP INVESTORS

58:48 STEP OUT OF CASH INTO WE BELIEVE FIXED INCOME MARKETS,

58:52 LIKE WE SAW THIS YEAR AND ETF INFLOWS IN FIXED INCOME, AND

58:57 HIGH-QUALITY PARTS AND SOME LOVABLE LAGGARDS. LISA:

59:00 ARE WE GOING TO SEE BIG TECH LEAD AGAIN?

59:04 ASIDE FROM THE CREDIT SIDE, IS IT GOING TO BE MONEY CHASING

59:06 RETURNS FROM 2023? JONATHAN: IF WE LOOK AT WHERE THE

59:10 EARNINGS GROWTH IS COMING FROM, THEY TEND TO LEAVE THE AREAS OF

59:14 THE MARKET THAT HAVE THE LOWEST LEVERAGE AND STRONGEST BALANCE

59:18 SHEET. JON, WAS TALKING ABOUT MARGINS,

59:21 THAT HAVE THE BEST MARGINS. SOME OF THOSE ARE IN THE LARGE

59:25 CAP PART OF THE MARKET.

59:32 NOT JUST TECH ALL LARGE CAPS.

59:40 IT IS NOT A TECH STORY BUT AND LARGE CAP STORY.

59:41 THERE CAN BE OUTPERFORMANCE IN THE FIRST MONTHS OF THE YEAR.

59:45 YOU HAVE TO PAIR THAT WITH SOME OF THE LAGGARDS.

59:49 THAT IS HOW WE THINK INVESTORS SHOULD PLAY THIS.

59:53 TOM: I REMEMBER GOING TO SOME OF THE

59:57 FIRST ETF MEETINGS P THEY THREW ME OUT BECAUSE IT WAS A SCAM.

01:00:04 IT IS NOT A SCAM HERE, IT IS HERE AND WONDERFUL.

01:00:06 WHAT IS THE NUMBER ONE MISTAKE PEOPLE MAKE IN ETF INVESTMENT?

01:00:10 GARGI: THE NUMBER ONE MISTAKE THAT

01:00:13 PEOPLE TALK ABOUT IS THE IDEA THAT ETF'S ARE RUINING YOUR

01:00:14 LIQUIDITY. WHAT WE FIND OUT OVER AND OVER

01:00:19 AGAIN IS THAT ACCESS TO ETF'S IS IN FACT ADDING LIQUIDITY TO

01:00:22 YOUR PORTFOLIO. THE NUMBER ONE MISTAKE THAT

01:00:25 PEOPLE OFTEN TALK ABOUT IS THIS ACTIVE VERSUS PASSIVE DEBATE.

01:00:29 THAT'S A LONG OVER. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WAYS IN

01:00:35 WHICH ACTIVE INVESTORS USING ETF'S IN THEIR PORTFOLIO.

01:00:38 WE LAUNCHED SOME INCREDIBLE ACTIVE ETF'S. TOM:

01:00:46 IT IS BOTTOM CORE. JONATHAN: CAN I ASK YOU A SHORT QUESTION?

01:00:53 IS CHAIRMAN POWELL GOING TO PUSH BACK LATER? GARGI:

01:00:56 I THINK HE IS. HE HAS TO PUSH BACK A LITTLE

01:00:59 BIT ON THE AMOUNT OF RATE CUTS THAT HAVE BEEN PLACED IN FOR

01:01:03 2024 AND HOW QUICKLY. I THINK THE MARCH CUT IS THE

01:01:06 ISSUE, NOT THE 110 BASIS POINTS OF CUTS. JONATHAN:

01:01:12 THE MARKET HAS HAD SELECTIVE HEARING. DO WE GET A RESPONSE?

01:01:15 GARGI: THEY HAVE TO BE MORE FORTHRIGHT

01:01:19 ABOUT THE LANGUAGE, AT LEAST STRONGER THAN WHAT HE USED IN

01:01:20 THE SPELLMAN-GODDARD SPEECH. IT IS TIME TO BRING BACK THE

01:01:26 NOT THINKING ABOUT/THINKING ABOUT. JONATHAN:

01:01:30 IF WE ARE AT THAT POINT NOT THINKING ABOUT THINKING ABOUT

01:01:31 RATE CUTS. TOM: I WANT TO TALK ABOUT EARNINGS

01:01:36 TALK. THE RESILIENT AMERICAN ECONOMY,

01:01:43 THE TECHNOLOGICAL EXCELLENCE. NOT ONLY IN TECHNOLOGY SHARES

01:01:44 BUT HEALTH CARE SHARES. THE TECHNOLOGY OVERLAY, THE

01:01:50 SUPPOSE IT AI REVOLUTION, BRING IT TO UNITEDHEALTH.

01:01:52 THOSE KINDS OF QUESTIONS. JONATHAN:

01:01:56 OFF THE BACK OF THE RATE CUT DEBATE, MOVE THE SOMETHING LIKE

01:02:00 10% ON THE S&P 500 SINCE THE LAST TIME THAT THE FED MET.

01:02:03 EQUITY FUTURES THIS MORNING ARE POSITIVE. 0.1%.

01:02:06 YOU HAD A FINAL THOUGHT THAT YOU COULD SHARE WITH US NOW.

01:02:08 ON THE FEDERAL RESERVE? T.K. JUMPED IN WHEN WE WERE ABOUT TO

01:02:12 TALK. TOM: THE FIRST TIME THAT HAS

01:02:14 HAPPENED. GARGI: I THINK THAT THEY PUSH BACK

01:02:19 GIVEN THE TRAJECTORY OF STRENGTH.

01:02:21 BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THEY'RE VERY COGNIZANT ABOUT NOT

01:02:27 PREPARING THE MARKETS FOR ANY MORE HIKES.

01:02:29 I THINK WE WILL HAVE THIS BALANCE WHERE THEY SAY THAT

01:02:33 THEY ARE GOING TO BE ON PAUSE FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

01:02:34 IT IS ALL RIGHT FOR THE MARKET TO STAY ON PAUSE.

01:02:39 WHAT I'M EXCITED ABOUT IN 2024 IS TO NOT HANG ON EVERY SINGLE

01:02:42 WORD THAT THE FED IS SAYING FOR THE FIRST HALF.

01:02:48 I THINK FOR THE FIRST FEW MONTHS I HOPE QUITE LIKELY.

01:02:51 LET'S WAIT AND WATCH THE HIGHER RATES DO ITS MAGIC. JONATHAN:

01:02:56 I THINK WE SHARE THE HOPE THAT WE CAN MOVE ON FROM A LOT OF

01:02:57 THIS. HAVE A WONDERFUL CHRISTMAS.

01:02:59 THANK YOU. EQUITIES ARE JUST ABOUT

01:03:03 POSITIVE BY ZERO POINT 1% ON THE S&P 500.

01:03:07 IF WE GET THE PUSHBACK IN THE NEWS CONFERENCE, WILL THE 2024

01:03:11 MEDIAN DOT COMPROMISE THEIR ABILITY TO PUSH BACK IF IT

01:03:14 SHOWS MORE CUTS FROM THE LAST TIME THAT THEY GAVE US

01:03:15 PROJECTIONS? TOM: GREAT QUESTION -- LISA:

01:03:19 GREAT QUESTION. HOW DO THEY UNDERSTAND THE

01:03:23 CONDITIONS FOR CUTTING RATES IF THEY DON'T RATCHET BACK THEIR

01:03:27 EXPECTATION FOR GROWTH AND RATCHET UP THEIR EXPECTATION

01:03:28 FOR UNEMPLOYMENT? TOM: THE GOOD JOBS MARKET HAS TO

01:03:31 CRACK. IT HASN'T CRACKED YET. JONATHAN: ON THE SURFACE.

01:03:37 BENEATH THE SURFACE, LITTLE CRACKS.

01:03:41 ANNE-MARIE IN WASHINGTON, D.C. ON CHAIR YELLEN AND VICE CHAIR

01:04:30 >> WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPLY UKRAINE WITH CRITICAL WEAPONS

01:04:32 AND EQUIPMENT AS LONG AS WE CAN, INCLUDING $200 MILLION

01:04:36 THAT I JUST APPROVED TODAY. WITHOUT SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING WE

01:04:40 ARE RAPIDLY COMING TO AN END TO OUR ABILITY TO HELP UKRAINE

01:04:43 RESPOND TO THE URGENT OPERATIONAL DEMAND IT HAS.

01:04:47 JONATHAN: PRESIDENT BIDEN SPEAKING

01:04:49 ALONGSIDE VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY AT THE WHITE HOUSE YESTERDAY AS

01:04:53 THE POLITICAL FIGHT OVER AID CONTINUES WITH SPEAKER JOHNSON.

01:04:54 GOOD MORNING. THE PRICE ACTION FOR YOU GOING

01:04:58 INTO THE FEDERAL RESERVE DECISION LATER THIS AFTERNOON,

01:05:01 TREADING WATER AS YOU MAY EXPECT.

01:05:04 FUTURES POSITIVE 5.1% ON THE S&P END YIELDS A TOUCH LOWER.

01:05:07 STILL SUB FOR 20. IN BETWEEN 4.1 AND 4.2.

01:05:13 4.1795 ON THE U.S. 10 YEAR THIS MORNING.

01:05:27 TOM: OF MOST SINGLE DATA POINTS, THE

01:05:28 FOUR KEY DATA POINTS, ON RADIO WE THROUGHOUT THE FOUR KEY DATA

01:05:29 POINTS ON TV, I AM STUNNED WITH A 4.1 810 YEAR, WHICH TELLS ME

01:05:30 THAT PEOPLE THINK THAT THIS IS

01:05:36 MASSIVELY BAKED IN THE CAKE, INFLATION JONATHAN: FRIENDLY.

01:05:38 WHICH IS WHY I WOULD SAVE YOU GET PUSHBACK FROM CHAIRMAN

01:05:39 POWELL HOW CREDIBLE IS THAT PUSHBACK GIVEN WHAT WE SEEN IN

01:05:41 THE ECONOMIC DATA? EVEN PRESIDENT BIDEN COMING OUT

01:05:46 ON FRIDAY. WE HAVE BEEN JOKING THAT IT IS

01:05:49 VICE CHAIR BIDEN OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE WITH HIS PREMEETING

01:05:53 MEETING. NOT ENCOURAGING THE FED TO

01:05:55 RAISE INTEREST RATES. IT TAKES A CERTAIN DEGREE OF

01:05:59 CONFIDENCE TO COME OUT AND SAY THOSE THINGS, EVEN IF IT'S ONE

01:06:01 PART ECONOMICS AND 10 PARTS POLITICS. TOM:

01:06:05 I'M PUTTING UP ON THE BLOOMBERG RIGHT NOW -- I HAVE THE<GO> KEY

01:06:10 TO DO THIS. JANUARY 31 MARCH 20, MAY 1.

01:06:15 DO WE ASSUME THAT IT IS LIKE A JULY ACTION BY THE FED?

01:06:18 I DON'T THINK THAT THEY HAVE THAT LUXURY.

01:06:23 ALL OF THOSE CHOICES, ALL OF THOSE MOMENTS.

01:06:25 THEY WILL GET THERE SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. LISA:

01:06:30 THE WAY THE FED CHAIR COULD PUSH BACK AND BE CREDIBLE AS IF

01:06:33 HE HIGHLIGHTS KEY REASONS FOR BEING BEARISH ON THE ECONOMY.

01:06:36 IF WE ARE SEEING REAL SIGNS OF SLOWDOWN THAT ARE PERHAPS

01:06:39 LEADING INDICATORS THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT FOCUSED ENOUGH.

01:06:41 THAT WOULD GET THE MARKETS ATTENTION AND PERHAPS NOT IN

01:06:42 THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE. JONATHAN: I THINK WE HAVE TO FRAME IT

01:06:46 LIKE THIS. THINK ABOUT HOW RIDICULOUS THIS

01:06:50 CONVERSATION SOUNDS 12 MONTHS AGO.

01:06:53 12 MONTH AGO INTO THE NEW YEAR AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WHERE

01:06:54 THE FED MIGHT BE. THREE MONTHS LATER IN SPRING WE

01:06:58 HAVE BANKS FAILING. PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE

01:07:02 CYCLE BEING OVER AND THE FED NEEDS TO START CUTTING INTEREST

01:07:03 RATES. SIX MONTHS AFTER THAT WE ARE IN

01:07:08 A THIRD QUARTER WITH 5% GDP GROWTH.

01:07:10 THIS YEAR DID NOT MATERIALIZE IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM IN

01:07:15 THE WAY MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT. PLUS, WHEN YOU STARTED GETTING

01:07:17 THE OUTCOMES THAT PEOPLE DID NOT PREDICT, YOU DID NOT GET

01:07:21 THAT THAT OUTCOME THE PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT WE WOULD SEE

01:07:22 EITHER. LET'S FRAME 2024 WITH A LITTLE

01:07:26 BIT OF HUMILITY AFTER THE RIDICULOUS 2023 WE JUST HAD.

01:07:29 TOM: THE QUESTION, THINK IT IS PANDEMIC-REDUCED?

01:07:35 ON A PANDEMIC SERVICE SECTOR BASIS FOR NOT.

01:07:41 THAT CACOPHONY OF 2023 WAS LIVING WITH THE DEBRIS OF THE

01:07:42 PANDEMIC. THAT IS NOT IN THE MANDATE OF

01:07:44 THE CENTRAL BANK. JONATHAN: THE SECOND HALF WE HAVE RATE

01:07:50 CUTS AT CITI. THE LONGER THAT GOES THROUGH

01:07:55 2024 YOU THINK ABOUT THE MATURITY IN LEASES WORLD IN

01:07:56 HIGH YIELD. A LOT OF COMPANIES NEED TO COME

01:07:59 TO MARKET AND RAISE SOME DEBT. THEY HOPE WE GET THOSE INTEREST

01:08:02 RATE CUTS SOON. WE WILL SEE IF WE DO. TOM:

01:08:06 IT WILL BE AN ISSUANCE FRENZY, RIGHT? LISA:

01:08:10 WHICH IS THE PROBLEM WITH BULLISH CREDIT CALLS AND WHY

01:08:14 EVERYONE IS HEDGING SAYING "HIGH-QUALITY." TOM: 1:30?

01:08:19 JONATHAN: SHOW STARTS AT 1:30. YOU CAN SHOW UP LATE IF YOU

01:08:21 WANT. TOM:

01:08:24 OUR BLOOMBERG WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT JOINS US THIS

01:08:35 MORNING.

01:08:36 I HAVE TO GO TO THIS MOMENT. I WILL GIVE YOU AN INFLAMMATORY

01:08:39 STATEMENT AND I WANT YOU TO AMEND IT BECAUSE IT IS AN

01:08:42 EMOTIONAL ZEITGEIST NOW. AMERICA WILL ALLOW VLADIMIR

01:08:45 PUTIN TO WIN. TAKE THAT INSIDE OF THE

01:08:47 BELTWAY, THAT A MOTION.

01:08:53 WHERE WILL WE BE -- INSIDE THE BELTWAY, THAT EMOTION.

01:08:55 WHERE WILL WE BE IN WEEKS AND MONTHS?

01:09:00 >> HE IS CLAIMING REPUBLICANS ARE HOLDING HOSTAGE THE UKRAINE

01:09:06 AID THAT WOULD HELP VLADIMIR PUTIN. THAT IS WHAT VOLODYMYR

01:09:07 ZELENSKYY SAID. THIS WILL HELP DICTATORS LIKE

01:09:11 PUTIN. THIS IS THE PUSH AND PULL THAT

01:09:15 WE HAVE AMONGST REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS GOING INTO THE

01:09:20 HOLIDAYS. THEIR SET TO LEAVE TOWN THIS

01:09:23 FRIDAY AND IT LOOKS LIKE THEY WON'T HAVE A DEAL.

01:09:26 LINDSEY GRAHAM COULD NOT BE MORE DIRECT ABOUT IT WHEN HE

01:09:29 SPOKE TO REPORTERS AFTER HE WAS BRIEFED BY PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY.

01:09:36 THIS IS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS A DEFENSE HAWK.

01:09:41 "I TOLD PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY MY NUMBER ONE OBLIGATION IS TO

01:09:44 SECURE MY COUNTRY AS WELL AS HELP YOURS.

01:09:47 PUBLICANS WANT A STRICT ORDER POLICY OR THERE WILL NOT BE

01:09:49 UKRAINE AID." LISA: HOW MUCH IS THAT MUDDYING HIS

01:09:54 DOMESTIC MESSAGE? WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW HE IS

01:09:59 VICE CHAIR TO JANET YELLEN'S CHAIR TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE.

01:10:04 PROGRESS LOWERING COSTS WITH INFLATION DOWN TWO THIRDS FROM

01:10:06 ITS PEAK BUT MANY STILL FIND TOO MANY THINGS UNAFFORDABLE.

01:10:09 HOW MUCH IS THIS A FRUSTRATION IN THE WHITE HOUSE?

01:10:13 THE LACK OF BREAKING THROUGH ON THE MESSAGE OF WHERE THE

01:10:16 ECONOMY IS RIGHT NOW? ANNMARIE: A MASSIVE FRUSTRATION.

01:10:19 THEY ARE LOOKING AT AN INCREDIBLE LABOR MARKET, UNDER

01:10:24 4% UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FOR 22 MONTHS NOW.

01:10:30 WHAT YOU HAVE IS POLL AFTER POLL SHOWING ESPECIALLY SWING

01:10:36 STATE VOTERS PREFERED DONALD TRUMP OVER PRESIDENT BIDEN'S

01:10:39 POLICIES..

01:10:45 IF YOU LOOK AT THE POL LSTER, IT IS ALMOST 2:1 IN SWING

01:10:57 STATES THEY DON'T LIKE BIDEN OMICS.THIS IS WHY HE ALWAYS

01:11:02 PIVOTS THAT HE UNDERSTANDS AMERICAN FAMILIES ARE STILL

01:11:06 STRUGGLING. THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE

01:11:08 EVERYTHING WHEN IT COMES TO ECONOMIC DATA NOW COLORED BY

01:11:10 THE FACT THAT WHEN IT COMES TO PRE-PANDEMIC TO NOW, A

01:11:16 HOUSEHOLD IS SPENDING 600 TO $700 MORE ON BASIC GOODS.

01:11:21 BUT THE LATEST INFLATION REPORT, WE ARE SEEING THINGS

01:11:28 HAVE REALLY DOGGED THIS ADMINISTRATION, LIKE GASOLINE,

01:11:29 ARE COMING DOWN HANDSOMELY.

01:11:36 YOU HAVE GAS PRICES JUST ABOVE $3 A GALLON.

01:11:38 THE TIMELINE PROVIDE AND POTENTIALLY GOING INTO NOVEMBER

01:11:39 COULD BE ON HIS SIDE. JONATHAN: THANK YOU ON THE LATEST. MORE

01:11:44 TO COME THROUGH THIS MORNING. DISTRACTED BY AN EMAIL.TIPPING

01:11:48 SEASON . 15% OF U.S.

01:11:55 ADULTS INCREASE HOW MUCH THEY TIP THIS HOLIDAY SEASON

01:11:56 COMPARED TO LAST YEAR ACCORDING TO BANKRATE.

01:12:01 44% PLAN TO TIP THE SAME AMOUNT. 13% SAY THEY ARE DECREASING

01:12:03 HOLIDAY TIPS THIS YEAR. 23% DID NOT TIP LAST HOLIDAY

01:12:09 SEASON AND DO NOT PLAN TO THIS YEAR EITHER. TOM:

01:12:14 I WAS STANDING OUTSIDE OF A CAB AND A GUY WAS GETTING OUT OF

01:12:15 THE CAR. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FARE WAS

01:12:20 BUT I NOTICED HE DID NOT TIP THE CABDRIVER. JONATHAN:

01:12:23 I DON'T LIKE THAT AT ALL. TOM: THERE ARE PLACES WHERE IT IS

01:12:29 PAINFULLY OBVIOUS TIPS IS HOW PEOPLE SURVIVE.

01:12:32 I'VE BEEN IN THAT POSITION SIX LIFETIMES AGO.

01:12:37 TO ME, THIS IS CULTURAL IN NEW YORK CITY. LISA:

01:12:42 I THINK THAT PEOPLE ACT WITH MORE IMPUNITY NOW BECAUSE THERE

01:12:45 IS A SUGGESTED TIP FOR EVERYTHING, EVEN WHEN YOU BUY

01:12:49 GROCERIES. THEY FLIP AROUND THE IPAD AND

01:12:51 IT IS A SUGGESTED TIP, WHICH HAS CREATED ANGER.

01:12:55 THAT SAID, PEOPLE DO LIVE OFF

01:13:01 OF TIPS AND IF YOU ARE NOT TIPPING -- TOM:

01:13:05 UNLOAD THE DISHWASHER AND SHE IS LOOKING FOR A SUGGESTED TIP.

01:13:09 JONATHAN: 25%. DOORMAN TIP IS WHERE PEOPLE GET

01:13:14 CONFUSED AND THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH TO TIP THE

01:13:15 DOORMAN. WHAT IS THE RIGHT AMOUNT?

01:13:22 I SAY 30% OF YOUR MONTHLY RENT DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE STAFF.

01:13:29 FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN THERE LONGER, USUALLY YOU GET A

01:13:31 DECENT AMOUNT COMPARED TO THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN HERE 12

01:13:34 MONTHS OR SO. THAT IS MY APPROACH. TOM:

01:13:38 THE ANSWER IS TO LIVE IN A WALK UP LIKE ME WHERE THERE IS NO

01:13:40 DOORMAN TO TIP. JONATHAN: EQUITY FUTURES ON THE S&P FROM

01:14:02 JONATHAN: JUST GOT AN FROM JONATHAN.

01:14:09 TIPPING NOW IS FOR 2023, IT'S FOR 2024.

01:14:16 TOM: IT GOT A HUGE RESPONSE. PEOPLE ARE FIRED UP ABOUT THIS.

01:14:26 JONATHAN: EVERYONE WANTS TO MAKE SURE

01:14:29 THEY ARE GENEROUS BUT THEY'RE NOT SURE WHAT GENEROUS IS IN

01:14:30 NEW YORK. TOM:

01:14:36 I GET UPSET AT THE ZERO'S. YOU DON'T KNOW JONATHAN: WHAT

01:14:37 TO DO. JONATHAN:YOU PAY AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.

01:14:45 TOM: I HAVE BEEN AT JOBS WHERE ALL

01:14:47 THE MONEY I EARNED FROM TIPS WAS LINED UP ON THE DRESSER.

01:14:51 A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT FEELING.

01:14:55 TO ME, THAT IS IMPORTANT. JONATHAN:

01:15:05 THE PRICE ACTION, S&P IS POSITIVE BY .11%.

01:15:10 THE TWO YEAR, 10 YEAR, TWO YEAR HAS BEEN AROUND 5% AND DOWN TO

01:15:14 FOUR POINT 71. THE 10-YEAR IS DOWN AT 4.18.

01:15:20 SINCE THE FED LAST MEANT WE HAVE HOW TO MOVE DOWN 10

01:15:25 PERCENTAGE POINTS. THE 10 YEAR IS SOMETHING LIKE

01:15:29 70 BASIS POINTS. LISA: FOR ALL THE RIGHT REASONS.

01:15:36 THIS IS SOMETHING WE HAVE TO KEEP HARPING ON.

01:15:44 IT'S THE ACCEPT ANCE OF THE FACT.

01:15:47 ERNST & YOUNG IS LAYING OFF A NUMBER OF PEOPLE.

01:15:54 PEOPLE ARE NOT QUITTING BECAUSE THERE ISN'T THE KIND OF ROBUST

01:15:56 JOB MARKET THAT THERE USED TO BE. JONATHAN:

01:16:01 LOOK AT HASBRO, TWO WEEKS BEFORE CHRISTMAS.

01:16:04 CUTTING 20% OF THE STAFF.

01:16:11 THE FX MARKET WITH THE EURO AGAINST THE DOLLAR, IT LOOKS

01:16:15 LIKE THIS, THE EURO OUT 1.07. A CLASSIC FED DAY PERFORMANCE.

01:16:22 TOM: WHAT WE SEE TOMORROW, DO WE SEE

01:16:26 FIREWORKS? JONATHAN:

01:16:34 THEY'RE GOING TO GO FIRST. THE PUSHBACK FROM LAGARDE.

01:16:39 SHE HAD THE LUXURY OF GOING THE DAY AFTER THE FEDERAL RESERVE.

01:16:47 IT JUST GIVES YOU A LITTLE MORE LUXURY TO GET THAT MESSAGE

01:16:49 ACROSS. TOM:

01:16:56 AT THE ECB MEETING YOU SAY, HOW ABOUT THAT TAX? JONATHAN:

01:17:01 YOU ONLY GET TO FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS AT THE ECB.

01:17:02 IT'S A LITTLE MORE CIVIL.

01:17:08 LET'S GET TO THE TOP STORY, THE FED IS EXPECTED TO HOLD GREAT

01:17:11 STUDY.

01:17:18 THE FOCUS WILL BE ON CHAIRMAN POWELLS NEWS CONFERENCE AS

01:17:19 INVESTORS TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHEN THE FED WILL START CUTTING.

01:17:25 THE PROJECTION SHOWING TO RATE BECAUSE NEXT YEAR.

01:17:32 THAT SEEMS TO BE THE CONSENSUS, ANYWHERE BETWEEN 2, 3 CUTS.

01:17:36 LISA: DOES IT MATTER? AT THIS POINT I'M MORE

01:17:39 INTERESTED IN THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AND GROWTH FIGURES THAN

01:17:42 THE DOT PLOT. THE WHY OF IT WILL TAKE ON MORE

01:17:50 IMPORTANCE WHERE FINANCIAL CONDITIONS HAVE BECOME MORE

01:17:52 ACCOMMODATIVE THAN THE FIRST RATE LAST YEAR.

01:17:57 IF THAT IS THE CASE AND THEY DON'T PUSH BACK WHERE THEY SAY

01:18:00 IT'S BECAUSE THE ECONOMY IS GOING TO BE WEAKENING.

01:18:01 THAT WILL HAVE A BIGGER IMPACT ON THE MARKET IN THE DOT PLOT.

01:18:04 JONATHAN: PRESIDENT BIDEN GIVING HIS

01:18:10 SHARPEST REVIEW OF BENJAMIN NETANYAHU IN THE FIGHT AGAINST

01:18:16 HAMAS CALLING THE BOMBING AND DISCRIMINATE IN THE COURSE OF

01:18:22 THE WAR MUST CHANGE OR ISRAEL RISKS LOSING GLOBAL SUPPORT.

01:18:25 UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT TRYING TO SECURE A DEAL DESPITE MEETING

01:18:30 WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN AND MIKE JOHNSON.

01:18:36 ISRAEL, WE KNEW THERE WAS DIVISION BEHIND THE SCENES.

01:18:40 WE KNEW THE ADMINISTRATION WAS LOBBYING NETANYAHU PRIVATELY.

01:18:49 INDIRECTLY FROM KAMALA HARRIS AND NOW THE PRESIDENT. TOM:

01:18:54 AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR I HAVE NO IDEA HOW THIS WILL WORK

01:18:58 IN THE APPARATUS OF ALL THE ALLIES AND HOW THIS WILL WORK.

01:19:02 JONATHAN: TELL ME WHERE THE POLLS ARE IN

01:19:05 A MONTH AND I'LL TELL YOU WHERE WE ARE.

01:19:09 THE POLLS ARE GOING AGAINST THE PRESIDENT IN A MAJOR WAY. LISA:

01:19:15 WHICH EXPLAINS THE HARSHER RHETORIC.

01:19:18 HE HAS TRIED TO PUSH IN THAT DIRECTION. JONATHAN:

01:19:25 THE ECONOMY NOT TOO BAD BUT IN ARGENTINA, A DIFFERENT STORY.

01:19:29 THE PRESIDENT BEGINS HIS DRASTIC PLAN TO OVERHAUL THE

01:19:32 ECONOMY.

01:19:41 WITH THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF MASSIVE SPENDING CUTS.

01:19:47 ADOPTING THE DOLLAR AS THE CURRENCY. TOM:

01:19:53 BLOOMBERG HAS DONE GREAT WORK ON THIS.

01:19:59 YOU PARSE THE ARGENTINIAN PESO WHICH IS BEING PRICED FROM 3.66

01:20:04 TO 800.

01:20:11 YOU LOOK AT THE BLUE BLUE DOLLAR WHICH IS THE

01:20:16 BLACK MARKET ARGENTINIAN PESO.

01:20:23 THE DEVALUATION, 64% OF THE BLACK MARKET PESO.

01:20:29 LISA: THEY MADE SOME REAL CUTS. POLITICAL AND BUDGETARY CUTS.

01:20:40 THE QUESTION IS,

01:21:05 HE IS NOT HE IS NOT GOING AS FAR AS THE

01:21:06 PEOPLE EXPECTED AND RADICAL CANDIDATES HAVE BECOME

01:21:10 TRADITIONAL AND THE PEOPLE THAT

01:21:19 JONATHAN: ARE THERE ECONOMIC EXPERIMENTS

01:21:22 TAKING PLACE? TOM:

01:21:34 I CAN'T GET USED TO THE BANNER, MICHAEL SCHUMACHER JOINS US NOW.

01:21:42 WE ARE ON THE DOWN ESCALATOR OR A DOWN ELEVATOR.

01:21:44 WHAT DOES 24 LOOK LIKE?

01:21:50 AM I ON THE ESCALATOR OR THE ELEVATOR?

01:21:56 >> YOU ARE ON THE ESCALATOR, A SLOW MOVE DOWN IN YIELDS.

01:21:59 I THINK IT'S INTERESTING TO HEAR THE MOVE DOWN IN TERMS OF

01:22:03 EQUITIES AND BONDS THAT WE THINK THE MARKET IS A LITTLE

01:22:05 OVERDONE.

01:22:11 WE LIKE THE DIRECTION, WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE BUT THE SLOW

01:22:13 PATH IS OUR PREFERRED ROUTE. TOM:

01:22:17 HOW DO YOU FOLD THESE ECONOMICS INTO YOUR STUDY?

01:22:20 IS IT A STUDY OF GLOBAL WEAKNESS?

01:22:27 OR CAN THERE BE A SURPRISE RESILIENCY?

01:22:33 MIKE: THERE IS A POTENTIAL FOR A SURPRISE.

01:22:37 CHINA IS A GOOD EXAMPLE EXPECTATIONS ARE SO LONG SO

01:22:42 IT’'S NOT DIFFICULT TO SURPRISE TO THE UPSIDE.

01:22:47 THE GOAL BACKDROP IS NOT THAT GREAT.

01:22:50 EUROPE, CANADA LOOKS LIKE IT WOULD BE GOING INTO RECESSION.

01:22:53 U.S. PROBABLY LAGGING BEHIND. IT'S NOT A PRETTY PICTURE BUT

01:22:59 THAT IS WHAT YOU WANT FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT. LISA:

01:23:04 YOU SAID THE MOVE IS OVERDONE AND I'M CURIOUS WHICH MAY IN

01:23:05 PARTICULAR. THE FACT THAT WE WON'T GET AS

01:23:11 MANY RATE BECAUSE FOR THE FACT THAT WE WILL HAVE A STRONG

01:23:15 ECONOMY THAT PERSISTS WHERE WE ARE IN THIS ECONOMIC CYCLE OR

01:23:19 THAT THIS INFLATION COULD CONTINUE WITH THE PACE WE HAVE

01:23:24 SEEN? MIKE:

01:23:25 I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE YIELD MOVE UP AND THEN DOWN.

01:23:28 WE THINK THE VOLATILITY AND BOND HAS BEEN EXTRAORDINARY.

01:23:32 THINKING ABOUT OTHER THINGS THAT ARE OVERCOOKED AS WELL.

01:23:36 MARKET EXPECTATIONS FOR EASY, PICK YOUR FAVORITE CENTRAL BANK.

01:23:42 THEY SEEM PRETTY AGGRESSIVE TO US RIGHT NOW FOR NEXT YEAR

01:23:46 THAT'S NOT TO SAY THE CENTRAL BANKS WON'T GET THERE BUT THE

01:23:49 MARKETS ARE AHEAD OF THE POLICYMAKERS.

01:23:57 THE FED IS PRICE TO EASE FOR, FIVE BASIS POINT BY NEXT YEARS

01:24:01 BUT WE THINK THE MARKET IS RUNNING TOO FAR AHEAD OF JAY

01:24:02 POWELL IN THE TEAM RIGHT NOW. LISA:

01:24:07 DO YOU THINK THAT THE ECONOMY WILL REMAIN STRONG FOR THAT

01:24:14 DISINFLATION WILL COME DOWN ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY RATE CUTS

01:24:19 WILL NOT COME THROUGH? MIKE: WHAT'S GOING ON A RISK

01:24:25 MARKETS, THEY ARE REACTING TO WHAT THEY INC.

01:24:26 CENTRAL BANKERS WILL DO. AS IT BECOMES LESS LIKELY THAT

01:24:33 THEY WILL HIKE, MORE LIKELY THEY WILL CUT PRETTY SOON AND

01:24:38 RISK MARKETS LIKE THAT.

01:24:45 IT'S BEEN ABOUT THAT SIMPLE .

01:24:51 TOM: PART OF THIS IS WHAT THE DOLLAR

01:24:54 WILL DO IN ALL OF THIS COMES BACK TO THE ASSUMPTION OF A

01:24:57 WEAKER DOLLAR. IS THAT YOUR CALL? MIKE:

01:25:05 THE DOLLAR PROBABLY WE CAN SOMEWHAT THAT THERE IS A

01:25:08 CONSENSUS AND WE DISAGREE.

01:25:14 THE BASIC THESIS IS THAT THE FED HAS HIKED A LOT AND THEY

01:25:17 HAVE THE HIGHEST POLICY RATE SO THEY WILL SEE THE MOST DOLLAR

01:25:18 WEAKNESS. BUT IT'S ALL DRIVEN BY THE IDEA

01:25:25 THAT THE FED GOES FIRST. WHY SHOULD THE FED GO FIRST?

01:25:28 WHY NOT THE ECB OR CANADA?

01:25:36 WE SEE A BIT OF WEAKNESS BUT MASSIVE WEAKNESS, NO. JONATHAN:

01:25:42 JUST PRICED IN MASSIVE RATE CUTS WITH THE BANK OF ENGLAND,

01:25:43 WHO DO YOU THINK GOES FIRST? MIKE:

01:25:48 LET'S SAY THE CANDIDATE IS ARE FED, BANK OF CANADA, BOE, I

01:25:55 WILL PUT THE ECB FIRST, BANK OF CANADA SECOND, BOE IS A STRANGE

01:26:00 ONE TO HANDICAP. JONATHAN: IS NOT A COLLAR DISINFLATION

01:26:04 CALLED? MIKE: IT'S AN INFLATION COMFORT CALL.

01:26:08 HOW CERTAIN ARE YOU AS A POLICYMAKER THAT INFLATION IS

01:26:13 NOT JUST DOWN BUT OUT? THAT WILL DICTATE THE POT.

01:26:18 JONATHAN: THANK YOU MIKE, YOU'RE ONE OF

01:26:23 THE BEST. HAPPY CHRISTMAS. MIKE SHOEMAKER OF WELLS FARGO.

01:26:27 LOOKING FOR THE ECB TO GO FIRST. HOW MANY TIMES WE HEARD

01:26:29 THAT? LISA: IT'S CONSENSUS. IT RAISES THE QUESTION OF HOW

01:26:35 MANY PEOPLE WILL GET ON BOARD? JONATHAN:

01:26:43 FROM THE 1.07, 1.08 THAT IS NOT CURRENTLY.

01:26:48 IF YOU JUST WAKING UP WITH US YOUR MARKET IS UP.

01:26:54 WE HAVE THE PERFECT GUESTS TO TALK ABOUT THE SAHM RULE.

01:27:00 EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT THIS. TOM:

01:27:08 IT'S LIKE STEPHANIE KELTON WAS, AND ORIGINAL ECONOMISTS.

01:27:15 TO HER IMMENSE CREDIT, SHE PUSHED AGAINST THE CERTITUDE OF

01:27:17 IT.

01:27:29 SHE SHOULD BE ON THE TONIGHT SHOW TALKING ABOUT THESE THINGS.

01:27:33 JONATHAN: THE LABOR MARKET REPORT CHANGE

01:27:34 THINGS A LITTLE BIT. UNEMPLOYMENT COMING IN A LITTLE

01:27:36 LOWER. LISA: SHE CAME UP WITH THE IDEA THAT

01:27:44 IF YOU SEE A HALF PERCENTAGE POINT IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF

01:27:47 CASES, RECESSION. NOW YOU HAVE TO WONDER, ARE WE

01:27:55 IN A DIFFERENT PERIOD OF TIME. SHE HERSELF IS SAID IT'S NOT

01:28:00 REALLY A RULE IS JUST A HISTORICAL CORRELATION.

01:28:04 THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS PEOPLE ARE SAYING WE COULD BE

01:28:10 GOING INTO A TOUGHER PERIOD. COMING UP NEXT, SOMEONE WHO HAS

01:28:50 >> TO THIS POINT ABOUT WHETHER THE FED CUTS ARE NOT MARKED,

01:28:52 IT'S NOT REALISTIC. IN THE LAST 18 MONTHS THE

01:28:57 MARKET HAS BEEN OVERLY OPTIMISTIC ON WHEN THE FED IS

01:28:58 CUTTING. IF OUR CALL IS RIGHT, WERE MORE

01:29:04 LIKELY TO HAVE A SOFT LANDING THAN A RECESSION.

01:29:08 NOT CUTTING IN MARCH 2024. JONATHAN:

01:29:12 FROM NEW YORK, COUNTING THEM DOWN TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE

01:29:18 DECISION. ON THE S&P POSITIVE BY 0.1%.

01:29:23 YIELDS COMING IN AT FOUR POINT 17.

01:29:29 THE FX MARKET UNCHANGED, THE EURO AT 1.07.

01:29:32 AN INTERESTING 24 HOURS FOR FOREIGN POLICY.

01:29:38 THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES LABELING THE BOMBING

01:29:40 DONE BY ISRAELIS INDISCRIMINATE AND THEY RISK LOSING GLOBAL

01:29:42 SUPPORT.

01:29:48 ISRAEL IS CALLING FOR A CEASE-FIRE IS A GIFT TO HAMAS.

01:29:52 THE MINISTER OF ISRAEL SAYING THEY WILL CONTINUE THE WAR WITH

01:29:54 OR WITHOUT GLOBAL SUPPORT. THAT'S THE INDIRECT PUSHBACK.

01:29:59 LISA: THE CONSENSUS ABOUT CONTINUING

01:30:02 THIS IS PRETTY CONCRETE BECAUSE IT'S AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO

01:30:09 THE NATION.

01:30:10 THERE IS A QUESTION ABOUT THE DIVERGENCE ABOUT THE ELECTION

01:30:11 CYCLE IN THE REALITY ON THE GROUND.

01:30:17 JONATHAN: THAT'S THE LATEST. TOM: THIS

01:30:23 DOVETAILS INTO A THREE HOUR CONVERSATION WITH SOMEONE WHO

01:30:25 DESERVES A FOUR HOUR CONVERSATION.

01:30:34 JACOB FRENKEL WAS BORN IN MANDATORY PALESTINE.

01:30:46 HIS LEADERSHIP FOR HIS ISRAEL IS FORMER BANK OF ISRAEL

01:30:51 GOVERNOR JACOB FRENKEL. I HAVE TO ASK YOU, YOUR

01:30:59 PERSPECTIVE ON ISRAEL, THEIR ECONOMY, THEIR DOMESTIC PLACE

01:31:04 AFTER THESE HOSTILITIES? HOW WILL ISRAEL COME OUT OF

01:31:06 THESE FACILITIES? JACOB:

01:31:09 I AM VERY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT ISRAEL BUT WE ARE IN THE MIDST

01:31:20 OF A CRISIS, A WAR.

01:31:25 AFTER AN EXTRAORDINARY ATTACK ON ISRAEL AND ISRAELIS HAVE TO

01:31:27 DEFEND THEMSELVES. THE COST IS VERY HIGH IN TERMS

01:31:35 OF CASUALTIES, RESOURCES AND IN TERMS OF POLITICAL SUPPORT.

01:31:40 IT IS GOING TO BE OVER AND ONCE IT IS OVER THE RECORD OF ISRAEL

01:31:47 OF REJUVENATING AFTER WARS IS VERY CLEAR.

01:31:53 WE ARE PICKING IT UP QUICKLY AND ONCE ALL THE RESERVIST ARE

01:31:59 RELEASED AND COMING BACK TO BUSINESS, ISRAEL WILL KNOW HOW

01:32:01 TO REEMERGE. THE TECHNOLOGY IS STILL THERE,

01:32:06 THE COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE, EXPERTISE ARE ALL STILL THERE.

01:32:12 THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO CROSS THIS CRISIS. TOM:

01:32:17 AS A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE U.S.

01:32:18 CHANGED? JACOB: THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP IS

01:32:22 KEY TO ISRAEL.

01:32:28 AND ISRAEL, WITH THE ONLY DEMOCRACY IN THE REGION AND

01:32:30 SHARING VALUES WITH THE UNITED STATES.

01:32:33 WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL TO THOSE SUPPORT GIVEN BY THE UNITED

01:32:39 STATES. OF COURSE, THE UNITED STATES

01:32:42 HAS ITS OWN POLITICAL CYCLE.

01:32:48 BUT ISRAEL IS FINDINGS -- FIGHTING FOR ITS EXISTENCE AND

01:32:51 IT WILL NEED TO COMPLETE THE JOB WITH THE MOST PROFESSIONAL

01:32:54 AND CAREFUL WAY. WE ARE NOT DEALING WITH THE

01:32:58 NORMAL ARMY. IT IS TERRORISM.

01:33:02 AGAINST TERRORISM, IT'S DIFFICULT TO HAVE A POLITE WAY

01:33:10 TO DEAL WITH IT.

01:33:13 LISA: I WANT TO SEGUE INTO YOUR EXPERIENCE AS THE FORMER HEAD

01:33:20 OF THIS IS REALLY CENTRAL BANK AND AT THE CROSSROADS OF

01:33:24 UNDERSTANDING HOW TO OPERATE ECONOMIC POLICY WHEN DEALING

01:33:29 WITH FISCAL POLICY THAT IS INCONSISTENT AND LACKING IN

01:33:31 CERTAIN AREAS. YOU WROTE IN YOUR PIECE,

01:33:34 CENTRAL BANKS CANNOT SOLVE ALL

01:33:40 OF OUR SA AILS. DO YOU THINK THERE IS SOME

01:33:44 LEADERSHIP TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THE HELM AWAY FROM CENTRAL

01:33:49 BANKERS? JACOB: THE IMPORTANT POINT IS THAT

01:33:52 LEADERSHIP IS RISING TO THE CHALLENGE AND IF CENTRAL BANKS

01:33:58 ARE STEPPING INTO EACH CRISIS IT BECOMES OVERWHELMING.

01:34:03 ONCE IT BECOMES OVERBURDENED BECOMES LESS CLEAR, TRANSPARENT.

01:34:08 WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST FEW YEARS IS THAT WERE

01:34:11 OPERATING IN A COMPLEX ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.

01:34:20 WE HAD FIGHT INFLATION WITH INTEREST RATES.

01:34:29 THE FRAGILITY AND SPEED OF TRANSMISSION, EXPECTATIONS,

01:34:34 MAKES IT MUCH MORE COMPLEX AND THEREFORE, WE SHOULD BE CAREFUL

01:34:37 NOT TO ASSUME THAT THE CENTRAL BANK KNOWS MORE THAN WHAT IT

01:34:39 DOES NO. IT SHOULD SPECIALIZE IN THE

01:34:47 AREAS THAT IT HAS A COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE AND TOOLS THAT ARE

01:34:48 PROTECTED BY THE LAW.

01:34:54 THE COMPETENCE IS ABOUT ACHIEVING PRICE STABILITY AND

01:35:02 SECURING THE FUNDAMENTAL OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS.

01:35:05 I ENLARGE, THIS IS THE MENDE.

01:35:15 WE HAVE SEEN A REAL CRISIS THAT IF CENTRAL BANKERS WERE GOOD

01:35:21 CITIZENS AND ROSE TO THE CHALLENGE.

01:35:27 WHEN THEY GO INTO REGIONS THAT ARE NOT EXACTLY THEIR

01:35:30 COMPETENCE, WE CALL FOR A CALL BACK TO BASICS. LISA:

01:35:35 IT'S INTERESTING THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT RATE CUTS IN

01:35:38 MARCH EVEN THOUGH WE’'RE SEEING THIS RATE IN THE UNITED STATES.

01:35:45 THERE WAS THE SIMPLE MANDATE, IS THERE A POLITICAL OVERLAY

01:35:47 AND PROTECTING SOMETHING ELSE BY CUTTING RATES AT A TIME WHEN

01:35:52 INFLATION IS STILL WELL ABOVE THE TARGET? JACOB:

01:35:57 THERE ARE TWO THINGS HE MENTIONED, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

01:36:03 NOT CURRENT INFLATION BUT EXPECTED INFLATION IN THE

01:36:08 MEDIUM TERM.

01:36:09 WHAT YOU DO NOW WILL HAVE AN IMPACT OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL

01:36:14 QUARTERS.

01:36:15 NUMBER TWO, WE SHOULD NOT SPEAK JUST ABOUT RATE CUTS ARE RATE

01:36:16 HIKES. THAT IS THE WAY WE ARE ALL

01:36:21 FOCUSING ON EVERY DAY. WILL IT BE AT 2:00, 3:00?

01:36:30 ARE WE ON THE TRAJECTORY TO STABILITY IN THE CENTRAL BANK

01:36:34 CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THIS OBJECTIVE BY SECURING PRICE

01:36:36 STABILITY IN THE MEDIAN TERM. THE POLITICAL SUPPORT COMES

01:36:41 FROM THE CREDIBILITY OF THE CENTRAL BANK HAS EARNED AND

01:36:48 WILL HAVE TO EARN IN ORDER TO SECURE ITS ACTIONS.

01:36:54 NEEDS TO BE CLEAR, TRANSPARENT, ACCOUNTABLE AND IT NEEDS TO

01:37:00 CHARTER THE WAY.

01:37:02 WE WILL DEAL WITH THE BUDGET DEFICIT, THE CENTRAL BANK

01:37:04 SHOULD NOT DEAL WITH IT. JONATHAN:

01:37:09 IS THIS THE END OF THE ACTIVIST CENTRAL BANK? JACOB:

01:37:14 ACTIVISM MEANS GET OUT OF THE LANE YOU ARE DRIVING OR MAKE

01:37:18 SURE THAT YOU ARE DRIVING CAREFULLY WITHIN THE LANE AND

01:37:21 BEING ABLE TO NAVIGATE WITHIN THAT LANE.

01:37:24 ACTIVISM DOES NOT MEAN A DETOUR. IT MEANS, KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN

01:37:33 AND YOUR STEERING WHEEL IS ONLY GO TO THE RIGHT.

01:37:37 THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE STICKING BY YOUR

01:37:43 GUNS. IF YOU DO, THE MEDIAN TERM WILL

01:37:46 BE SIMPLER AND BETTER THAN CENTRAL BANKS WILL NOT BEHAVE

01:37:49 LIKE I WILL TAKE THE GOVERNMENTS OFF THE HOOK.

01:37:53 THE GOVERNMENTS HAVE THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES IN CENTRAL

01:37:57 BANKS OF THEIRS. JONATHAN:

01:37:59 A FANTASTIC REVIEW OF THE CENTRAL BANK OVER THE PAST

01:38:03 COUPLE OF DECADES. TOM:

01:38:05 COULD YOU SEE JACOB FRENKEL TALKING ABOUT THE DOT PLOT?

01:38:09 JONATHAN: WOULD YOU GET RID OF THE DOT

01:38:15 PLOT? JACOB: I'M NOT SURE. TOM: OH PLEASE.

01:38:21 [LAUGH] JACOB: WHAT DO YOU DO WITH IT?

01:38:29 LISA: WHAT YOU DO WITH THAT? JACOB: IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE

01:38:36 CENTRAL BANK DOES COMMUNICATE WITH MARKETS.

01:39:13 >> HE HAS A SUFFICIENT ARSENAL TO BRING INFLATION DOWN.

01:39:18 IT WILL GIVE THE FED THE ABILITY TO GO ON PAUSE.

01:39:22 THE FED WILL PROBABLY SIGNAL THAT IS DONE BUT DON'T EXPECT

01:39:23 RECOAT SOON. I DON'T THINK THAT THE RISK IS

01:39:28 THAT THE FED DOESN'T TIGHTEN TOO MUCH BUT RATHER NOT ENOUGH.

01:39:36 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE WITH TOM KEENE,

01:39:37 JONATHAN FERRO AND LISA ABRAMOWICZ. TOM:

01:39:44 GOOD MORNING EVERYONE, TODAY ON THIS FED DAY.

01:39:47 MAKE IT 1:30 THIS AFTERNOON.

01:39:54 A LOT GOING ON IN A SUPERCHARGED STOCK MARKET.

01:39:58 WE GO INTO THIS NEXT HOUR, GETTING READY FOR THIS MEETING

01:40:00 AND NOBODY HAS A CLUE. JONATHAN: LET'S MAKE IT REALLY SIMPLE,

01:40:07 THIS MARKET HAS DONE A TON OF WORK.

01:40:14 A 10% MOVE ON THE S&P 500 SINCE EARLY NOVEMBER.

01:40:17 THE 10 YEAR IS DOWN 70 BASIS POINTS.

01:40:22 THERE IS ONLY ONE QUESTION, SINCE CHAIRMAN POWELL PUSH

01:40:23 AGAINST THAT IN TODAY'S NEWS CONFERENCE?

01:40:27 DOES EASING FINANCIAL CONDITIONS BOTHER HIM? TOM:

01:40:34 THIS STATISTIC DOESN'T MATTER, ZERO .63 BUT THE ANSWER IS WE

01:40:37 GO INTO THE PRESS CONFERENCE SCREAMING ACCOMMODATIVE.

01:40:42 WE WALKED AWAY FROM THE HOPE OF A RESTRICTIVE POLICY. JONATHAN:

01:40:46 THIS MARKET IS SCREAMING RATE CUTS.

01:40:50 HOW MUCH WILL THERE BE BETWEEN THE MEDIAN DOT PLOT.

01:40:57 MOST PEOPLE ASSUME THAT THE FED IS COMING TOWARDS THIS MARKET.

01:41:03 TOM: WHAT AN HONOR TO HAVE JACOB FRENKEL WITH US.

01:41:07 THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF THE BANK OF ISRAEL.

01:41:12 YOU WERE BUSTING HIS CHOPS AND HE SAID WE SHOULD CONNECT THE

01:41:13 DOTS. LISA:

01:41:14 THIS WILL BE THE NUANCES OF HOW YOU PARSE ALL THE POTENTIAL

01:41:25 WORDS.

01:41:26 WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HOW ACCOMMODATIVE THIS MARKET IS

01:41:29 AND WE ARE STILL LOOKING AT AVERAGE YIELDS THAT ARE ABOVE A

01:41:31 PERCENT. INVESTMENT GRADE BOND YIELDS

01:41:36 THAT A RELATIVELY HIGH. WHEN WE STOP WITH ALL OF THE

01:41:41 DOGS, HOW DO WE LOOK AT THE SCENARIO AND SAY ARE WE HEADING

01:41:48 INTO A PERIOD OF GROWTH AND OUR WE ACCURATELY PRICING ALL THE

01:41:56 ASPECTS OF THE MARKET THAT ARE ACCOMMODATIVE? TOM:

01:41:59 IT IS ABOUT THE JOB ECONOMY. IN WEST TODAY, WEDNESDAY?

01:42:09 TOMORROW IS CLAIMS IN CONTINUING CLAIMS. IT HAS NOT

01:42:13 CRACKED. LISA:

01:42:19 ISN'T IT FUN TO ANALYZE EVERY NUANCE OF THE MARKET MOVING IN

01:42:20 A WAY WE DON'T UNDERSTAND.

01:42:26 WE ARE IN A MOMENT OF TRANSITION AND WE DON'T KNOW

01:42:27 WHERE WERE TRANSITIONING TO. TOM:

01:42:33 I LOOK FORWARD TO THE FED MEETING AND THERE WILL BE SOME

01:42:37 BLISTERING QUESTIONS HERE IN NUANCE AND THEN WE GO ON TO THE

01:42:41 ECB AND THEY'RE ALL FACING THE SAME THING.

01:42:43 THIS IS ALL ORIGINAL TERRITORY FOR CENTRAL BANKS. JONATHAN:

01:42:47 WHO GOES FIRST, MOST PEOPLE ASSUME IT'S THE ECB.

01:42:52 DON'T WORRY, I KEEP FORGETTING THE DATA WEEK AS WELL. TOM:

01:42:58 EVERY DAY IS FRIDAY. JONATHAN:

01:43:04 FUTURES 0.09%. TOM:

01:43:13 THERE'S OIL, WEST TEXAS UNDER 70, BRENT CRUDE AT 73.

01:43:18 CAN YOU IMAGINE A GLOBAL OIL PRICE OF $69?

01:43:19 HOW THAT CHANGES POLITICS? JONATHAN:

01:43:24 IS CHANGE THE DEBATE AROUND THIS WITH LEVELS WE HAVEN'T

01:43:27 SEEN SINCE JUNE.

01:43:34 TOM: WE WILL BEGIN IN THIS HOUR OUR

01:43:43 ANALYSIS OF WHAT WE WILL DO OFF THE FED MEETING.

01:43:54 ONE OF YOUR ANALYST HAD A SPECTACULAR CHART OUT ABOUT

01:44:00 WHAT THE MARKETS DO AFTER YOU GET A PEEK IN YIELDS IN THE

01:44:02 QUESTION NOW IS CASH. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH

01:44:08 ALL OF THAT CASH ONCE THE 5% YIELD COMES DOWN?

01:44:13 >> I HOPE EVERYONE WHO WAS NOT CONSTRUCTIVE ABOUT CASH COMES

01:44:22 INTO NEXT YEAR WITH A LITTLE HUMILITY.

01:44:24 WITH CASH OUTPERFORMING BONDS AND THAT RHETORIC AROUND WHAT

01:44:29 INVESTORS AND MARKETS DO AFTER A PEAK IN RATES IS ROOTED IN

01:44:37 HIKING CYCLES THAT WERE ACCOMPANIED BY A LACK OF

01:44:38 INFLATIONARY BACKDROPS.

01:44:47 IT WOULD BE INSTRUCTIVE TO LOOKI AT THE HIKING CYCLE OF THE 90'S.

01:44:53 INFLATION STAYED AROUND 3%.

01:44:59 IT IS NOT A GIVEN THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE THOSE ULTRASHORT

01:45:03 RATES DROP BUT AT THE SAME TIME, YOU WANT TO HAVE

01:45:07 OPTIONALITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WHAT LISA WAS REFERRING TO

01:45:13 THE HIGHER COST OF CAPITAL FINALLY PUSHING TO HAVE TO

01:45:17 REALIZE THE REALITY THAT THEY HAVE TO REFINANCE AT A HIGHER

01:45:22 CAUSE. ARE THERE COMPANIES THAT SHOULD

01:45:25 NOT HAVE MADE IT PAST 2020?

01:45:31 ALL OF THAT IS IN THE MIX AND I THINK IT'S INTERESTING THAT YOU

01:45:34 SAID YOU WERE TRYING TO READ THE TEA LEAVES TO A MARKET WE

01:45:35 DON'T UNDERSTAND. I DON'T THINK THE FED

01:45:38 UNDERSTANDS WHAT'S HAPPENING. THE FED IS SAYING WE'RE NOT

01:45:48 DOING ANYTHING AT BEST IN THE MARKET IS THINKING YOU'RE GOING

01:45:49 TO EASE 110 POINTS.

01:45:55 THIS IS THE WHY OF PROBABLY WE HAVE SEEN AND DRAMATIC EASING

01:45:59 OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS WILL FIZZLE OUT AS THE FED DOES NOT

01:46:04 DELIVER CUTS BECAUSE INFLATION REMAINS ABOVE TARGET.

01:46:11 LABOR MARKET IS STRONG, EQUITY MARKETS DOING WELL. JONATHAN:

01:46:18 I'M THINKING THE 363 BASIS POINTS DOESN'T GET YOU EXCITED?

01:46:20 OKSANA: IT SHOULD NOT GET ANYONE EXCITED BECAUSE WHEN WE THINK

01:46:24 OF THE HIGHER RATE CYCLE AND

01:46:31 WHO THAT IMPACTS IS THE LOWER RATED CREDIT OPERATORS.

01:46:35 WE HAVE A CREDIT MARKET THAT IS LOW-QUALITY CREDIT SKEWED.

01:46:44 THIS IS THE PRODUCT OF MANY YEARS, DECADES OF LOWER AND

01:46:45 LOWER RATES. JUST LIKE THE INTEREST RATE

01:46:52 RECKONING TOOK ITS TIME TO ARRIVE, THE CREDIT RECKONING

01:46:54 MAY TAKE IT'S TIME TO ARRIVE BUT IT WILL ARRIVE WITH PRICING.

01:46:59 LISA: YOU EXPRESSED A LITTLE FRUSTRATION ABOUT PEOPLE WHO

01:47:02 PUSH BACK AGAINST YOUR CASH CALL. OKSANA:

01:47:06 I THOUGHT I WAS BEING SUBTLE. LISA:

01:47:13 IF ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE, SHOULD HAVE SOME HUMILITY BEFORE

01:47:15 CONDEMNING MY CALLS. WHEN DID THEY START TO PUT THAT

01:47:18 CASH TO WORK? WHEN DO THEY START SHIFTING IT

01:47:25 INTO OTHER ASSET CLASSES AT A TIME WHEN THERE IS POTENTIAL

01:47:29 DISTRESS AND YOU EXPECT SPREADS TO WIDEN? OKSANA:

01:47:33 WHERE DO THEY WANT TO PUT IT TO WORK?

01:47:35 WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FIXED INCOME AND CREDIT.

01:47:48 WE MAKE A CALL ON THE CREDIT SIDE, IT'S JUST NOT ENOUGH

01:47:55 COMPOSITION TO TAKE THAT RISK AND THAT SPREAD IS SOMEWHERE IN

01:47:56 THE LOW 500'S. UNTIL HE GETS THERE I WOULD BE

01:47:58 CAUTIOUS. THERE WILL BE POCKETS WHERE YOU

01:48:09 COULD DO SOME THINGS AND INTERESTINGLY PRICE POSITIONS.

01:48:12 ON THE INTEREST RATE SIDE, YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER WHAT IS THE

01:48:15 10-YEAR TREASURY YIELD? IT'S ESSENTIALLY GDP PLUS

01:48:17 INFLATION PLUS MONITOR PREMIUM.

01:48:30 LET'S ASSUME IS POSITIVE, GDP PLUS INFLATION GETS US INTO THE

01:48:37 MID-FIVES AND SO FROM A FAIR VALUE STANDPOINT, THAT IS WHERE

01:48:39 THAT PART OF THE CURVE WILL LOOK ATTRACTIVE. LISA:

01:48:43 THAT'S A PRETTY BOLD CALL. YOU ARE NOT BUYING 10-YEAR

01:48:46 TREASURY YIELD'S UNTIL THEY GO OVER 5%? OKSANA:

01:48:50 CORRECT BUT THERE ARE POCKETS OF THE MARKET THAT ARE

01:48:56 INTERESTING TO BUY. INVESTMENT GRADE FLOATERS.

01:48:59 OUR THEME COMING INTO NEXT YEAR 'S STAY HIGH-QUALITY BUT DO IT

01:49:02 IN A FLOATING-RATE MATTER.

01:49:09 MANNER. BECAUSE THIS FIGHT IS NOT

01:49:10 GOING TO BE PRICING IN THESE AGGRESSIVE CUTS.

01:49:21 SO NORTH OF 6% THAT RESET DAILY, THAT'S A GREAT TRADE.

01:49:24 YOU ARE NOT EXPOSED TO ALL OF THAT WHILE GYRATION RELATED TO

01:49:28 INTEREST RATE RISKS WE'VE SEEN THIS YEAR.

01:49:32 THE BLOOMBERG AGGREGATE WAS DOWN 3% AND NOW IT'S UP 3%.

01:49:38 THAT'S A 6% SWING, THIS SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING WITH FIXED

01:49:43 DURATION. JONATHAN: WHAT IS THE RATE CUT CALL YOU

01:49:46 REALLY DON'T LIKE? OKSANA:

01:49:53 THERE IS NOTHING FUNDAMENTALLY UNDERPINNING IT.

01:49:58 THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN POINT TO DO SAY THIS IS WHY WE NEED A

01:50:04 RATE CUT IN THE CALLS OF PRICING IN AN AGGRESSIVE CUT IS

01:50:06 BASED ON THE FACT THAT THE FED IS DONE HIKING.

01:50:09 PERHAPS THAT'S TRUE BUT THE DATA WILL TELL US.

01:50:12 JUST BECAUSE IT'S NOT HIKING DOES NOT MEAN IT NEEDS TO MOVE

01:50:16 THE CUTTING AND CERTAINLY NOT CUTTING AS AGGRESSIVELY.

01:50:20 HISTORY TELLS US THAT AS INFLATION REMAINS ELEVATED THE

01:50:23 FED IS NOT FREE TO CUT. JONATHAN:

01:50:29 IS THIS BASED ON REAL RATES? AS INFLATION COMES DOWN YOU

01:50:33 DON'T WANT POLICY TO GET TIGHTER? OKSANA:

01:50:37 SURGICAL CUTS BEING THE KEY.

01:50:47 CAN WE SEE THE FED GOING THROUGH A COUPLE OF CUTS AT THE

01:50:52 END OF 2020 FOUR? PERHAPS. BUT THE MORE IMPORTANT QUESTION

01:50:54 IS, HIGHER FOR LONGER.

01:51:00 A 25, 50 BASIS POINT CUT IS STILL HIGHER FOR LONGER AT WHAT

01:51:06 IS THAT DUE FOR CORPORATE BALANCE SHEETS THAT HAVE RELIED

01:51:07 ON CHEAP MONEY AND I THINK THERE WILL BE A DRAMATIC

01:51:10 REPRICING THERE. JONATHAN:

01:51:16 I ALWAYS APPRECIATE YOUR PESSIMISM. OKSANA:

01:51:20 IT'S JUST A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR INVESTORS.

01:51:23 FOR THOSE WHO ARE WILLING TO BE REALISTIC.

01:51:29 THAT SCENARIO CAN UNFOLD WITHOUT A BROADER RECESSION IN

01:51:31 THE ECONOMY.

01:51:39 I DON'T THINK THAT VIEW IS PESSIMISTIC.

01:51:42 YOU CAN HAVE SPECIFIC INDUSTRY RECESSIONS THAT COULD CREATE

01:51:44 OPPORTUNITIES LIKE WE SAW IN THE REGIONAL BANKS. JONATHAN:

01:51:50 LISA'S GOING TO QUOTE YOU FOR THE REST OF THE MORNING. LISA:

01:51:52 100%. JONATHAN: IF YOU ARE JUST JOINING US, IT

01:51:58 IS FED DECISION DAY. S&P UP .11%.

01:52:09 THE DOT PLOT AND THE NEWS CONFERENCE WITH CHAIRMAN POWELL.

01:52:13 TOM: WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE NEWS CONFERENCE, HE WILL STOP

01:52:17 POLITELY WITH A PREPARED STATEMENT.

01:52:22 AT THE NEWS CONFERENCE I THINK HE'S GOING TO THROW IT INTO THE

01:52:28 NEXT SEQUENTIAL SET OF MEETINGS. HE HAS TO STAGGER IT OUT UNTIL

01:52:29 THE MARCH MEETING. JONATHAN:

01:52:35 GIVE AN ASSESSMENT OF INFLATION WHETHER HE THINKS IT'S STICKY

01:52:36 YOU'RE NOT PRESSING AGAINST THAT HOPE OF A CUT?

01:53:46 >> IF WE SEE STABILITY AND INFLATION AND AS WE MOVE THE

01:53:49 CALENDAR PAGE AND 2024 WE SEE AN UPTICK, THAT COULD FORCE THE

01:53:54 HEADS HAND TO TAKE ONE FINAL INCREASE TO CONVINCE THE MARKET

01:53:59 THAT THREE IS NOT THE NEW TWO. JONATHAN:

01:54:03 THAT RIGHT THERE IS YOUR PUSHBACK GOING INTO THE NEWS

01:54:06 CONFERENCE LATER ON THIS AFTERNOON. TOM:

01:54:08 OUR TEAM IS GIFTED. THEY ABSOLUTELY NAILED IT AND

01:54:18 FOR EVERYONE OUT THERE , THEY ARE REALLY PUSHING BACK

01:54:24 AGAINST THE ZEITGEIST. JONATHAN: WE HAVE HAD A 10% MOVE ON THE

01:54:27 S&P.

01:54:39 WE BEEN PRICING IN A HUNDRED ON THE DOT PLOTS.

01:54:42 THE DIRECTION OF THE DATA IS ENCOURAGING BUT DO YOU THINK

01:54:46 CHAIRMAN POWELL CONSENT THERE AND GIVE A RINGING ENDORSEMENT

01:54:47 OF WHAT WE SEE IN THE MARKET? LISA:

01:54:53 SHE SAID IT'S GOING TO BE EASIER IN THAT LAST MILE SO YOU

01:54:54 CAN SAY WHAT SHE SAID. JONATHAN: WITH WHAT SECRETARY GALEN SAID,

01:55:09 IF YOU REPEATED WHAT THEY SAID AFTER THE PAYROLL REPORT, THAT

01:55:10 IS A RINGING ENDORSEMENT. TOM:

01:55:16 THIS IS RICHARD TIMBERLAKE AND ALAN MELTZER AND BERNANKE

01:55:23 TEACHING IN PRINCETON, THE LIBERALS AND CONSERVATIVES

01:55:28 AGREE, THEY HAVE TO WAIT IN THE JOB MARKET HAS NOT GIVEN THEM

01:55:29 THAT SIGNAL. JONATHAN: THE STOCK MARKET DOES NOT WAIT.

01:55:38 TOM: EXPECTATIONS OUT THERE AND THE

01:55:46 ONLY THING I'M WAITING FOR A PEOPLE WATCH ANYTHING BESIDES

01:55:48 NETFLIX. JONATHAN: WHAT'S YOUR NEW SHOW?

01:55:56 TOM: IT'S LOW HORSES, IT'S ABOUT SPIES, IS REALLY WELL DONE.

01:56:07 THERE HAS BEEN A BOMBSHELL FOR HOLLYWOOD OVERNIGHT.

01:56:11 ABOVE THE GETTING OUT FRONT.

01:56:19 WE ALL WATCH THE SAME 200 MOVIES, HOW DOES THIS CHANGE

01:56:20 THE TECHNOLOGY OF ENTERTAINMENT? >> IT GIVES US TRANSPARENCY ON

01:56:27 WHAT WERE WATCHING AND WITH THE PROXIMITY WE HAVE HAD TO THE

01:56:37 STRIKES.

01:56:38 WE HAVE WANTED TO KNOW WHAT HE WAS WATCHING WHAT ON NETFLIX

01:56:39 AND WHAT VOLUME.

01:56:46 TO SEE OVERNIGHT THE MARKET COMPLAIN ABOUT THE DATA WE'VE

01:56:51 GOT BUT IT SHOWS THAT THE SPEND NETFLIX IS DOING ON THEIR OWN

01:56:54 CONTENT VERSUS THE TITLES ARE BUYING FROM OTHERS AND IT TELLS

01:56:59 THE ACTORS, ARE THEY BEING PAID ENOUGH FOR THE WORK BEING DONE.

01:57:04 TOM: I'M GOING TO GO BACK TO THE WINTER OF 1964 WITH THE STONES

01:57:11 AND BEATLES DID THIS AND THAT. ARE THEY GOING TO BE PROFITABLE

01:57:16 AS AN INDUSTRY?

01:57:23 WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ANALYSIS OVERNIGHT IS THERE ANY

01:57:24 INDICATION OF FUTURE PROFITABILITY?

01:57:34 >> AT LEAST THE DATA CAN GUIDE NETFLIX WHAT AND WHERE PEOPLE

01:57:37 ARE WATCHING IT AND WHAT NOT TO SPEND ON.

01:57:40 FOR THE LAST 18 MONTHS THERE HAS BEEN AN ARGUMENT IF THIS

01:57:47 MODEL WILL EVER BE PROFITABLE AND EVERYONE HAS FOLLOWED SUIT.

01:57:51 THERE HAS BEEN A BIG PULLBACK. NETFLIX HAS A HYBRID MODEL

01:57:57 WHERE IT HAS TO KEEP TURNING OUT LIBRARIES OF CONTENT TO

01:58:01 KEEP THE EYEBALLS COMING AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THOSE

01:58:06 WATCHLIST IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE IT DOMINATED BY WHAT THEY

01:58:07 PRODUCE THEMSELVES. LISA: I WOULD WATCH A DRAMATIC SERIES

01:58:13 ABOUT ELON MUSK AND I WOULD BE CURIOUS WHAT THE EPISODE WOULD

01:58:17 LOOK LIKE WITH THESE POTENTIAL RECALLS COMING OUT GIVING THE

01:58:25 FACT THAT TESLA FILED A NEW RECALL AFFECTING TWO MILLION

01:58:28 VEHICLES HAVING TO DO WITH THE SELF-DRIVING SYSTEM. ED:

01:58:34 THE STOCK IS DOWN 1% PREMARKET. I DON'T HAVE A BLOOMBERG IN

01:58:38 FRONT OF ME. IT'S A RECALL IN NAME ONLY.

01:58:43 YES, 2 MILLION VEHICLES ARE IMPACTED.

01:58:47 THE FIX IS NOT OVER YET.

01:59:07 THERE'S AN ARGUMENTTHERE'S AN ARGUMENT TO SAY HOW FANTASTIC

01:59:08 IS IT THAT TESLA AFTER A MULTIYEAR INVESTIGATION

01:59:15 -- APPROACH TO SELF DRIVING?

01:59:22 IN THIS CASE, THIS IS AUTOPILOT. THE BASIC DRIVER ASSISTANCE IT

01:59:28 DOES NOT RELATE TO THE FULL SELF-DRIVING DATA.

01:59:36 THE ONE THAT TESLA HAS CURRENTLY IN TESTING.

01:59:42 YOU COVER THIS AND THIS IS MY REAL QUESTION.

01:59:43 ARE YOU SURPRISED BY THE SKEPTICISM?

01:59:49 ED: IT'S MORE COMMONPLACE TO SEE A

01:59:54 LEGIT ROBOTAXI ON THE STREET. BUT THE END MARKET FEEDBACK IS

02:00:01 THAT PEOPLE REALLY LIKE THESE PRODUCTS AND THEREIN LIES THE

02:00:05 DATE -- DEBATE. WHO ARE THEY REGULATING FOR?

02:00:11 SAFETY INVESTIGATORS HAVE FOUND THAT THE CRASH WAS RELATED OR

02:00:15 PARTLY CAUSED BY THE USE OF AUTOPILOT AND IN SOME CASE THE

02:00:19 SELF-DRIVING BETA. BUT THOSE ARE SMALL CASES AND

02:00:26 THE DEGREE OF ACCIDENTS LINKED TO THOSE TECHNOLOGIES IS

02:00:28 SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THOSE LINKED TO HUMAN ERROR.

02:00:34 IF YOU'RE A TESLA CUSTOMER HE WAS BENEFITING FROM THIS WE

02:00:38 FEEL THAT WE'VE IMPROVE SAFETY ON PUBLIC ROADS RELATIVE THOSE

02:00:43 ACCIDENTS CAUSED BY HUMAN MISTAKES. JONATHAN:

02:00:51 WE'VE HAD A BIT OF A REALITY CHECK.

02:00:54 WHAT WAS YOUR TAKE AWAY FROM WHAT FORD HIS SIDE IN THE PAST

02:00:55 COUPLE OF DAYS? ED:

02:01:06 THE DEMAND POCKET HAS BEEN AND GONE.

02:01:07 THE POCKET OF THE MARKET IS WILLING TO PAY A HIGHER PRICE

02:01:15 TO CLAIM THAT THERE FIRST. THE DEMAND PICTURE IS IN QUESTION.

02:01:20 IT'S AN ECONOMIC STORY AFTER YOUR MORTGAGE AND RATE PAYMENT

02:01:26 THE FINANCING OF A CAR IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE OUTGOING FOR

02:01:27 YOUR HOUSEHOLD. THERE IS TANGIBLE EVIDENCE OF

02:01:32 THAT PICTURE.

02:01:38 NOVEMBER WAS THE BEST MONTH FOR THE LIGHTNING AND THEN FOUR

02:01:43 WEEKS LATER THEY CUT THEIR OUTPUT FOR NEXT YEAR SO WHAT

02:01:45 ARE THEY KNOW ABOUT THE CONSUMER THAT WE DON'T?

02:01:48 JONATHAN: ED LUDLOW ON THE WEST COAST,

02:01:55 ONE OF THE HEADLINES OF THE WEEK, FORD CUTTING PRODUCTION

02:01:58 IN HALF FOR THE F-150 LIGHTNING TRUCK.

02:02:04 TOM: MOSTLY WHAT IT IS IS MARKETING,

02:02:13 STUDYING YEAR END CONSUMER I REALLY WONDER IF THEY HAVE A

02:02:15 KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON IN THE SHOWROOM AND

02:02:19 WHAT'S GOING ON DURING THE FOOTBALL GAME WHEN YOU SEE FOUR

02:02:21 ADS IN A ROW.

02:02:27 JONATHAN: I GUESS HE FOUND OUT PRETTY

02:02:29 QUICKLY. COMING UP, KATHY JONES, BOB

02:02:36 MICHELE OF JP MORGAN, A FIGHT

02:02:57 SURVEILLANCE EXCLUSIVE EXCITED ABOUT CPI.

02:03:10 JONATHAN FERRO HAD A FOUR HAS NAP LIKE HE IS WANT TO DO.

02:03:16 CPI, IT'S NOT CPI IS IT? LISA:

02:03:25 IF YOU GET SOME KIND OF SURPRISE, MICHAEL MCKEE WOULD

02:03:27 KNOW IT. MIKE: WERE GETTING A LITTLE BIT OF

02:03:31 SURPRISE.

02:03:41 WE HAVE A FLAT READING AFTER HALF PERCENT DECLINE AFTER

02:03:44 OCTOBER.

02:03:50 COURT COMING IN AT 0.0 LOWER THAN THE TWOS-TENS FORECAST.

02:04:04 0.9 ON PPI FOR DEMAND AND COR AT 2%.

02:04:10 ONE INFLATION NUMBER IS A 2% WITH ANOTHER BELOW THA
