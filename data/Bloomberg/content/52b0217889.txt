00:11 >> THERE IS A LITTLE SHIFT UNDERWAY HERE THAT WE OUGHT TO

00:14 BE MINDFUL OF.

00:15 >> WE SHOULD SEE POSITIVE ACTION THROUGH THE END OF THE

00:16 YEAR.

00:19 >> THE HEIGHTENING MACRO UNCERTAINTY MEANS INVESTORS

00:21 NEED TO BE NIMBLE.

00:22 >> WE DO NOT THINK THERE WILL BE MORE RATE HIKES FROM THE FED.

00:26 >> IT IS FAR TOO EARLY TO TALK ABOUT EASING.

00:27 >> THIS IS "BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE"

00:28 WITH TOM KEENE, JONATHAN FERRO, AND LISA ABRAMOWICZ. JONATHAN:

00:33 LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY, GOOD MORNING.

00:34 FOR OUR AUDIENCE WORLDWIDE,

00:40 THIS IS "BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE" ON TV AND RADIO.

00:43 ALONGSIDE LISA ABRAMOWICZ, I AM JONATHAN FERRO.

00:45 EQUITY MARKETS PULLING BACK, BUT WHAT A RALLY OVER THE LAST

00:48 WEEK OR SO. SIX-DAY WINNING STREAK ON THE

00:51 S&P 500, SEVEN ON THE NASDAQ 100.

00:54 THE NASDAQ 100 UP BY MORE THAN 7%. LISA:? ?

00:58 IS IT DURABLE EVERYONE WAS SAYING IT COMES DOWN TO WHETHER

00:59 WE GET STABILITY IN YIELDS. CLEARLY, THERE IS A FEELING OF

01:04 UNEASE WE GOT FROM THAT YESTERDAY, AND SOME FED

01:07 OFFICIALS ARE PUSHING BACK ON THAT.

01:09 ARE WE GOING TO HEAR MORE OF THAT? JONATHAN:

01:12 NEEL KASHKARI IN ABOUT 90 MINUTES TIME.

01:17 TOO EARLY, TOO SOON TO DECLARE VICTORY. LISA:

01:20 HOW MUCH IS HE PUSHING BACK SAYING WE'D RATHER ERR ON THE

01:25 SIDE OF OVER TIGHTENING THEN UNDER TIGHTENING.

01:28 AT A CERTAIN POINT? , WHO MATTERS?

01:31 DOES NEEL KASHKARI MATTER MORE THAN FED CHAIR JAY POWELL?

01:38 IS THIS A GAME OF CHICKEN, OR IS THERE SOMETHING MORE

01:39 MATERIAL HERE? JONATHAN: LET'S GET TO THE PUSHBACK.

01:46 MORGAN STANLEY, THE PUSHBACK. WE FIND IT DIFFICULT TO GET

01:50 MORE EXCITED ABOUT A YEAR END RALLY. DOVISH CENTRAL BANKS,

01:55 "KNEE-JERK POSITIVE EQUITIES IN THE SHORT-TERM, BUT THE GROWTH

02:03 WILL -- LISA: THE PROBLEM IS THEY HAVE BEEN

02:04 WRONG ALL YEAR. THIS IS A PROBLEM WHEN YOU HAVE

02:07 GOT INVESTORS WHO HAVE GONE INTO EQUITIES DESPITE SOME OF

02:11 THESE WARNINGS AND HAVE MADE BANK, SO AT A CERTAIN POINT,

02:15 YOU HAVE TO THINK, OK, IF THE COMPANIES ARE DELIVERING, YOU

02:22 BETTER DANCE WHILE THE MUSIC IS PLAYING.

02:25 THAT, FROM ALL THE NOTES I'VE BEEN READING, AND MANY OF OUR

02:27 GUESTS ARE SAYING. JONATHAN: WHAT IF I TOLD YOU YOU COULD BE

02:32 REALLY WRONG BUT STILL BANK HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS DOLLARS?

02:34 LISA: I WILL. BE IN THE WRONG BUSINESS.

02:37 JONATHAN: WEWORK IN 2017. HERE WE ARE, FOUR YEARS LATER,

02:43 AND THE COMPANY'S FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY.

02:47 IN THE MEANTIME, ADAM NEUMANN, THE FOUNDER OF THE COMPANY,

02:51 MANAGED TO TAKE IN HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

02:52 THAT IS UNREAL. LISA:

02:58 THERE IS A QUESTION OF HOW MUCH HE PERSONALLY PROFITED AND

03:00 THERE IS A QUESTION OF HOW MANY BROKEN BUSINESS MODELS WHERE

03:05 THERE DURING THE PANDEMIC WITH EXECUTIVES GETTING MASSIVE

03:07 SALARIES BECAUSE THEY COUNTED ON A FREE PIGGY BANK THAT WAS

03:11 THE DEBT MARKET THAT NO LONGER EXISTS.

03:13 WE EXPECTED TO SEE MORE OF THIS. HE MIGHT THE PRIME POSTER CHILD

03:16 OF THIS, BUT WE AFFECTED TO SEE MORE OF THIS AT A TIME WHEN YOU

03:20 HAD A COMPANY THAT LOCKS IN 10 TO 20 YEAR LEASES AND SAID YOU

03:23 COULD COME HERE FOR A MONTH AT A TIME, PAY AS A SALARY, AND WE

03:28 WILL GIVE YOU FREE BEER AND A PING-PONG TABLE.

03:30 AT WHAT POINT DO YOU SAY THIS IS AN ANOMALY VERSUS SOMETHING

03:31 THAT HAS SOME INDICATIONS OF WHAT IS TO COME? JONATHAN:

03:35 ARE YOU DIGESTING WE FAILED TO ELEVATE THE WORLD'S

03:38 CONSCIOUSNESS? [LAUGHTER] YOU ARE RAISING THE RIGHT

03:44 QUESTION FOR IT HAVE WE FULLY REALIZE THE PAIN ASSOCIATED

03:46 WITH TAKING INTEREST RATES FROM 0% THROUGH 5%? NO.

03:49 THERE IS STILL MORE PAIN TO COME.

03:53 TWO, WE SHOULD DO A SPECIAL ON THE WINNERS OF XERB.

03:58 ADAM NEUMANN HAS GOT TO BE A MAJOR CANDIDATE FOR WINNING

03:59 THAT ERA. LISA: THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO

04:04 ARE CANDIDATES FOR JUST LOOK AT THE STOCKS ARE PARABOLIC IN THE

04:07 OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF THE PANDEMIC.

04:09 WHO WAS LOADED DURING AN IMPRESSION OF ANOTHER ERA, AND

04:13 WHO USED THIS MONEY TO INVEST HEAVILY WITH ALL OF THESE

04:14 IDEALS? I AM THINKING OF PELOTON, FOR

04:19 EXAMPLE. THERE ARE A NUMBER THAT CAME

04:23 OUT WITH HIGHFALUTIN CONCEPTS THAT DROVE BORROWING BUT DID

04:29 NOT DRIVE PROFITS. JONATHAN: EQUITY FUTURES ON THE S&P 500

04:33 NEGATIVE BY 0.2%. A BIG RALLY ON THE EQUITY

04:37 MARKET. THE LONGEST DAILY WINNING

04:39 STREAK SINCE THE MIDDLE OF JUNE. YESTERDAY, BOND YIELDS ACTUALLY

04:43 HIGHER AND EQUITIES DID OK. THIS MORNING, LOWER BY FIVE

04:45 BASIS POINTS. LISA: I LOVE YIELDS CAN GO UP OR DOWN

04:51 ON BASIS POINTS, AND IT IS JUST A MILD ABOUT THIS POINT.

04:54 WE GET A HOST OF FEDEX BECOME INCLUDING CHRIS WALLER AND WE

05:00 WILL ALSO HEAR FROM FED PRESIDENTS FROM CHICAGO, KANSAS

05:04 CITY, NEW YORK, DALLAS, AND OF COURSE, MINNEAPOLIS FED

05:07 PRESIDENT NEEL KASHKARI. HE IS SPEAKING TO US AND

05:11 MICHAEL MCKEE AT 7:30 A.M. I WANT TO KNOW HOW FAR HE WILL

05:13 PUSH BACK AGAINST SOME OF THE THROUGH THE AS HIM --

05:18 ENTHUSIASM WE ARE SEEING IN THE MARKET. JONATHAN:

05:21 ARE THERE REASONS FOR THIS FEDERAL RESERVE TO BE MORE

05:23 TOLERANT OF EASING FINANCIAL CONDITIONS?

05:28 GIVEN UNEMPLOYMENT IS SHIFTING A LITTLE BIT HIGHER, WAGE

05:30 GROWTH A LITTLE MORE SUBDUED. THAT WILL BE THE QUESTION A

05:33 LITTLE BIT LATER. LISA: SURGICAL CUTS.

05:41 THE SURGICAL SALES, 1:00 P.M., U.S.

05:44 TREASURIES SENDING $40 BILLION OF THREE-YEAR NOTES AT A TIME.

05:47 THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT WILL BEAT FRONT LOADING A LOT OF

05:50 THESE SALES. WE HAD THREE STRAIGHT, VERY BAD

05:53 AUCTIONS IN THE RECENT SLATE OF AUCTIONS, ONE OF THE FIRST

05:58 TIMES THAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE 2011.

06:00 DO WE SEE SOMETHING DIFFERENT THIS WEEK?

06:04 AND TODAY IS ELECTION DAY, SO IF YOUR KIDS ARE IN PUBLIC

06:08 SCHOOL, THEY ARE NOT IN SCHOOL TODAY.

06:10 WHAT I AM PERSONALLY INTERESTED IN IS WHAT IS GOING ON IN

06:12 VIRGINIA. GLENN YOUNGKIN, A POTENTIAL

06:16 REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, IS

06:20 TRYING TO FLIP THE SENATE IN VIRGINIA TO REPUBLICAN TO GET A

06:23 SWEEP. CURRENTLY, THE HOUSE IS REPUBLICAN.

06:27 IF YOU CAN GET THAT, THERE WILL BE A LOT OF CALLS FOR HIM TO

06:30 RUN INSTEAD OF PRESIDENT TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP.

06:32 JONATHAN: IT IS AMAZING WE ARE TALKING

06:36 ABOUT POTENTIAL NOMINEES FOR AN ELECTION THAT IS LESS THAN 12

06:38 MONTHS AWAY. FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT EVEN

06:39 RUNNING. WE ARE STILL PLAYING THAT GAME.

06:43 LISA: ANECDOTALLY, IS HE NOT GOING TO

06:45 PSEUDO-FUNDRAISERS WITH BIG PEOPLE WITH BIG POCKETBOOKS ON

06:48 WALL STREET WHO WOULD LOVE FOR HIM TO RUN?

06:55 JONATHAN: MUHAMMAD YUNUS OF GALLUP WILL

06:59 COME ON THE PROGRAM AND TELL YOU HOW DEEPLY UNPOPULAR BOTH

07:03 ALREADY'S ARE WITH THE ELECTORATE.

07:06 I AM TALKING ABOUT THE FORMER PRESIDENT AND THE CURRENT

07:07 PRESIDENT AS WELL. LISA: NOBODY WANTS THAT ELECTION, YET

07:13 THAT SEEMS TO BE THE ELECTION WE HAVE HERE WE ARE RUNNING OUT

07:15 OF ROOM FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO COME IN, SO WILL THIS BE THE

07:16 MOMENT? IF HE DOES GET A CLEAN SWEEP IN

07:22 THE HOUSE AND SENATE, TURNING TO THE GOP IN A VERY PURPLE

07:28 STATE, DO YOU END UP WITH A LOT OF CALLS FOR GLENN YOUNGKIN TO

07:31 BE THE REPUBLICAN RESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE? JONATHAN:

07:38 JOINING US NOW, GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST AT ERORO.

07:44 YOUR WORDS --GROUNDS FOR CONTRARIAN OPTIMISM.

07:47 HOW CONTRARIAN IS THAT AFTER THE WEEK WE HAVE HAD?

07:51 >> PRETTY CONTRARIAN. THE RALLY YOU HAVE SEEN OVER

07:57 THE LAST WEEK IS BASICALLY BEING SHORT COVERING.

08:00 IT IS THIS CONSENSUS CAUGHT

08:07 WRONGFOOTED BY THIS EASING -- WE HAVE SEEN THAT NOW WORK THE

08:09 OTHER WAY. WE HAVE SEEN THE RELIEF TRADE.

08:14 BUT FROM HERE, THAT EASING BUYS, THE END OF THE EARNINGS

08:20 RECESSION, AND THIS GOOD FOURTH-QUARTER SEASON, WHICH

08:25 STILL INCLUDES FOUR SENTIMENT, A YEAR AHEAD REPOSITIONING

08:29 RALLY IS STILL TO COME AS PEOPLE FOCUS ON A BETTER 2024.

08:34 AND THROW IN THE RESTART OF BUYBACKS.

08:37 I THINK IT WILL BE A GOOD FOURTH-QUARTER. JONATHAN:

08:40 DO YOU THINK THERE ARE REASONS FOR THE FED TO BE MORE TOLERANT

08:43 OF EASING FINANCIAL CONDITIONS? BEN:

08:49 AT THE MARGIN, BUT YOU WILL NOT HEAR FROM THEM.

08:52 THEY WILL HAVE TO WALK THE TALK CARE THEY WANT FINANCIAL GOOD

08:54 ADDITIONS TO STAY REASONABLY TIGHT TO DO THE WORK FOR THEM.

08:58 IF THEY GIVE AN INCH, THE MARKET WILL TAKE A MILE.

09:02 THEY WILL DO ALL THEY HAVE TO DO, BUT I WOULD TAKE IT WITH A

09:05 GRAIN OF SALT. LISA: WE WERE TALKING ABOUT MORGAN

09:12 STANLEY, JPMORGAN, OTHER STRATEGISTS WHO ARE STILL

09:13 BEARISH ON RISK ASSETS HEADING INTO YEAR END, ESPECIALLY

09:17 BECAUSE OF WEAKNESS TO COME. GIVEN WALL STREET BEARISHNESS,

09:20 DOES THAT MAKE YOU MORE BEARISH OR MORE BULLISH? BEN:

09:25 IT MAKE ME MORE BULLISH AT THE MARGIN.

09:27 I THINK THIS FOUR SENTIMENT THAT IS OUT THERE IS A

09:31 SIGNIFICANT INGREDIENT OF IMPROVING THE RISK REWARD.

09:35 THIS POOR SENTIMENT DOES TWO THINGS.

09:37 IT MEANS THERE IS A LOT OF MONEY SITTING ON THE SIDELINES

09:39 THAT COULD COME INTO THIS MARKET IF I AM RIGHT, THINGS

09:43 GET INCREMENTALLY BETTER. AND IT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES

09:47 RISK-REWARD. IF WE GET BAD NEWS, IT IS

09:49 ALREADY PRICED IN. YOU DO NOT NEED NEWS FOR THIS

09:52 MARKET TO MOVE HIGHER. YOU JUST NEED LESS BAD NEWS.

09:56 WE GOT A HUGE REMINDER OF THAT LAST WEEK.

09:59 WE SAW UNWINDING OF SIX WEEKS OF UNDERPERFORMANCE IN ONE WEEK

10:02 TO OUR SHOW TO A LOT OF PEOPLE THE RISKS OF BEING OUT OF THIS

10:06 MARKET. LISA: ONE THING THAT DEFIES MY SENSE

10:09 OF REASONABLENESS IS PEOPLE KEEP TALKING ABOUT THE

10:11 EXCESSIVE BEARISHNESS OUT THERE. LOOKING AT YEAR-TO-DATE GAINS

10:14 ON THE NASDAQ OF 30% AND MORE THAN 15% IN THE S&P.

10:19 IT DOES NOT SCREAM EVERYONE IS ON THE SIDELINES, SITTING UNDER

10:21 A BLANKET. BEN:

10:29 SO WE HAVE THE EARNINGS SENTIMENT INDEX WHICH IS NOT

10:31 THE LEVEL OF MAXIMUM BEARISHNESS THAT IT WAS 6, 7

10:35 MONTHS AGO, BUT IT IS ABSOLUTELY BELOW AVERAGE.

10:38 IN THIS SUMMER PULLBACK WE SAW, IT FELL BELOW AVERAGE.

10:41 WE ARE FOCUSED ON THE FUNDAMENTALS.

10:43 THAT IS WHAT WILL GET THIS MARKET HIGHER.

10:46 IT WILL NOT BE SENTIMENT. THAT IS THE ICING ON THE CAKE.

10:53 I THINK WE HAVE SEEN THE TOP OF BOND YIELDS.

10:58 I DO NOT THINK WE SEE OIL SUSTAINABLY ABOVE $90.

11:00 WE HAD THE END OF THE U.S. EARNINGS RECESSION.

11:03 WE WILL GET CLEAR VISIBILITY ON THE FED GETTING READY TO CUT

11:04 INTEREST RATES. I THINK THE FEDPUT IS BACK.

11:11 THE ECONOMY WILL BE SLOW BUT EARNINGS WILL BE RESILIENT TO

11:13 THAT, AND WE WILL BE DISCOUNTING THE FED CUTS CUT

11:19 THAT ARE COMING -- AND WE WILL BE DISCOUNTING THE FED CUTS

11:20 THAT ARE COMING. JONATHAN: THAT IS NOT A BULL CASE, THAT'S

11:26 THE BULL DREAM. WHY DO YOU THINK THE FED PUTS

11:30 BACK? BEN:

11:36 INFLATION IS AT 4%, PPI IS HALF THAT.

11:39 IF WE GET THAT HARD LANDING, WHICH I DO NOT EXPECT, BUT IF

11:45 WE DO, THAT IS THE MARKET BEAR, AND IT WILL DRAG EARNINGS WITH

11:47 IT. IT WILL PULL INFLATION DOWN, AND INFLATION IS CLOSE ENOUGH

11:52 THAT, IF YOU GET THAT, THE FED CAN START CUTTING INTEREST

11:53 RATES. THIS IS A HUGE DIFFERENCE FROM

11:58 EVEN SIX MONTHS AGO, WHERE THE ECONOMY HAD FALLEN OFF A CLIFF,

12:02 THE FED'S HANDS WERE TIED. LISA: FED PUT WAS TRADITIONALLY THAT,

12:10 IF THERE WAS ANY WEAKNESS, THE FED HAD ALREADY BLANCHED TO

12:12 STIMULATE THE ECONOMY. YOU ARE SAYING THE BAR TO CUT

12:16 RATES HAS BEEN LOWERED MATERIALLY OVER THE LAST COUPLE

12:17 OF WEEKS. IS THAT WHAT I'M HEARING FROM

12:18 YOU? BEN: NO. IT HAS BEEN LOWER MATERIAL OVER

12:23 THE LAST FEW MONTHS. SIX MONTHS AGO, THE FED COULD

12:28 NOT CUT RATES. NOW, IT CAN. IF YOU ARE A BULLISH INVESTOR

12:33 LIKE ME, THAT IS YOUR INSURANCE POLICY FOR THEIR NOT BEING A

12:37 SOFT LANDING AND FOR ME GETTING THE ECONOMY COMPLETELY WRONG.

12:39 I NOW HAVE THE FED STANDING BEHIND ME -- THEY WERE NOT

12:40 STANDING BEHIND ME SIX MONTH AGO. JONATHAN: CUT BACK TO WHAT?

12:45 A LOT OF PEOPLE IN FIXED INCOME OR HAVING THAT DEBATE AND

12:47 CANNOT FIGURE IT OUT. WHERE ARE YOU IN THAT DEBATE?

12:52 BEN: INFLATION IS NOT WHERE IT NEEDS

12:53 TO BE YET. OBVIOUSLY, IF THE ECONOMY

12:59 COOLS, IT WILL COME DOWN A BIT FASTER.

13:03 I DO NOT THINK THE WORLD IS COMPLETELY CHANGED.

13:06 A LOT OF THE STRUCTURAL DRIVERS OF THAT, WHETHER IT IS DEBTS,

13:11 DEMOGRAPHICS, TECHNOLOGY, THEY HAVE NOT GONE ANYWHERE.

13:14 I DO NOT COMPLETELY DISCOUNT IT. JONATHAN: BEN LAIDLER OF ETORO.

13:22 APPRECIATE IT. WHAT HAS CHANGED BETWEEN NOW

13:24 AND LAST WEEK?

13:31 TWO WEEKS AGO, WE WERE NORTH OF 5% ON THE 10 YEAR YIELD AND WE

13:34 WERE TALKING ABOUT BUDGET DEFICITS, YIELD CURVE CONTROL

13:38 AT THE BOJ, A LACK OF EDITABLE BUYERS IN THE TREASURY MARKET,

13:43 A LOSS OF THAT IN PLACES LIKE CHINA, AND HERE WE ARE SITTING,

13:47 WITH CONVICTION, SAYING WE HAVE SEEN THE HIGHS IN BOND YIELDS.

13:48 LISA: WHAT HAS CHANGED IS THAT THE

13:53 EXCESSIVE SHORT POSITIONS ON TREASURIES HAVE BASICALLY BEEN

13:56 WASHED OUT, AND WE SAW SOME REPOSITIONING THERE.

13:59 THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT CAME OUT A THREW THE MARKET IT BONE

14:04 AND SAID WE WILL FOCUS OUR ISSUANCE ON THE SHORT END.

14:08 AND THE FED CAME OUT AND WAS NOT THAT HAWKISH.

14:12 THAT WAS BASICALLY THE INSURANCE POLICY THE BULLS ARE

14:14 LOOKING FOR. JONATHAN: THEY ARE CHEWING HARD ON THAT

14:17 BONE. S&P FUTURES NEGATIVE 12:45 PERCENT.

14:25 NEXT HOUR, NEEL KASHKARI OF THE MINNEAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE.

14:28 LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY THIS MORNING, GOOD MORNING.

14:59 >> WE ARE ANNOUNCING HISTORIC INVESTMENT IN AMERICA'S

15:00 RAILROADS. I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS

15:01 FOR A LONG TIME. FINALLY, WE ARE GETTING IT DONE.

15:09 MORE THAN $16 BILLION.

15:15 TOO MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LEFT THE HIND, OR TREATED LIKE THEY

15:16 WERE INVISIBLE. WE ARE BUILDING AN ECONOMY FROM

15:21 THE MIDDLE OUT AND THE BOTTOM UP, WHERE NO ONE IS LEFT BEHIND.

15:25 JONATHAN: PRESIDENT BIDEN ANNOUNCING $16

15:29 BILLION IN NEW FUNDING FOR PASSENGER RAILS P THIS AHEAD OF

15:33 THE ELECTIONS, WHERE A RECENT NEW YORK TIMES POLL HAS

15:38 PRESIDENT BIDEN TRAILING FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP.

15:43 I DO NOT KNOW ANYONE WHO LOVES AMTRAK ASIDE FROM THE SITTING

15:44 PRESIDENT. I DO NOT GET IT. LISA:

15:50 ESPECIALLY BECAUSE -- I FEEL TERRIBLE, BECAUSE I AM SITTING

15:55 IN TOM'S CHAIR -- BUT YOU COME FROM THE EUROPEAN TRAIN SYSTEM

16:00 THAT IS REALLY FAST -- HONESTLY, YOU GO ANYWHERE, THEY

16:02 ARE FAST, ON-TIME, CLEAN. HERE, THEY HAVE GOT DELAYS P

16:07 THEY RUN THE SAME TRAINS, IF THEY HAVE EXPRESSED, THE ARE

16:10 THE LOCAL ONES, WHICH IS A PROBLEM. JONATHAN:

16:13 I'M AN AMTRAK I. WHAT DOES THAT SAY TO YOU IF

16:17 YOU ARE AN AMTRAK GUY? I DO NOT GET IT.

16:22 YOU COME BACK FROM SWITZERLAND AND YOU SAY I AM A SWISS TRAIN

16:24 GUY, I GET IT. BUT THEY ARE PUTTING $16

16:27 BILLION INTO IT, SO GOOD NEWS. LISA:

16:30 I HOPE THEY BUILD ANOTHER TRACK SO THE EXPRESS CAN ACTUALLY GO

16:32 EXPRESS CARE THAT IS MY DREAM FOR THIS COUNTRY. JONATHAN:

16:36 WE WILL TALK ABOUT AMTRAK JOE IN A MOMENT.

16:39 FUTURES ON THE S&P 500 NEGATIVE BY ONE THIRD OF 1%.

16:41 WE ARE PULLING BACK AFTER A SIX-DAY WINNING STREAK.

16:45 YOU ALWAYS READ THE STORIES AFTER YOU DO NOT GET DAY SEVEN

16:47 NORDEA. WHAT ARE YOU EXPECTING, IT WILL

16:51 MOVE IN THE STRAIGHT-LINE AND KEEP ON GAINING?

16:53 YOU HAVE TO COME UP WITH REASONS IT IS DOWN TODAY.

16:57 IT IS DOWN TODAY BECAUSE NEEL KASHKARI WILL NOT CLAIM VICTORY?

17:00 COME ON, STOP IT. LISA: THIS IS THE REASON WHY THIS

17:05 MARKET HAS BEEN DIZZYING AND DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN AND

17:08 ADDRESS WITH A NEW THESIS, BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE

17:10 HAPPENING. COME UP WITH A NEW THESIS, AND

17:13 EVERYONE WILL JUMP ON BOARD. JONATHAN:

17:16 WE WILL GET TO A PIECE FROM GALLUP -- TWO MAJOR POLITICAL

17:21 PARTIES REMAIN UNPOPULAR IN THE UNITED STATES.

17:24 66 PERCENT OF AMERICANS VIEW THE REPUBLICAN PARTY

17:29 UNFAVORABLY, 68% OF THE SAME VIEW OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

17:34 I'VE BEEN READING THROUGH THIS PIECE.

17:36 NEITHER PARTY IS WELL-LIKED. YOU POINTED OUT THE GOP MAYBE

17:40 HAS AN EDGE ON CERTAIN ISSUES. CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE

17:43 LIKABILITY OF BOTH PARTIES RIGHT NOW? HOW UNUSUAL IS THIS?

17:47 >> UNFORTUNATELY, IT HARKENS TO YOUR AMTRAK CONVERSATION

17:50 EARLIER. THE ARE AT A STATE WHERE BOTH

17:54 PARTIES ARE NOT REALLY DOING THAT GREAT IN TERMS OF

17:55 FAVORABILITY. IT IS NOTHING NEW, UNFORTUNATELY.

18:01 IT HAS BEEN QUITE A WHILE SINCE AMERICANS HAVE HAD A FAVORABLE

18:03 VIEW OF EITHER PARTY IN THE MAJORITY.

18:06 WE ARE ALSO AT A TIME WHERE THERE IS A RECORD HIGH OF

18:07 AMERICANS SAYING THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE A THIRD PARTY IN

18:10 AMERICAN POLITICS. OF COURSE, EASY TO SAY I WANT

18:13 MORE. IT IS NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT

18:17 PARTY WOULD EXIST OR ACTUALLY BE POWERFUL.

18:19 BUT WE ARE ALSO AT A TIME WHERE THERE IS A HIGH OF PEOPLE THAT

18:24 IDENTIFY AS INDEPENDENTS. THAT'S IMPORTANT, NOT ONLY IN

18:31 THE CURRENT MOMENT, BUT ALSO IN OUR ANALYSIS OVER GENERATIONS,

18:33 WHAT WE FIND HIS YOUNGER AMERICANS TODAY ARE ACTUALLY

18:36 STICKING WITH THAT INDEPENDENT ID MUCH FURTHER ALONG THEIR

18:39 LIFESPAN THAN PREVIOUS GENERATIONS.

18:44 SO CERTAINLY, AMERICANS ARE HIGHLY DISSATISFIED WITH

18:45 NATIONAL GOVERNMENT. THEY ARE REALLY, IN SOME WAYS,

18:52 MOST SATISFIED WITH BOTH PARTIES.

18:55 THAT BEING SAID, TODAY IS A LOCAL ELECTION.

18:57 I KNOW IT IS TEMPTING FOR US TO JUMP TO 2024.

19:01 AMERICANS LINE UP TODAY TO VOTE ON LOCAL ISSUES.

19:02 THERE IS A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY PEOPLE PERCEIVE LOCAL

19:05 GOVERNMENT VERSUS THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT HERE IN THE UNITED

19:06 STATES. JONATHAN: WHAT IS A BIG DIFFERENCE

19:10 BETWEEN THE TWO CURRENTLY? MOHAMED: TRUST AND COMPETENCE.

19:17 AMERICANS HAVE VERY LOW TRUST AND CONFIDENCE IN THE NATIONAL

19:20 GOVERNMENT AND NATIONAL'S ASSERTIONS.

19:24 PERCEPTIONS OF CORRUPTION ARE HIGH PIER 1 IT COMES TO LOCAL

19:27 GOVERNMENT, PEOPLE HAVE A MUCH MORE POSITIVE -- PERCEPTIONS OF

19:30 CORRUPTION ARE HIGH. WHEN IT COMES TO LOCAL

19:36 GOVERNMENT, PEOPLE HAVE A MUCH MORE POSITIVE PERCEPTION.

19:38 AMERICANS LINE UP AT THE BALLOT BOX TODAY.

19:41 THEY ARE HEARING A LOT OF ECHO CHAMBER AND THE NATIONAL, WHAT

19:44 IT MEANS FOR 2024, BUT REALLY WHAT THEY WILL BE FOCUSING ON

19:49 OUR LOCAL ISSUES P THE NATIONAL CONVERSATION WILL INFORM THAT

19:51 PURE THAT IS WHY THINGS LIKE ABORTION, THINGS THAT INDICATE

19:56 -- ATTITUDES ABOUT BIG AND SMALL GOVERNMENT, FOR EXAMPLE,

19:57 THEY WILL BE DISCUSSED. THEY HAVE BEEN A FOCUS OF THE

20:01 CAMPAIGN. IN OHIO, THERE IS A REALLY BIG

20:03 PUSH ON ABORTION. IT WILL BE A REALLY IMPORTANT

20:09 WEATHERVANE WHETHER OR NOT ROE V.

20:13 WADE'S OVERTURNING, THE IMPACT OF THAT, HAS FADED OR IS STILL

20:15 WITH US. LISA: AS YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT LOCAL

20:19 ELECTIONS AND HOW DIFFERENT THEY ARE FROM THE NATIONALS,

20:23 THEY ARE PROBABLY NOT ON TIKTOK, LOCAL ELECTIONS, NOT ON

20:27 FACEBOOK AND HOW MUCH IS IT THE SOCIAL MEDIA ECHO CHAMBER THAT

20:29 POLARIZES PEOPLE AND GIVES THEM WORSE THAN EXCITED VIEWS OF

20:34 NATIONAL POLITICS IN A WAY THAT OGLE POLITICS MIGHT BE SLIGHTLY

20:35 IMMUNE? MOHAMED: I THING THAT IS A GREAT POINT.

20:41 IT IS MUCH EASIER TO CHECK THE BS, IF YOU WILL, ON A TOPIC OR

20:45 ISSUE IF THAT IS WHERE YOU LIVE. YOU KNOW THAT REALITY, YOU HAVE

20:51 DIRECT INFORMATION FROM PEOPLE YOU KNOW.

20:55 WHERE YOU LIVE, YOU CAN TALK TO YOUR NEIGHBORS, LOCAL RELIGIOUS

20:56 OR COMMUNITY LEADERS. WITH NATIONAL POLITICS, IT IS A

20:59 VERY DIFFERENT THING. IT TENDS TO HAVE NOW BECOME A

21:04 SORT OF WAR OF THE PROPAGANDAS OF BOTH PARTIES, WHERE TRUTH IS

21:08 VERY HARD TO IDENTIFY, BUT BOTH SIDES ARE ABSOLUTELY OUT THERE

21:12 TO RELIGIOUSLY CONVICT YOU -- EXCUSE ME, RELIGIOUSLY CONVERT

21:14 YOU TO THEIR WORLDVIEW. THAT IS CERTAINLY A FACTOR.

21:22 WHEN IT COMES TO 2024, EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE DONE

21:26 WITH REGARDS TO NATIONAL ELECTIONS REALLY COMES DOWN TO

21:28 ONE THING. AMERICANS FOCUS ON THE ECONOMY.

21:34 THE ECONOMY IS KING, QUEEN, AND BISHOP WHEN IT COMES TO PICKING

21:37 A PRESIDENT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES.

21:39 THAT WILL BE A HUGE FACTOR IN WHERE PEOPLE WILL PLACE THEIR

21:41 VOTES IN 2024. AS YOU ALL KNOW, WE ARE LIGHT

21:43 YEARS AHEAD FROM WHERE THAT IS IN TERMS OF ASSESSING WHERE THE

21:47 ECONOMY IS GOING TO BE THEN, AND THAT WILL BE THE MAJOR

21:48 FACTOR. WHEN IT COMES TO PARTY

21:54 ADVANTAGE, THE REPUBLICANS DEFINITELY HAVE MAINTAINED

21:55 THEIR HISTORIC ADVANTAGE IN TERMS OF AMERICANS VIEWING THEM

21:59 AS MORE COMPETENT AND KEEPING THE COUNTRY PROSPEROUS, THE

22:04 ECONOMY BOOMING, AND THE COUNTRY SAFE. LISA:

22:07 THAT SAID, HOW MUCH ARE YOU LOOKING TO GLENN YOUNGKIN TODAY?

22:17 THE LOCAL ISSUES HAVE GLOBAL -- WHETHER GLENN YOUNGKIN MIGHT BE

22:20 THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE. IS THAT A STRETCH? MOHAMED:

22:25 LOOKING AT THE POLLS NOW, THAT IS A STRETCH.

22:28 IT IS HARD TO ARGUE TRUMP IS NOT THE FRONT RUNNER OF THE

22:32 REPUBLICAN PARTY. EVERY POLL YOU DO -- WE DO NOT

22:36 DO TOO MANY POLITICAL POLLS THAT MUCH, BUT IT IS HARD TO

22:39 SEE SOMEONE JUMP ASTRONOMICALLY AHEAD OF HIM.

22:43 THAT BEING SAID, WE HAVE NOT HAD A PRESIDENT IN MODERN TIME

22:46 FACING THE LEGAL CHALLENGES HE IS FACING, AND THAT IS A WHOLE

22:49 OTHER SORT OF CURVEBALL BEING THROWN HERE.

22:51 IT IS NOT CLEAR WHAT HIS

22:58 SITUATION WILL BE COME RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD COME 2024.

23:05 WE HEARD FROM DAVID AXELROD ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE.

23:08 I WOULD NOT RULE OUT ANY SURPRISES OR SUDDEN DEPARTURES

23:09 ON EITHER SIDE. JONATHAN: JUST TO SQUEEZE THIS IN AND

23:17 FINISH WHERE WE STARTED, YOU MENTIONED THAT THE GOP HOLDS

23:19 ADVANTAGES ON CERTAIN ISSUES. WHICH ISSUES SPECIFICALLY?

23:22 MOHAMED: THERE ARE REALLY THREE ISSUES

23:27 -- ONE IS KEEPING THE COUNTRY PROSPEROUS AND REPUBLICANS HAVE

23:30 A PRETTY SIZABLE ADVANTAGE TO DEMOCRATS IN TERMS OF

23:35 PERCEPTIONS OF KEEPING THE COUNTRY PROSPEROUS.

23:37 THE OTHER ONE IS KEEPING THE COUNTRY SAFE.

23:41 AS YOU KNOW, WE ARE NOW VERY FOCUSED ON TWO PRETTY

23:43 SIGNIFICANT CONFLICT ACROSS THE WORLD.

23:46 HOPEFULLY, THAT DOES NOT BECOME A REALITY FOR US IN THE UNITED

23:47 STATES. AS AMERICANS FOCUS MORE ON

23:51 SECURITY ISSUES, REPUBLICANS HAVE THAT ADVANTAGE IN OUR

23:52 POLLS. THE FINAL ONE IS WHO IS MOST

23:55 COMPETENT TO HANDLE THE MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEM FACING THE

23:56 COUNTRY? WHAT IS FASCINATING ABOUT THAT

24:01 QUESTION IS THE MOST IMPORTANT OF HIM FACING THE COUNTRY, AS

24:04 I'VE SAID ON THIS SHOW MANY TIMES, RIGHT NOW IS POOR

24:05 LEADERSHIP AND GOVERNMENT. SO AMERICANS IDENTIFY THE

24:13 QUALITY, THE LOW POLITY OF NATIONAL LEADERSHIP AS THE MOST

24:14 IMPORTANT PROBLEM FACING THE COUNTRY.

24:19 SO IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PROBLEM, THE ECONOMY, AND

24:20 KEEPING THE COUNTRY SAFE. JONATHAN:

24:23 MOHAMED YOUNIS OF GALLUP. MOHAMED EL-ERIAN WRITES IN, "I

24:28 LIKE AMTRAK." THAT'S TWO PEOPLE. LISA:

24:46 JONATHAN: TAKING A BREAK ON THE S&P 500.

24:53 S&P FUTURES LOOKING LIKE THIS. AND NEGATIVE 5.25%.

24:58 WHAT A RUN WE HAVE SEEN. THE LONGEST DAILY WINNING

25:04 STREAK GOING BACK TO THE MIDDLE OF JUNE.

25:08 SEVEN ON THE NASDAQ 100. THAT IS THE LOWEST ON THAT

25:11 SINCE JANUARY. LISA: YIELDS ARE GOING LOWER.

25:17 WHEN THEY WENT HIGHER, THEY ALSO BENEFITED THE STOCKS.

25:23 YOU WONDER WHETHER THAT WILL BE THE BIG PERFORMER, IN

25:30 PERPETUITY. JONATHAN: THE DAILY MARKET MAP.

25:34 EVERY DAY, UP TO SAY UP OR DOWN. THAT IS THE PART OF THE GAME

25:40 THAT I HAVE A GREAT AMOUNT OF SYMPATHY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO

25:41 HAVE TO PLAY IT. EQUITIES CONTINUE TO RUN AT THE

25:46 FRONT END OF THE YIELD CURVE, DOUBLE DIGIT CURVE, YET WE

25:50 STILL SHRUGGED. LISA: IT IS ABOUT HOW FAR WE HAVE

25:54 COME. IF IT IS 4.61%, IT IS NOT A BIG

25:59 DEAL.

26:05 THE QUESTION IS, HOW MUCH DO WE NEED VOLATILITY TO COME DOWN?

26:12 IS IT THAT THE LEVELS HAVE TO KEEP GOING DOWN OR IS IT

26:19 STABILITY? JONATHAN:

26:20 HELP US DEFINE STABILITY. WE HAD A BIG MOVE OUT OF

26:25 NOWHERE AND THEN ANOTHER BIG MOVE YESTERDAY.

26:29 WE HAVE YIELDS COMING BACK DOWN FROM THE HIGHS, BUT TO BE HAVE

26:32 STABILITY? LISA:

26:38 IS IT CONSIDERING STABILITY? IF YOU KNOW THEY ARE GOING TO

26:45 BE TRADING IN A RANGE, IS THAT ENOUGH TO GIVE PEOPLE THE

26:46 CONFIDENCE?

26:53 IT'S BASICALLY, IF YOU ARE COUNTING ON THAT KIND OF MODEL,

26:57 IGNORE THE NOISE AND CALL IT A DAY.

27:07 IT'S -- JONATHAN: WHERE DO YOU THINK THE TEST IS ON THE CURVE?

27:13 LISA: TENDS 30'S. DID THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT DO

27:18 ENOUGH TO GIVE PEOPLE CONFIDENCE THAT THEY WERE NOT

27:21 SELLING MORE DEBT AND WOULD DESTROY THE CURVE DRAMATICALLY?

27:28 IF YOU SEE VERY ORDERLY AUCTIONS, COULD THAT

27:32 TURBOCHARGE RALLY INTO YEAR END? THERE IS A LOT TO CHEW ON.

27:38 JONATHAN: THAT WAS DREAMY STUFF. I HAVE NOT HEARD THAT FROM

27:42 ANYBODY. LEE; IT WAS A LITTLE BIT

27:46 SHOCKING.

27:52 EVERYONE HAS BEEN SAYING, WE ARE NOT GOING BACK TO THE

27:55 REGIME USED TO BE IN. OUR PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN THE

28:00 TRANSITORY STORY, HOWEVER MANY YEARS IT HAS BEEN DEBUNKED.

28:05 HERE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO HOOK INTO

28:09 HOW TO LEAD OFF THEIR COLUMNS. JONATHAN:

28:13 IT IS PRETTY TRANSITORY. THAT IS THE EXTENT OF MY

28:18 PHILOSOPHICAL WAYS. LET'S FINISH ON FOREIGN

28:22 EXCHANGE. EVERYTHING IS WEAKER AGAINST

28:27 THE DOLLAR YESTERDAY. IN THE FX MARKET, THAT DOLLAR

28:32 STRENGTH CONTINUES. LISA:

28:39 THE UNIT -- IT CANNOT GET AWAY FROM THIS.

28:44 THE EUROPEAN ECONOMY IS DOING A LOT WORSE THAN THE U.S. ECONOMY.

28:48 THAT HAS BEEN THE STORY AND CONTINUES TO BE THE STORY.

28:52 THERE IS NOTHING THAT WE ARE GETTING THAT PUSHES AGAINST

28:58 THAT. JONATHAN:

28:59 REDUCING EXPENSES THIS YEAR.

29:06 THE CREDIT SUISSE CAME IN AT $2 BILLION.

29:10 THE STOCK IS HIGHER BY 3.4%. LISA:

29:16 I'M LOOKING AT THE MONEY COMING IN, INCLUDING THE CREDIT SUISSE

29:19 UNIT. I WOULD LIKE AN UNDERSTANDING

29:21 OF WHAT THIS MONEY IS. IS IT CREDIT SUISSE CLIENTS

29:27 COMING IN AND NEWMAN A COMING INTO CREDIT SUISSE?

29:31 70 QUESTIONS AS WE HEAR FROM REALLY GOOD PEOPLE WHO HAVE YET

29:34 TO BE INTEGRATED.

29:40 THE INTEGRATION IS STILL VERY MUCH IN QUESTION.

29:42 YOU ARE SEEING THAT TODAY IN THE STOCK. JONATHAN:

29:48 LIFTING NEARLY $19 BILLION.

29:55 IT HAD ENTERED INTO A AGREEMENT. THE COMPANY HAD ONCE BEEN

30:01 VALUED IN 2019 AT 47 BILLION U.S. DOLLARS.

30:04 ADAM NEUMANN IS LONG GONE. LONG LIVE ADAM NEUMANN.

30:10 NOW IS THE TIME FOR US TO PULL THE FUTURE FORWARD BY

30:14 ADDRESSING AND IMPROVING OUR BALANCE SHEET.

30:16 WE ARE PULLING THE FUTURE FORWARD. LISA:

30:22 THERE IS A LOT ABOUT THE EUPHEMISMS AND THE SPIRITUAL

30:25 THE OF GOING TO THE OFFICE EVERY DAY.

30:28 THERE IS A QUESTION OF HOW MUCH OF AN ERA IT WAS THAT HAS BEEN

30:32 KILLED OFF BY THE PANDEMIC AND INFLATION.

30:37 ADAM NEUMANN IS THE POSTER CHILD , BUT REMEMBER THIS

30:42 COMPANY THAT SOLD $699 JUICERS THAT ATTACHED TO YOUR PHONE

30:46 WITH ALL THESE HIGHFALUTIN CONCEPTS?

30:54 THERE IS A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER THE HIGHFALUTIN

30:56 DISCUSSIONS ARE GETTING LOST IN THE REALITY OF COST OF MONEY

30:59 THAT IS SOMETHING RATHER THAN NOTHING.

31:06 JONATHAN: THINK ABOUT PELOTON. WE ARE GOING TO STRAP A TABLET

31:10 ON AN EXERCISE BIKE AND BUILD A COMMUNITY.

31:13 BECAUSE OF THE INTERNET, WE ARE GOING TO CONNECT LIFESTYLE AND

31:15 HEALTH CARE. IT WILL BE A KEY FEATURE OF

31:20 YOUR LIFE AS YOU LOOK TO STAY HEALTHIER. LISA:

31:28 I ACTUALLY ADMIRE PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT OF THE INTERNET AS

31:31 ELEVATING US AS HUMANS. IT IS THIS CONCEPT THAT IS

31:35 DIVORCED FROM THE BASENESS OF CAPITALISM.

31:45 IT IS SORT OF IN THE AREA AND IT SEEMS TO BE FADING.

31:51 JONATHAN: ON AVERAGE, PEOPLE LOSE 50 IQ

31:54 POINTS. I THINK THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS.

32:02 YOU LOSE 50 POINTS ACROSS THE BOARD, ON AVERAGE.

32:08 LISA: THEY HAVE MORE BUILDINGS. WHAT HAPPENS WITH THAT?

32:15 THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE LOSS OF THOSE IQ POINTS MIGHT BE A

32:17 PROBLEM. DO YOU FEEL SMART?

32:23 JONATHAN: I DO NOT KNOW IF I DO, BUT I

32:25 HOPE THEY DO. PREFERABLE TO DOING TOO LITTLE.

32:33 SAYING, I AM NOT READY TO SAY THAT WE ARE IN A GOOD PLACE.

32:41 JOINING US IN A HALF HOUR, LOOK OUT FOR THAT CONVERSATION.

32:46 WE WILL START A CONVERSATION THIS MORNING RIGHT THERE.

32:53 JENNIFER, D THINK WE TOOK IT AWAY FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE

32:56 LAST WEEK THAT LED TO THIS BIG ON MARKET?

33:00 FLEX IT IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE THE FED IS TRYING TO DEAL WITH

33:04 WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE MARKETS AT THE SAME TIME AS INFLUENCING

33:06 WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE MARKET. IT WAS A PRETTY CLEAR MESSAGE

33:14 AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR. BUT BY MAKING THOSE COMMENTS,

33:21 IT HAS CAUSED A BIT OF A REVERSAL. NOT TIDY ENOUGH.

33:31 LISA: DOES THAT SEEM REASONABLE TO

33:36 YOU?

33:36 >> NOT REALLY. I THINK THAT IS GOING THAT FAR.

33:40 I DO NOT THINK THE FED IS TRYING TO SUPPORT FINANCIAL

33:42 MARKETS MORE GENERALLY. AND AS AN INFLATION GOAL THAT

33:48 THEY NEED TO CONSIDER, PARTICULARLY THE STATE OF

33:51 FINANCIAL CONDITIONS. THERE IS SO MUCH UNCERTAINTY

33:58 ABOUT THE LENGTH AND HOW QUICKLY YOU WILL SEE THIS, BUT

34:04 WHAT WE KNOW IS THE INCREASING INTEREST RATES AND WHAT WE HAVE

34:09 SEEN IN THE U.S. -- IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED

34:16 WITHOUT A RECESSION FOLLOWING IT.

34:25 LISA: PEOPLE ARE THINKING MORE SURGICALLY ABOUT FED CUT.

34:36 RESPONDING TO WEAKNESS IN THE ECONOMY, RESPONDING SWEET AS IN

34:40 THE MARKETS AND BEING MORE ACCOMMODATIVE.

34:45 THERE ARE -- DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE BECOME WEAKER BECAUSE OF

34:46 LARGER SIGNS OF NEXT?

35:00 >> I THINK THAT BANKS HAVE NOT GENERALLY EXPERIENCE THIS FOR

35:04 DECADES. IT HAS BEEN AN EYE-OPENER ABOUT

35:06 HOW MUCH IT HAS VISIT.

35:12 I THINK THAT MEANS THAT THE BAR IS MUCH HIGHER.

35:19 THEY ARE GOING TO NEED CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT THEY ARE

35:22 LOOSENING BEFORE THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE CUTTING INTEREST

35:28 RATES. JONATHAN:

35:29 I THINK THERE IS SOME CONFUSION. THIS SIGNED SPECIFICALLY.

35:34 LIKELY TO WEAR ON ACTIVITY HIRING.

35:40 HOW FLUID IS AN ASSESSMENT LIKE THAT? IS IT ALREADY DATED?

35:49 WHAT IS THAT, IN YOUR VIEW?

35:53 >> IT IS A GOOD POINT. THE FED IS INFLUENCING MARKETS

36:00 AT THE SAME TIME, SO IT MEANS THESE COMMUNICATIONS BECOME

36:01 THAT DATED. A LOT OF THAT IS OVERLONG

36:12 TERMS. THE PACE AT WHICH BUSINESSES AND HOUSEHOLDS NEED

36:13 TO REFINANCE IS RELATIVELY SLOW. IT WILL INCREASE OVER THE

36:20 COMING MONTHS.

36:22 THEN WE WILL START TO SEE THE PREVIOUS INCREASES COMING

36:30 THROUGH. IT IS ABOUT AVERAGES AND THE

36:35 PACE OF WHICH THEY ARE PASSING THROUGH.

36:40 WE MUST BEAR IN MIND THESE AVERAGE RATES ARE VERY

36:41 IMPORTANT. JONATHAN:

36:47 IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE GONE THROUGH A REAL REBALANCING.

36:53 CAN WE TAKE SOME DATA AWAY FROM WHAT WE HAVE SEEN SO FAR?

36:57 WE ARE STILL DOING OK.

37:09 >> WAGE GROWTH IS COMING DOWN.

37:15 THERE IS NO SURGE IN MARKET. THIS IS A SOFT LANDING.

37:25 IT IS HOW THESE THINGS START.

37:35 IT SHOWS SOMETHING MORE WORRYING JONATHAN:

37:37 IT LOOKS LIKE A SOFT LANDING UNTIL IT DOES NOT.

37:43 LISA, TOP LINE FOR HIM. LISA:

37:50 THAT IS THE REASON WHY THE MIGHT HAVE'S -- WE MIGHT HAVE

37:54 HEARD A SHIFT IN TONE.

38:00 IT LOOKS LIKE A SOFT LANDING UNTIL IT IS NOT.

38:06 HOW DO YOU KNOW IT IS NOT JUST A NORMALIZATION VERSUS THE

38:13 BEGINNING OF A PROGRESSION INTO WEAKNESS.

38:28 JONATHAN: LOOK OUT FOR THAT CONVERSATION

38:30 AND THIS AS WELL. FOLLOWING THE LATEST NUMBERS.

38:38 WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM. SESSION LOWS, NEGATIVE BY 0.4%.

38:55 YIELDS UP BIG TIME. WE HAD DOWN THREE BASIS POINTS.

39:19 >> I THINK THAT IS VERY ENCOURAGING TO SEE.

39:26 IT IS INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THEY ARE RESPONDING AND TO

39:37 OFFER THEM THE BEST. SADLY, THEY NEED TO BE RESTRUCTURED

39:41 AND COMFORTABLE THAT WE CAN MITIGATE THE PAINFUL PART OF

39:49 THE JOB IT IS NECESSARY TO CREATE SOMETHING THAT IS

39:58 SUSTAINABLE.

39:59 JONATHAN: LET'S TURN TO THE S&P 500.

40:05 YIELDS I COMING DOWN THREE BASIS POINTS.

40:09 THIS IS QUITE A TURNAROUND.

40:15 YOU CAN POINT TO THE DATA, TREASURY FUNDING -- TAKE YOUR

40:16 PICK OF THE MOMENT.

40:22 LISA: THEY ARE NOT RESPONDING FROM

40:25 HERE BECAUSE WE HAVE ALREADY MOVED 40 BASIS POINTS.

40:28 AT THIS POINT, WE ARE LOOKING AT THE POTENTIAL VOLATILITY.

40:33 THE REFUNDING AGREEMENT IS WHAT HE DID OFF.

40:39 THERE ARE OTHER QUESTIONS. THE BANK OF JAPAN AND WHAT IS

40:46 GOING ON OVER THERE, INVESTORS GETTING A BETTER SENSE THAT WE

40:49 HAVE SEEN A PEAK. IT IS INCREDIBLY HIGH.

41:01 THAT IS MY -- JONATHAN:

41:07 YOU KNOW WHAT STANDS OUT?

41:24 LISA: THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT $100 A

41:25 BARREL OF OIL.

41:32 AT THIS POINT, WE DO NOT EVEN KNOW WHY.

41:37 IS IT A LACK OF DEMAND OR ARE THEY -- I WOULD HAVE A

41:40 DIFFICULT -- DIFFICULT TIME BELIEVING THE LATTER.

41:45 MAYBE DEMAND IS NOT COMING IN AS STRONG. JONATHAN:

41:53 THAT STOCK IS POSITIVE IN SWISS TRADING.

41:57 LET'S START WITH THE GOOD NEWS.

42:09 >> WE ARE GETTING STABILIZATION. I THINK THAT IS WHAT THEY WERE

42:11 LOOKING FOR FROM THIS SET OF NUMBERS.

42:15 THIS IS THE FIRST QUARTER THAT WE HAVE SEEN THEM BANG TOGETHER.

42:24 THE ANALYSTS DO NOT REALLY HAVE A HANDOFF FOR THEIR ESTIMATES.

42:30 YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING UNDER THE HOOD.

42:34 THAT IS GREAT NEWS.

42:40 AND GOT OVER ON A MORE EVEN KEEL.

42:46 WE ARE NOT GOING TO KNOW THAT UNTIL FEBRUARY WHEN WE GET

42:50 SERGIO UNVEILING THE PLAN STRATEGY.

42:56 THAT HE IS GOING TO DELIVER AT THIS BANK.

43:00 IT TELLS US THAT THEY ARE MAKING PROGRESS AND ARE ON

43:01 TRACK. TO BE HONEST, THAT IS BUYING

43:07 THE SHARES ARE RISING.

43:14 THINGS ARE RISING AND THEY ARE ON TRACK. LISA:

43:22 DO WE KNOW WHO THEY ARE KEEPING AND WHO THEY ARE NOT?

43:28 >> THIS IS ONE OF THE CRITICAL QUESTIONS.

43:33 500 MILLION IS BEING SET ASIDE FOR KEY STAFF, TO MAKE SURE

43:37 THOSE PEOPLE STICK AROUND.

43:44 THERE HAS BEEN THIS PERSON AND THAT PERSON LEAVING.

43:50 THEY NEED TO STABILIZE THAT.

43:56 THEY ARE PARKING MONEY TO MAKE SURE THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN.

44:02 IF THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE PROGRESS FROM STABILIZING THE

44:05 NUMBERS TO GROWING THE NUMBERS, THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

44:06 GOING TO DO THAT. THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY

44:10 UP TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. LISA:

44:17 A LOT OF CLIENTS WOULD PREVIOUSLY HAVE GONE TO CREDIT

44:21 SUISSE AND U.S. TO DIVERSIFY THEIR RISKS.

44:26 NOW THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE ALL THEIR FUNDS AND PUT THEM AT UBS.

44:31 WE HAVE A SENSE OF HOW MUCH THAT IS COMING TO THE FOR FOR

44:35 INSTITUTIONS IN THE REGION?

44:42 >> I DO NOT THINK WE ARE IN YET, BUT IT IS AN ISSUE.

44:52 THEY HAVE TO MANAGE THESE DIFFERENT POOLS, AND HOW THEY

44:56 MANAGE THAT PROCESS IS GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT.

45:07 PEOPLE WOULD SEE THEM AS COMPETITIVE.

45:14 I THINK IT IS UNCLEAR IF IT IS SMALLER, BUT MAYBE IT DOES, BUT

45:16 THEN IT GROWS.

45:24 ONE OF THE KEY QUESTIONS, CORPORATE AND WEALTH ARE ASKING

45:29 THEMSELVES, HOW DISTRACTED AND ARE THEY GOING TO BE?

45:46 AGAIN, WE GOT TO STABILIZATION BUT WHETHER OR NOT THAT MONEY

45:49 IS FIGURING OUT WHETHER HE NEEDS A BETTER DIVERSIFIER -- I

45:52 THINK THAT REMAINS UNRESOLVED. WE HAVE ONLY JUST STARTED THIS

45:54 PROCESS.

46:00 I DID NOT THINK THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS IN ANY WAY

46:02 CLEAR AT THIS POINT. JONATHAN:

46:09 AFTER THE EVENTS OF THE LAST NINE MONTHS, PARTICULARLY IN

46:10 THE U.S. BANKING, WE HAVE BEEN TALKING

46:14 ABOUT CONSOLIDATION. WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE AT THE

46:17 MOMENT?

46:24 >> I THINK IT LOOKS LIKE A LONG WAY OFF.

46:31 THE BANKING UNION -- WE HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR QUITE A

46:40 WHILE. WE ARE MILES AWAY FROM IT.

46:46 IT IS STILL A PATCHWORK OF BANKS, BANKING REGULATIONS, SO

46:49 I THINK IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT. THEY DO NOT HAVE CAPITAL

46:56 MARKETS THE WAY THE U.S. DOES.

47:02 A CONSOLIDATION PROCESS THAT IS DRIVEN BY A DESIRE TO CREATE

47:08 BIGGER, CROSS-BORDER BANKING WITHIN EUROPE IS A MUCH MORE

47:15 DIFFICULT PROCESS AND GOVERNMENTS DO NOT SEEM TO BE

47:16 ON BOARD WITH IT.

47:23 I SAYING WE ARE GOING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. JONATHAN:

47:26 THANK YOU. ENJOY ZURICH.

47:35 LISA: WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS

47:38 ON WHY YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SEE SOME KIND OF CONSOLIDATION

47:42 AFTER MARCH. HOW MUCH IS THIS FROM DIFFERENT

47:47 BANKS AND NOT WANTING TO DISRUPT THAT AND HOW MUCH OUR

47:53 REGULATORY HURDLES BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A LIGHTNING ROD FOR

47:55 DIFFERENT POLITICIANS. JONATHAN: IT HAD BEEN 54 MINUTES AND YOU

48:00 HAD NOT MENTIONED IT. LISA:

48:09 IF ANYTHING, IT WAS A LOT MORE POSITIVE AND SUDDENLY THEY DO

48:10 NOT MATTER AGAIN.

48:19 THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE CRISIS MOMENT.

48:24 SOMETHING WAS SUPPOSED TO BREAK, BUT IT DID NOT.

48:29 WE ARE NOT SEEING CONSOLIDATION OR STRUCTURE CHANGES.

48:33 WE HAD ADJUSTING THE BAND-AIDS OVER THE EDGES.

48:41 JONATHAN: SHORT TREASURIES. EVERY TIME WE BACKED AWAY, I

48:45 TURN AROUND AND SAY -- SHE WOULD STILL SAY, IS STILL SHORT.

48:56 RIGHT NOW, IS SHE STILL SHORT OF TREASURIES? LISA:

49:01 THAT IS THE QUESTION I WANT TO ASK HER AND IS THERE SOME TRADE

49:07 OR IS IT TOO NOISY TO FOLLOW THE KIND OF TRANS SHE IS KNOWN

49:10 FOR DOING? JONATHAN: EQUITY FUTURES ON THE S&P.

49:22 SIX DAYS OF GAINS. BONDS WITH A RALLY A BED.

49:42 >> THERE IS A LITTLE SHIFT UNDERWAY HERE THAT WE NEED TO

49:43 BE MINDFUL OF.

49:50 >> WE DO NOT THINK WE ARE GETTING ANY MORE RATE HIDES --

49:54 HIKES FROM THE FED.

50:02 JONATHAN: GOOD MORNING.

50:09 FROM OUR AUDIENCE WORLDWIDE, ALONGSIDE LISA ABRAMOWICZ, I AM

50:12 JONATHAN FERRO. GAMES, GAINS, GAINS.

50:22 SEVEN DAYS OF IT ON THE NASDAQ 100. LISA: A TONE SHIFT, YES.

50:32 EVERYONE EITHER ROLLS THEIR EYES OR LOOKS EXHAUSTED.

50:42 IT IS DIFFICULT TO COME UP WITH A NARRATIVE.

50:49 JONATHAN: THE FED IS DONE.

50:56 WE CAN DISCUSS SURGICAL RATE CUTS. I LOVE THE TWEETS.

51:04 CALL THEM WHATEVER YOU WANT. THIS ONE HERE.

51:07 SENSIBLE AS EXPECTING A RATE HIKE.

51:17 LISA: TALKING ABOUT A FED PUT BACK IN

51:18 PLAY.

51:31 WHEN I LOOK AT WHEN I AM LOOKING AT THESE COMPANIES,

51:33 THEY ARE PASSING THROUGH A LOT OF THE COST. WHEN YOU LOOK AT

51:40 ALL THESE BASIC THINGS, THEY ARE GETTING MORE EXPENSIVE AND

51:43 PEOPLE ARE STILL PAYING.

52:03 JONATHAN: THE FEDERAL RESERVE TALKED

52:07 ABOUT IT YESTERDAY.

52:10 IT IS NO GOOD TELLING PEOPLE THAT THE RATE OF PRICE CHANGE

52:12 IS LOWER THAN LAST YEAR. THEY ARE NOT GOING BACK.

52:21 LISA: IT IS THIS ECONOMICS LESSON

52:23 THAT IS NOT REALLY MAKING ITS WAY THROUGH THE SPHERE BECAUSE

52:27 PEOPLE ARE SEEING HOW MUCH MORE PRICES HAVE GONE UP.

52:38 THERE IS A KEY QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER WE ARE GOING TO REACH A

52:39 STASIS.

52:47 THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE ARE KEYING INTO AND COMPANIES ARE ABLE TO

52:49 KEEP SELLING. JONATHAN:

52:57 WE WILL CATCH UP AND ABOUT 27 MINUTES TIME.

53:00 ARE THERE REASONS FOR THE FED TO BE MORE TOLERANT OF USING

53:02 CONDITIONS? ISN'T THAT THE QUESTION RIGHT

53:05 NOW IN THIS MARKET?

53:12 LISA: MAYBE THEY ARE MORE COMFORTABLE

53:14 WITH IT. IT SEEMS TO BE THE THEME THAT

53:19 WE ARE HEARING FROM DIFFERENT INVESTORS. JONATHAN:

53:27 LESS THAN 30 MINUTES AWAY. EQUITY FUTURES ON THE S&P 500.

53:33 BOND MARKET RALLY THIS MORNING.

53:39 I CANNOT KEEP UP. YIELDS ARE LOWER BY A COUPLE

53:40 BASIS POINTS.

53:46 LISA: WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT NEEL

53:49 KASHKARI.

53:59 FED PRESIDENTS FROM, KANSAS CITY AND NEW YORK -- MAYBE THEY

54:05 CAN GIVE US MORE INSIGHT INTO WHETHER WE ARE SEEING SOME SORT

54:09 OF SOFTENING IN THE ECONOMY THAT JUSTIFIES USING OF

54:10 CONDITIONS. WE WILL GET HIS VIEW IN JUST A

54:14 LITTLE BIT.

54:20 THIS IS GOING TO BE AN INTERESTING KICKOFF TO THE

54:21 OPTIONS LATER IN THE WEEK. REALLY KEY TO SEE IF THE CALM

54:28 BENEATH THE SURFACE CONTINUES IN THE TREASURY MARKET AS THIS

54:35 IS TESTED AS TO HOW MUCH DEMAND THERE IS.

54:41 I AM FOCUSED ON VIRGINIA. IT COULD FLIP THE SENATE OF THE

54:45 STATE TO THE GOP. THERE WILL BE CALLS FOR HIM TO

54:50 RUN. THERE ARE SO MANY ARTICLES

54:57 PLEADING FOR HIM. IT GIVES YOU A SENSE OF HOW

55:01 POPULAR IT IS. JONATHAN:

55:08 I APPRECIATE THAT SARCASM.

55:18 LISA: IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT

55:20 HOW IT WILL CHANGE? I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO

55:22 WATCH THIS. JONATHAN:

55:30 JOINING US NOW, KATIE. IT IS THE NUMBER ONE QUESTION

55:33 FOR US. ARE YOU STILL SHORT ON TREASURIES? WHY?

55:43 >> IT IS ABOUT PERSISTENT TRENDS IN THE MARKET.

55:47 I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT SIGNALS HAVE BEEN SHORT FOR

55:50 NINE QUARTERS. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN MANY

55:56 DECADES THAT THIS HAS BEEN THE CASE. WE HAVE BEEN SAYING SHORT,

56:03 SHORT, SHORT ALL YEAR AND IT IS STARTING TO FEEL LIKE WE

56:07 ALREADY HAD IT COME THROUGH, SO WHAT IS NEXT?

56:14 YIELDS ARE AT INTERESTING LEVELS.

56:17 MAYBE WE HAVE FINALLY HIT THAT POINT.

56:23 I THINK THAT THE DATA HAS COME OUT TO SUPPORT INVESTORS, BUT I

56:29 ALSO THINK THAT A NARRATIVE THAT HAS MADE SINCE TO ME IS

56:35 INVESTORS HAVE WOKEN UP TO THE IDEA THAT 5% YIELDS, AT SOME

56:38 POINT THERE IS A BUYING POINT WHERE THIS COULD GO DOWN AND

56:44 NOW YOU START TO SEE THIS EQUILIBRIUM OCCUR, WHICH IS

56:48 SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR.

56:56 LISA: ARE YOU SEEING VALUE?

57:08 >> WE ARE SEEING CONSOLIDATION IN SIGNALS, SO THERE IS A

57:12 REDUCTION, BUT I WILL SAY THAT WE ARE SEEING MORE AND MORE

57:19 POSITIVE SIGNALS, SO ON THE SHORTER TERM, YOU WILL SEE MORE

57:23 POTENTIAL BUYING FOR TREASURIES, BUT I DO WANT TO

57:26 REMIND EVERYONE THAT INFLATION IS STILL AN ISSUE AND RATES CAN

57:30 BE HIGHER FOR LONGER. WE MIGHT SEE A LOT OF

57:36 VOLATILITY INSTEAD OF A NEW TREND EMERGING.

57:42 LISA: WHICH POINTS I GOING TO BE ACTION DRIVERS?

57:49 IS IT GOING TO BE EVERY INFLATION READ, OR DO YOU BUY

57:51 INTO THE IDEA THAT IT IS TREASURIES SUPPLY THAT HAS BEEN

57:55 DICTATING A LOT OF THE ANGST THAT WE HAVE FELT OVER THE LAST

57:56 MONTH?

58:04 >> HOW OFTEN DO PEOPLE ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT SUPPLY?

58:09 I THINK PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE EQUILIBRIUM OF WHAT YIELDS

58:15 SHOULD COST. FROM OUR SIDE, ON THE TECHNICAL SIDE, WHAT WE ARE

58:19 LOOKING FOR ARE POTENTIAL BREAKOUTS.

58:27 IT WILL DEPEND ON WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE ECONOMIC DATA AND IF

58:34 WE ACTUALLY SEE SOMETHING VERY EXTREME, WHERE WE SAW HIGHER

58:37 YIELDS AGAIN. IT SEEMS VERY UNLIKELY RIGHT

58:40 NOW, BUT IT IS A POINT TO START WATCHING EVERY DATA POINT TO

58:44 SEE WHICH DIRECTION YIELDS WILL GO. JONATHAN:

58:50 WE WILL CATCH UP WITH NEEL KASHKARI SOON.

58:56 THERE IS A SECOND PARAGRAPH IN THE STATEMENT THAT READS AS

58:57 FOLLOWS. TIGHTER FINANCIAL AND CREDIT

59:02 CONDITIONS ARE LIKELY TO WEIGH ON ACTIVITY HIRING AND

59:04 INFLATION. COULD YOU WRITE THAT SAME

59:08 SENTENCE TODAY AFTER THE MOVE WE HAVE SEEN?

59:12 WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS?

59:17 >> I THINK THESE NUMBERS COME IN DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES.

59:22 WE HAD A MASSIVE BUYING, BUT THIS COULD BE SOMEWHAT OF A

59:26 RELIEF RALLY, GIVEN HOW MUCH MOVEMENT WE HAVE SEEN DOWNWARDS.

59:34 LET'S BE HONEST. AT 5%, YIELDS STARTED TO GET EXCITING.

59:39 I THINK THERE IS -- THIS COULD BE THE TIP OF THE BEGINNING OF

59:43 UNDERSTANDING HAS AREAS FINANCIAL CONDITIONS HAVE

59:45 CHANGED. IF IT IS ENOUGH TO WARRANT A

59:48 POINT WHERE HE MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE CUTS AT SOME POINT,

59:53 EARLIER THAN SOME WOULD HAVE THOUGHT, LIKE MYSELF, WHO HAS

59:55 BEEN VERY PESSIMISTIC ABOUT RATE CUTS.

59:58 JONATHAN KLEIN DO YOU HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WOULD

01:00:03 LEAD TO THIS RATE CUTS?

01:00:06 >> WE WOULD HAVE TO SEE PRETTY SEVERE DETERIORATION TO SEE

01:00:08 RATE CUTS, GIVEN THE MANDATE OF THE FED AND THE FACT THAT THE

01:00:13 OTHER FACTORS THAT THEY ARE FOCUSED ON HAVE NOT COME DOWN

01:00:14 TO THEIR TARGET LEVEL. THE FACT THAT INFLATION IS

01:00:20 STICKY AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A STRONG WORKFORCE AND ALL

01:00:23 THESE CONDITIONS PUTTING US IN A GOOD PLACE, THEY HAVE BEEN

01:00:28 CLEAR THAT THEY ARE GOING TO KEEP US HIRED FOR LONGER.

01:00:33 IF WE HAD SOME SORT OF SEVERE DRAWDOWN OR DETERIORATION IN

01:00:38 CREDIT THAT WAS CLEARED, I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE TO ACT.

01:00:42 THAT WOULD BE A SITUATION WHERE WE WOULD SEE THOSE RATE CUT, IF

01:00:47 YOU SAW SOMETHING IN THE CREDIT MARKETS, IN TERMS OF CONSUMERS

01:00:48 STRUGGLING. LISA:

01:00:55 SO IT EXISTS, BUT AT A HIGHER PAIN POINT.

01:00:59 >> I THINK IT ALWAYS EXIST SOMEWHERE, BUT IT HAS MOVED A

01:01:02 LOT COMPARED TO WHAT WE LIKED IN 20 AND BEFORE. JONATHAN:

01:01:08 GIVEN YOUR UNCERTAINTY, WHY MAINTAIN THE SHORT?

01:01:13 WHY MAINTAIN THE SHORT WHEN IT CAN BE AS EXPENSIVE AS IT WAS

01:01:16 ON WEEKS LIKE LAST WEEK?

01:01:31 >> WE JUST NEED MORE DATA TO KNOW THE ANSWER.

01:01:37 OVER LONGER PERIODS OF TIME, THE MARKET IS GOOD AT GIVING US

01:01:41 INDICATIONS AND IT IS PARTICULARLY THESE SHORT-TERM

01:01:45 MOVEMENT WHERE YOU WANT TO LEAN ON YOUR OWN GUT, BUT YOU SHOULD

01:01:49 NOT BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT SYSTEMATIC TRADING IS ALL ABOUT.

01:01:57 IT LETS YOU TELL YOU -- IT TELLS YOU WHERE YOU ARE GOING.

01:02:07 JONATHAN: NEGATIVE BY .25%.

01:02:18 LET'S CALL IT FOR 62.8 -- 462 -- FOUR POINT -- 4.6287.

01:02:26 LISA: IT IS ALIVE, THE FRANKENSTEIN

01:02:29 OF ALL THINGS KILLED OFF OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS.

01:02:34 DOES HE LIKE THAT, OR IS IT COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO THE GOAL

01:02:35 OF THE FED?

01:02:44 JONATHAN: AT THE START OF THE YEAR, HE

01:02:49 PUT OUT A BLOG ABOUT THE THREE STAGES THAT HE SEES THE FEDERAL

01:02:53 RESERVE GOING THROUGH, STEP ONE, GETTING RATES UP QUICKLY,

01:02:58 STEP TWO, CONSIDERING WHETHER YOU HAVE TO DO MORE.

01:03:03 STEP THREE, THAT IS WHEN YOU HAVE CONVICTION.

01:03:04 IS IT GOING BACK TOWARDS TARGET? THAT WAS A REALLY GOOD GUIDE

01:03:09 THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. I WONDER IF WE ARE AT THAT

01:03:14 POINT WHERE WE ARE GETTING CLOSER TO STEP THREE.

01:03:22 LISA: WE ARE TRYING TO GET TO THE

01:03:27 NEXT ONE, SO IT WAS EASY TO SEE THE PAUSE AFTER THE HIKES.

01:03:31 IT IS HARDER TO SEE WHAT IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BREAK PAZ.

01:03:39 JONATHAN: THIS IS A MARKET THAT WANTS TO

01:03:41 TRADE TO A RECESSION WE HAVE NOT READ YET. LISA:

01:03:45 I AM NOT PROUD OF IT.

01:03:48 >> I AM IMMENSELY PROUD OF IT.

01:04:22 >> THE COURTS DURING THIS CASE MADE REFERENCES TO ASSETS THAT

01:04:26 WERE VERY VALUABLE. THIS IS A SCAM AND A CASE THAT

01:04:32 SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN BROUGHT. JONATHAN:

01:04:40 SPEAKING TO THE PRESS AFTER TESTIFYING IN HIS TRIAL.

01:04:47 LEADING JOE BIDEN AND FIVE KEY SWING STATES.

01:04:51 SHAPING UP AS FOLLOWS.

01:04:57 YIELDS ARE LOWER ON THE 10 YEAR. MOMENTS AWAY FROM A

01:05:05 CONVERSATION WITH NEEL KASHKARI. LISA:

01:05:16 DOES THIS SET THEM BACK? SUDDENLY, THE BOND MARKET IS

01:05:18 DOING NOTHING FOR THEM. IS IT FINE BECAUSE THE ECONOMIC

01:05:24 DATA IS SOFTENING TO THE POINT WHERE THEY ARE COMFORTABLE?

01:05:31 JONATHAN: ASKING THAT QUESTION THAT YOU

01:05:34 HAVE ALLUDED TO, WHETHER THEY CAN BE MORE TOLERANT.

01:05:40 THEY HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT EQUITIES AND FOREIGN EXCHANGES

01:05:47 AS WELL. LISA:

01:05:49 HERE IS THE CONUNDRUM THAT MANY ARE STRUGGLING WITH.

01:05:54 STOCK MARKET -- SMALLER COMPANIES ARE. DOING WELL.

01:05:58 AT WHAT POINT ARE THEY TAKING THEIR CUES FROM BUSINESS

01:06:00 LEADERS TELLING THEM THAT WE ARE REALLY STRUGGLING BETWEEN

01:06:05 HIGHER FINANCING COSTS AND SAYING, THINGS GET EASIER.

01:06:08 IT IS FINE. BUT OTHERS ARE DOING FANTASTICALLY.

01:06:15 YOU CAN GO ALL IN ON THE STOCK MARKET.

01:06:20 I THINK THAT IS THE COMPLEXITY THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TRYING

01:06:22 TO MAP THEIR HEADS AROUND.

01:06:28 JONATHAN: STOCKS ARE UP, LOOK AT THE S&P

01:06:32 500 AND SELECT NAMES. TAKE YOUR PICK AND ASKED THEM

01:06:35 HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT THIS ECONOMY.

01:06:47 LISA: IT RAISES THIS QUESTION OVER

01:06:51 WHETHER THEIR FATE IS BEING ACCURATELY REFLECTED IN THE

01:06:54 BROAD STOCK MARKET, THE S&P 500, SO I WONDER IF THE FED

01:06:58 WILL LISTEN MORE TO THAT THAN THE EQUITY MARKET.

01:07:06 THE FED PUT IS COMING BACK INTO PLAY BECAUSE THEY ARE

01:07:08 RESPONDING TO A DIFFERENT MARKET, HE ECONOMY THAT LOOKS

01:07:09 VERY DIFFERENT. JONATHAN: WE USED TO HAVE THESE PROBLEMS

01:07:16 IN THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS FOR A LONG TIME.

01:07:20 I CANNOT IMAGINE HOW MUCH MORE DIFFICULT IT IS. LISA:

01:07:25 I SPOKE TO A RESTAURANT OWNER FRIEND OF MINE AND THEY SAID

01:07:29 HOW MUCH THE COST OF FOOD HAS GONE UP.

01:07:34 THEY HAVE TO PAY THE HIGHER RENT .

01:07:37 IF BUSINESS FALLS OFF AT ALL, THEY HAVE NO SAFETY NET AND

01:07:39 CANNOT BORROW TO OFFSET THAT. THE RATES ARE TOO HIGH.

01:07:48 THIS IS THE RATE.

01:07:56 JONATHAN CLEMENT START DAY. IS IT A LOCAL ISSUE WHEN WE

01:08:00 FACE THESE LITTLE LATER?

01:08:05 >> ABSOLUTELY. WHAT YOU ARE SEEING AS PULLING

01:08:13 HAS RAMPED UP IS THAT TIME AND TIME AGAIN, THE ECONOMY RATES

01:08:18 NUMBER ONE AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE ECONOMY, EVEN THOUGH WE ARE

01:08:22 SEEING GOOD DATA, THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, AMERICANS ARE

01:08:26 STILL CONCERNED WITH INFLATION. GROCERY PRICES.

01:08:31 YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON AT RESTAURANTS AND THE

01:08:34 COST OF GOODS. EITHER A SINGLE PERSON, A

01:08:40 FAMILY OF FOUR -- EVERYONE IS FEELING HOW IMPORTANT IT IS.

01:08:44 IS THERE ANY SORT OF REFERENDUM AS TO WHAT IS GOING ON IN

01:08:50 WASHINGTON? BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF SINGLE

01:08:53 ISSUES THAT ARE ALSO BEING FOUGHT.

01:08:56 ABORTION IS ONE OF THEM IN OHIO. THERE IS AN INITIATIVE TO

01:09:02 ENSHRINE ABORTION INTO THE CONSTITUTION IN OHIO.

01:09:06 IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE THE RESULTS OF THIS AND WHAT

01:09:11 THEY CAN TELL US ABOUT NEXT YEAR'S GENERAL ELECTION. LISA:

01:09:15 HOW MUCH ARE YOU LOOKING AT THIS?

01:09:21 >> TERRY HAYNES SAYS IGNORE EVERYTHING BUT WHAT IS GOING ON

01:09:23 IN VIRGINIA BECAUSE WHAT

01:09:31 HAPPENS IN VIRGINIA MEANS -- THERE ARE A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS

01:09:33 AND WE HAVE SEEN REPORTED THAT DONORS ARE COZYING UP TO GLENN

01:09:38 YOUNGKIN AND ASKING HIM TO JUMP INTO THIS ELECTION, BUT HE HAS

01:09:43 THIS GOVERNORSHIP UNTIL 2026. DON'T -- DUE TO THE LAW IN

01:09:48 VIRGINIA, HE CANNOT RUN FOR CONSECUTIVE TERMS. IT GIVES HIM

01:09:53 THE PERFECT TIMING TO LAUNCH A 2028 PRESIDENTIAL RUN.

01:09:58 LET'S SEE WHAT THE RESULTS SHOW THIS EVENING.

01:10:05 HE HAS WORKED REALLY HARD WITH LOCAL LEGISLATURES TO MAKE SURE

01:10:09 THEY KEEP THAT HOUSE OF DELEGATES READ AND TO TRY TO

01:10:10 FLIP THE SENATE READ. IT SETS HIM UP NICELY FOR

01:10:15 WHATEVER PATH HE WANTS TO TAKE. LISA: HOW MUCH TIME IS THERE TO

01:10:22 CHANGE THE TICKET?

01:10:27 >> I DO NOT THINK THERE IS AN EXACT DEADLINE, BUT IT IS

01:10:29 GETTING VERY CLOSE. IF GLENN YOUNGKIN WERE TO JUMP

01:10:36 IN, HE WOULD NOT BE IN THE NEXT DEBATE IN MIAMI.

01:10:38 THAT IS TOMORROW. THERE IS SOME LEEWAY, BUT I

01:10:44 WOULD SAY BY THE END OF THE YEAR, IF HE WAS TO GET IN, SHE

01:10:47 WOULD NEED TO MAKE THAT DECISION ASAP.

01:10:54 FOR MANY PEOPLE IN D.C., IT FEELS TOO LATE, BUT OUTSIDE THE

01:10:57 BELTWAY, THEY SAY THERE IS STILL A PATH.

01:11:01 IT IS AN ODD ELECTION YEAR, TO SAY THE LEAST. A FORMER

01:11:05 PRESIDENT TESTIFYING AT A CIVIL TRIAL IN NEW YORK STATE.

01:11:11 THAT COULD BE THESE BLACK SWAN MOMENTS. JONATHAN:

01:11:15 YET HE IS A CANDIDATE FOR THE PARTY.

01:11:20 PEOPLE ARE STILL QUESTIONING WHETHER HE WILL RUN AT ALL.

01:11:23 WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT HIS PROSPECTS OF WINNING?

01:11:28 >> IT WILL COME DOWN TO THESE KEY SWING STATES.

01:11:35 MAYBE THEY SAW OUR POLLS SHOWING THAT HE IS WINNING IN

01:11:40 KEY STATES. THERE IS ONE CAVEAT IN THAT NEW

01:11:47 YORK TIMES POLL, THE FACT THAT THESE VOTERS SAY IF TRUMP IS

01:11:50 CONVICTED ON THE JANUARY 6 RELATED TRIAL IN D.C., THEY

01:11:56 WOULD SWITCH THEIR VOTE TO PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN, EVEN

01:11:59 THOUGH MANY BELIEVE THE CURRENT PRESIDENT IS JUST TOO OLD, THEY

01:12:07 ARE NOT FEELING THE EFFECTS OF BIDENOMICS.

01:12:12 HE WAS TALKING ABOUT AMTRAK YESTERDAY, BUT THE FACT OF THE

01:12:16 MATTER IS, IF THERE IS A CONVICTION, IT WILL CHANGE THE

01:12:17 POLL NUMBERS VERY QUICKLY.

01:12:23 JONATHAN: WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

01:12:26 >> IT IS NOT PULLING WELL. THERE WAS A POST WHERE WHAT YOU

01:12:34 SAW WAS THE MAJORITY OF INDIVIDUALS COULD NOT EXPLAIN

01:12:36 WHAT IT MEANT. THEY COULD NOT EXPLAIN PARTS OF

01:12:40 THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT THAT THEY LIKE TO TELL.

01:12:45 WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT BUT I DID NOT THEY POINT TO THREE KEY

01:12:48 LEGISLATIONS. WHAT USED TO BE A JOKE UNDER

01:12:54 THE FORMER PRESIDENT. THIS IS WHY BIDEN WAS TOUTING

01:13:00 IT , I ACTUALLY GOT IT DONE. WHY ARE RAILROADS IN AMERICA

01:13:05 NOT AS GOOD OR UP TO SPEED AS THOSE SEEN AROUND THE WORLD?

01:13:15 THEN THEY WILL POINT TO THE REDUCTION ACT.

01:13:20 TAX CREDITS FOR EV'S. WHEN YOU HAVE INFLATION EATING

01:13:26 AWAY AT FAMILY PAYCHECKS, THIS KIND OF STUFF IS NOT LANDING.

01:13:29 JONATHAN: THANK YOU. THEY ARE GREAT.

01:13:33 THEY ARE PRETTY DECENT, AREN'T THEY?

01:13:40 LISA: I LOVE TRAINS. I WANT TO LOVE AMTRAK.

01:13:47 JONATHAN: IT IS GOING TO LEAVE PERFECTLY

01:13:48 ON TIME.

01:14:06 JONATHAN: A6 DAY WINNING STREAK COULD BE

01:14:07 COMING TO A CLOSE. EQUITY FUTURES ARE SLIGHTLY

01:14:12 NEGATIVE. SEVEN DAYS ON THE NASDAQ.

01:14:17 A SEVEN DAY WINNING STREAK ON THE NASDAQ.

01:14:20 DOWN TO 0.1% ON THE SESSION SO FAR. 10 YEAR, 10 YEAR, 30 YEAR.

01:14:28 YIELDS ARE AGGRESSIVELY LOWER LAST WEEK.

01:14:32 A LITTLE BIT HIGHER LAST WEEK. LISA:

01:14:35 THAT IS BASICALLY NO MOTION WHATSOEVER.

01:14:40 MAYBE WE WILL GET A NEW TONE OR NARRATIVE THAT WE CAN LEAD INTO.

01:14:47 JONATHAN: FROM 47 BILLION DOLLARS TO

01:14:48 BANKRUPTCY, WE WORK. WE MENTIONED THIS 90 MINUTES

01:14:51 AGO. IS IT ADAM NEUMANN FOR ADAM NEUMANN?

01:14:58 LISA: HE REALLY DOES TAKE THE CAKE

01:15:02 WHEN IT COMES TO HAVING A PHILOSOPHY WHERE THE NUTS AND

01:15:04 BOLTS ARE GETTING 10 TO 20 YEAR LEASES FOR PROPERTIES 700 TO 50

01:15:09 BUILDINGS AND RENTING IT OUT BY THE MONTH, AND SUDDENLY THE

01:15:11 MARKET COLLAPSES. THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE SEEING

01:15:14 TODAY.

01:15:22 THEY HAVE ASSET OF ABOUT $16 BILLION. JONATHAN:

01:15:30 THIS MORNING

01:15:37 -- >> WE ARE PLEASED TO BRING -- TO HAVE NEEL KASHKARI AT THE

01:15:39 TABLE TODAY. ONLY FOR US, I'M SURE.

01:15:47 NOTHING ELSE THIS MORNING, EXCEPT FOR BLOOMBERG

01:15:48 SURVEILLANCE.

01:15:54 YOU ARE KNOWN AS THE GUY WHO IS THE MOST HAWKISH.

01:16:03 YOU HAVE LEFT OPEN THE OPTION OF DOING MORE.

01:16:08 HOW MUCH MORE DO YOU THINK THE ECONOMY MIGHT NEED?

01:16:13 ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THE DOT PLOT FROM SEPTEMBER?

01:16:17 IF YOU HAVE TO START RAISING AGAIN, DO YOU HAVE TO GO

01:16:18 FURTHER?

01:16:21 >> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.

01:16:28 I WISH I COULD GIVE THAT CERTAINTY.

01:16:30 THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH THAT IS UNUSUAL.

01:16:35 HOW LONG IT HAS TAKEN IN THE

01:16:41 DYNAMICS AS THE PROCESS HAS HAPPENED.

01:16:44 WE HAVE TO LET THEM GUIDE US JUST TO POINT OUT THE OBVIOUS,

01:16:46 OUR FORECAST HAS NOT BEEN GREAT. WE ARE ALL COMMITTED.

01:16:54 EVERYONE IS COMMITTED AND WE HAVE TO GET INFLATION BACK TO

01:16:59 2% OVER A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME. I JUST DO NOT KNOW.

01:17:07 >> AT WHAT POINT WOULD YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE TIGHTENED

01:17:10 ENOUGH OR NOT TIGHTENED ENOUGH? WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

01:17:19 >> IT IS RUNNING AT ABOUT 2.5% AND IT IS LOWER THAN THE ONE

01:17:20 YEAR DATA. THAT SUGGESTS THAT THE

01:17:24 DISINFLATION IS REAL. IF WE CONTINUE TO SEE NUMBERS

01:17:30 OF THAT RANGE OR LOWER, THAT WOULD TELL ME THAT WE ARE NOW

01:17:36 ON A PATH BACK TO 2% INFLATION. BUT IF WE START TO SEE THAT

01:17:40 TICKING BACK UP AGAIN, THAT WOULD TELL ME THAT OUR JOB IS

01:17:43 NOT YET DONE AGAIN.

01:17:51 >> A COUPLE OF TENTHS HIGHER? OR DOES IT HAVE TO BE A

01:17:56 SIGNIFICANT MOVE? WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT FOR

01:17:58 SEPTEMBER? -- FOR DECEMBER?

01:18:08 >> WE HAVE BEEN BY HOW STRONG CONSUMERS HAVE BEEN.

01:18:10 THEY HAVE HELD UP REMARKABLY WELL.

01:18:16 WHEN ACTIVITY CONTINUES TO RUN THIS HIGH, THAT MAKES ME

01:18:21 QUESTION, IS POLICY AS TIGHT? CONTINUED STRONG ECONOMIC

01:18:28 ACTIVITY ON THE REAL SIDE, THAT WOULD TELL ME, OK, WE MIGHT

01:18:30 NEED TO DO MORE. IT IS HARD FOR ME TO SAY, THIS

01:18:34 DATA POINT NEEDS TO BE HERE. JONATHAN:

01:18:41 HAVE WE OUTSOURCED DOING MORE TO FINANCIAL MARKET?

01:18:47 >> THIS IS A COMPLICATED QUESTION.

01:18:50 SOME PEOPLE TO POINT TO TERM PREMIUM. I ALWAYS JOKE IT IS THE

01:18:55 RESIDUAL OF ALL THE STUFF THAT WE CANNOT EXPLAIN.

01:18:58 IT IS THAT DARK MATTER IS OUT THERE.

01:19:02 SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT IS DRIVEN BY PHYSICAL.

01:19:07 IF IT WAS SCHOOL, I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED TO SEE A WEAK DOLLAR.

01:19:14 USUALLY, THEIR CURRENCY WEEKENDS, BUT OURS HAS BEEN

01:19:15 STRONG. ANOTHER POSSIBILITY IS THE PATH

01:19:20 OF POLICY OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS.

01:19:23 THAT COULD EXPLAIN THE STRONGER DOLLAR AND A WEAKER STOCK

01:19:25 MARKET GOING INTO THE LAST MEETING.

01:19:30 MAYBE IT IS A COMBINATION OF ALL THREE OF THESE.

01:19:34 THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE ARE SPENDING A LOT OF TIME TRYING

01:19:35 TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE MARKETS ARE DOING.

01:19:39 I'M NOT COMFORTABLE SAYING WHICH OF THOSE THREE IT IS

01:19:44 BECAUSE IT DETERMINES WHAT IT MEANS FOR POLICY.

01:19:51 IF IT IS THE NEUTRAL RATE OR IF IT IS THE FORMER GUIDANCE OF

01:19:53 THE PATH OF POLICY, WE WOULD HAVE TO FOLLOW THROUGH TO

01:19:55 PRESERVE THOSE RATES.

01:20:04 JONATHAN: WHERE IS THAT COMING FROM?

01:20:08 >> THAT HAS BEEN IN THERE FOR A LONG TIME.

01:20:13 IT HAS LED TO SOME TIGHTENING OF CREDIT CONDITIONS ACROSS THE

01:20:15 ECONOMY, SO I THINK THAT IS RIGHT.

01:20:23 JONATHAN: CANNOT CHANGE MEETING TO

01:20:24 MEETING? SOME OF THOSE COMMENTS HAVE

01:20:29 INSPIRED MOVEMENT OVER THE LAST WEEK.

01:20:36 >> WE ALWAYS HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF PUTTING THINGS INTO THE

01:20:37 STATEMENT. AS SOON AS YOU TAKE SOMETHING

01:20:43 ELSE, ALL OF A SUDDEN, PEOPLE SAY, THEY ARE DECLARING THAT

01:20:45 ALL OF THE BANKING STRESSES ARE OVER.

01:20:49 I WOULD LOOK AT ALL THE RANGE OF COMMENTARY THAT YOU GET.

01:20:53 LOOK AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE TO GET A BEAD OF THE THOUGHTS.

01:21:01 LISA: PEOPLE DO NOT WANT JUST CERTAINTY.

01:21:04 THEY WANT A GUIDING PHILOSOPHY. DO YOU THINK FED CHAIR POWELL

01:21:08 HAS SOME KIND OF PHILOSOPHY ON WHERE THE BAR IS TO CUT RATES

01:21:11 AND HOW TO RAISE THEM FURTHER?

01:21:17 >> WE ARE COMMITTED TO GETTING BACK TO 2% INFLATION.

01:21:20 THERE HAS BEEN CHATTER THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD RAISE THE

01:21:24 TARGET. WE ARE GOING TO GET INFLATION

01:21:27 BACK TO 2% AND WE ARE GOING TO LET THE DATA GUIDE US.

01:21:33 WE HAVE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS ON INFLATION AND WE ARE NOT

01:21:34 DONE YET. IF WE NEED TO DO MORE, WE WILL.

01:21:42 LISA: THE FIVE TO CUT RATES HAS BEEN

01:21:45 LOWERED. SUDDENLY, NOT ONLY ARE WE

01:21:50 REACHING A PAUSE, BUT ALSO, THE FED WILL CUT YEAR, MAYBE HE

01:21:54 SURGICALLY. DO YOU WANT TO PUSH BACK

01:21:57 AGAINST THAT? DO YOU THINK THE BAR TO CUT IS

01:22:00 AS HIGH AS IT WAS?

01:22:08 >> THERE IS NO DISCUSSION AMONGST ME AND MY COLLIES ABOUT

01:22:10 WHEN WE ARE GOING TO START CUTTING ME.

01:22:15 AT SOME POINT, WHEN INFLATION IS ON ITS WAY BACK DOWN, IF WE

01:22:18 DID NOT BACK OFF A LITTLE BIT, WE'LL RATES WOULD BE GETTING

01:22:22 TIGHTER AND TIGHTER, BUT THAT IS MASS. LISA:

01:22:27 IS THERE WEAKNESS IN THE ECONOMY?

01:22:33 >> LOOK AT THE PRINT. FOR THE LAST 12 MONTHS, GDP HAS

01:22:36 BEEN VERY STRONG. UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS TICKED

01:22:44 UP, BUT WE HAVE ALSO SEEN A HUGE SURGE, WHICH IS REALLY

01:22:46 POSITIVE, COME ONLINE. I AM SEEING CONSUMERS THAT ARE

01:22:50 REALLY STRONG. MY AIRPLANE WAS 100% FULL

01:22:53 YESTERDAY. IT WILL BE 100% FULL TODAY.

01:23:05 >> YOU ARE ON BOARD FOR LONGER, SO YOU MUST HAVE MODELED OUT

01:23:09 SOME IDEA OF HOW LONG YOU WOULD NEED TO LEAVE RATES UNCHANGED

01:23:12 BEFORE YOU COULD GET DOWN TO A LEVEL LOW ENOUGH THAT YOU COULD

01:23:14 TAKE YOUR FOOT OFF OF THE BREAK A LITTLE BIT.

01:23:21 HOW LONG DO YOU THINK YOU WILL BE AT 5.5, INTO 2024?

01:23:28 >> IT DEPENDS.

01:23:34 IF WE END UP WITH TWO .5% CORE INFLATION AND IT CONTINUES TO

01:23:39 TREND DOWN, THAT WOULD GIVE ME EVIDENCE TO SAY, WE SHOULD LOOK

01:23:43 AT BACKING OFF, SO THE REAL POLICY IS NOT GETTING TIGHTER

01:23:44 AND TIGHTER.

01:23:50 BUT I DO NOT WANT TO POINT TO ONE DATA SERIES.

01:23:59 >> YOU TALK TO BUSINESSES IN YOUR DISTRICT ALL THE TIME.

01:24:03 WHAT ARE THEY TELLING YOU ABOUT YOUR GROWTH, HIRING AND

01:24:05 PRICING, GOING FORWARD?

01:24:07 >> IT IS MODERATING. PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY IN THE

01:24:12 DAKOTAS HAVE A HARD TIME FINDING WORKERS, BUT IN

01:24:18 MINNESOTA, IT IS A TIGHT LABOR MARKET BUT NOT AS TIGHT AS IT

01:24:19 WAS A YEAR AGO. IT MAPS TO THE DATA THAT WE

01:24:25 WERE SEEING BUT ONE THAT IS STILL VERY WARM.

01:24:32 DEPENDING ON THE SECTOR, THEY ARE SAYING, WE FEEL PRETTY GOOD

01:24:36 ABOUT THINGS. OBVIOUSLY, THEY READ THE NEWS.

01:24:42 THERE IS A LOT OF ECONOMIC ANXIETY THAT PEOPLE FACTOR THAT

01:24:44 INTO THEIR OWN BUSINESS PLANNING. THE OUTLOOK IS STILL

01:24:49 OPTIMISTIC, BUT IT IS CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC.

01:24:55 IT IS FUNNY BECAUSE THEY STILL HAVE SOME PRICING POWER, MORE

01:25:00 THAN THEY HAD DURING THE PANDEMIC, BUT NOT AS MUCH AS

01:25:02 THEY HAD SIX MONTHS OR A YEAR AGO. JONATHAN:

01:25:08 CAN WE FINISH ON HIKING? IS THAT DUTCH HOUSING?

01:25:11 IS THE HOUSING MARKET BROKEN? CLOSELY AND STRUCTURALLY UNDER

01:25:17 BUILT THE NUMBER OF UNITS THAT WE NEED.

01:25:24 THAT IS ABOUT REGULATION, CREATING MORE SUPPLY COMING IN.

01:25:28 IT WILL SETTLE OUT, OVER TIME, BUT STRUCTURALLY, WE HAVE TO

01:25:29 BRING MORE SUPPLY ONLINE. JONATHAN:

01:25:34 IT COULD BE 20 TO 30 YEARS. THE LEGACY COULD BE A

01:25:39 GENERATION OF PEOPLE KNOCKED OUT OF THE HOUSING MARKET.

01:25:42 THERE COULD BE A GENERATION OF PEOPLE WHO NEVER SELL THEIR

01:25:44 HOME.

01:25:47 >> PEOPLE IN NEEDING TO MOVE. AND PEOPLE DO NOT SELL THEIR

01:25:51 HOME BECAUSE THEY ARE LOCKED INTO A LOW MORTGAGE, THAT IS

01:25:56 LESS SUPPLY, BUT ALSO ONE LESS BUYER.

01:25:59 THAT AFFECTS BOTH THE SUPPLY SIDE AND THE DEMAND SIDE OF THE

01:26:05 HOUSING MARKET. JONATHAN:

01:26:07 I AM RENTING AND CANNOT BUY, SO I AM NOT SELLING ANYTHING.

01:26:12 THAT IS THE GENERATION I'M TALKING ABOUT.

01:26:14 ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT COULD BE THE LEGACY?

01:26:19 >> THE LEGACY IS THAT WE HAVE DEALT WITH THE PANDEMIC VERY

01:26:20 AGGRESSIVELY. WE WERE SURPRISED BY HIGH

01:26:23 INFLATION AND THEN WE MOVED AGGRESSIVELY TO BRING IT BACK

01:26:28 DOWN.

01:26:30 >> I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT ALL THE FINANCIAL CEOS IN HONG KONG.

01:26:37 VERY DOWN ABOUT THE PROSPECTS FOR THE ECONOMY.

01:26:42 THEY SUGGEST THAT THINGS ARE PRETTY FRAGILE IN THE ECONOMY

01:26:46 AND THE MARKETS, GIVEN EVERYTHING GOING ON AROUND THE

01:26:48 WORLD. HOW WORRIED ARE YOU?

01:26:59 >> WE HAVE TEAMS OF PEOPLE LOOKING AT SCENARIOS AROUND THE

01:27:00 WORLD. GEOPOLITICS, WHEN THOMAS ATTACKED ISRAEL, THE FIRST

01:27:08 THING THAT WE THOUGHT OF WAS, WHAT IS IT GOING TO DO TO

01:27:11 COMMODITY PRICES? THE RESPONSE HAS BEEN MUTED.

01:27:17 THE BROADER GEOPOLITICAL ISSUES ARE SO FAR OUTSIDE OUR BOUNDS

01:27:24 OF FORECASTING AND WE ARE TRYING TO FORECAST WHERE

01:27:25 GEOPOLITICS IS GOING. WE JUST HAVE TO FOCUS ON WHAT

01:27:28 WE CAN CONTROL. LISA: THIS IS WHY TRYING TO GET IT

01:27:35 RIGHT IS IMPOSSIBLE. I'M JUST SAYING, PEOPLE ARE

01:27:37 TALKING ABOUT THAT NOW.

01:27:43 JONATHAN: ALWAYS A PLEASURE.

01:27:49 ALONGSIDE MIKE MCKEE, WE WILL PICK UP ON SOME OF THE COMMENTS

01:27:54 AND CATCH UP ON THE DATA. EQUITY FUTURES PULLING BACK

01:28:01 JUST A TOUCH, FOLLOWING A SIX DAY WINNING STREAK.

01:28:05 SEVEN DAYS ON THE NASDAQ 100. THE LONGEST GOING BACK TO

01:28:09 JANUARY. WE HAD A GAIN OF OVER 7%.

01:28:16 WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT. IT YIELDS ARE LOWER BY A SINGLE

01:28:17 BASIS POINT. FROM NEW YORK CITY THIS

01:28:22 MORNING, GOOD MORNING.

01:28:36 >> WE HAVE TO LET THE INFLATION DATA GUIDE US JUST TO POINT OUT

01:28:41 THE OBVIOUS, OUR FORECAST HAS NOT BEEN GREAT.

01:28:45 WE ARE ALL COMMITTED. EVERYONE IS COMMITTED THAT 2%

01:28:51 IS OUR INFLATION TARGET. WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO A

01:28:56 REASONABLE TIME. I JUST DO NOT KNOW.

01:29:05 JONATHAN: THIS CONVERSATION WILL CONTINUE.

01:29:09 LOOKING AT SOME OF THE SCORES. A TOUCH NEGATIVE.

01:29:15 YIELDS A TOUCH LOWER. THE DOLLAR IS A LITTLE STRONGER

01:29:19 ON THE EURO.

01:29:27 LISA: THE STRENGTH KIND OF RAISING

01:29:30 DOUBTS ABOUT THE STORY THAT THE YIELD INCREASE WAS REALLY DO TO

01:29:36 THE INCREASE IN THE DEFICITS, INCREASE IN ANXIETY AROUND THE

01:29:38 U.S. POLITICAL SYSTEM. THE FACT THAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN

01:29:45 A WEAKENING QUESTIONS WHETHER THIS IS A SUPPLY DRIVEN STORY.

01:29:51 THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE BIG CONUNDRUMS. JONATHAN:

01:29:57 THEY CANNOT TALK ABOUT RATE CUTS OR IMPLY THAT THEY ARE

01:29:58 TALKING ABOUT RATE CUTS. GOOD MORNING.

01:30:08 LET'S GO STRAIGHT THERE BECAUSE I HAD MESSAGES FROM YOU.

01:30:13 WE ARE A LONG WAY FROM NEUTRAL. WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING ON?

01:30:17 WHERE DO YOU THINK THIS IS GOING?

01:30:20 >> I THINK I AGREE THAT IT DOES NOT PAY MUCH TO FORECAST RIGHT

01:30:26 NOW. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE DATA AS

01:30:30 IT IS COMING FOR YOU.

01:30:36 THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS UP ABOVE THE FED'S FORECAST FOR

01:30:38 THIS YEAR. THAT IS THE FIRST TIME IT HAS

01:30:41 HAPPENED SINCE MARCH 2022. WHEN YOU ARE IN THE THICK OF

01:30:46 IT, IT IS HARD TO KNOW WHETHER THAT REPRESENTS THE START OF

01:30:51 SOMETHING MUCH MORE ONEROUS OR IF IT IS A NORMALIZATION OF THE

01:30:57 LABOR MARKET, BUT I THINK FOR

01:31:03 THE FED, I THINK THE DOVE IS ON THE -- PRESIDENT KASHKARI TENDS

01:31:06 TO LEAD ON THE HAWKISH SIDE OF THE CONSENSUS.

01:31:10 FOR THE DOVES, THEY HAVE ALL THE MISSION.

01:31:14 THEY NEED TO BASICALLY PUT THE HOCKS IN A CASKET.

01:31:16 I THINK THAT IS THE WAY I WOULD THINK ABOUT IT.

01:31:23 YOU CAN POINT THE PICKUP AND YOU CAN POINT TO WHAT POWELL

01:31:24 HAS SAID. WHEN CENTRAL BANKERS SAY

01:31:30 PROCEED CAREFULLY, RISK MANAGEMENT, THAT IS CODE FOR

01:31:37 DOING NOTHING.

01:31:39 FINALLY, THE EMPLOYMENT REPORT WAS PROBABLY UNDERSTATING

01:31:42 PAYROLL GROWTH. THERE WAS A LOT OF STRIKE

01:31:49 ACTIVITY, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, OUR EARNINGS ARE RUNNING

01:31:52 JUST OVER 3% OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS.

01:31:56 I DO NOT THINK THE HOCKS CAN USE THE LABOR MARKET AS A

01:31:59 RATIONALE TO BE HAWKISH ANYMORE. THAT IS OVER.

01:32:03 I THINK THEY CAN SAY THAT THE LABOR MARKETS HAVE BEEN

01:32:09 REBALANCED. IF THEY CAN SAY THAT IMPLICITLY, IT MEANS THE DOOR

01:32:14 IS A LITTLE BIT CRACKED OPEN FOR A CUT.

01:32:19 IT WOULD NOT BE THE FIRST TIME THAT HE BASICALLY FLIPPED ON A

01:32:25 DIME. WE'RE A LONG WAY FROM NEUTRAL.

01:32:29 WE ARE NOT EVEN THINKING ABOUT TAPERING OR HIKING.

01:32:34 TO ME, THE FACT THAT THEY ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT IT IS

01:32:36 IRRELEVANT.

01:32:42 IT IS ALL IN THERE FOR NEXT YEAR. JONATHAN:

01:32:46 WHAT ARE SURGICAL CUTS?

01:32:50 >> THEY ARE CUTS TO STABILIZE THE ECONOMY.

01:32:57 THE ISSUE IS, THE EXTENT TO WHICH CUTTING QUICKLY

01:33:01 TRANSLATES INTO RAPID ECONOMIC STABILIZATION.

01:33:06 AS AN EXAMPLE, LET'S SAY WHAT HAPPENS WITH PURCHASE DEMAND.

01:33:09 WE HAVE SEEN MORTGAGE RATES COMING DOWN TO 7%.

01:33:15 LISA: YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT WAY MORE

01:33:19 ECONOMIC STRENGTH THAN PEOPLE HAD EXPECTED AND NOW YOU ARE

01:33:23 TALKING ABOUT SURGICAL CUTS TO STABILIZE THE ECONOMY.

01:33:26 I YOU SAYING THEY ARE WARRANTED? >> PART OF THE TENSION IS THAT

01:33:33 MY JOB IS NOT TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT I THINK THE FED SHOULD DO.

01:33:37 MY JOB IS TO GET INTO THEIR HEAD AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY

01:33:41 WILL DO. I WOULD PROBABLY BE MORE

01:33:43 HAWKISH THAN THE CONSENSUS, BUT I AM NOT THERE.

01:33:47 >> DO YOU THINK THE CONSEQUENCE OF SURGICAL CUT TO FORTIFY THE

01:33:50 ECONOMY WILL BE PROLONGED INFLATION?

01:33:55 HOW DO YOU ARRANGE AROUND THAT? HOW DO YOU LEAN INTO THE RALLY

01:34:01 THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE BOND MARKET AND SAY, WAIT A SECOND,

01:34:06 YOU HAVE GOTTEN AHEAD, BASED ON THE GAME THEORY THAT THEY ARE

01:34:08 PLAYING.

01:34:12 >> I DO NOT THE MARAN MARKET IS GETTING AHEAD OF ITSELF.

01:34:16 I THINK THE DISTRIBUTION OF RISKS HAVE CHANGED.

01:34:20 THAT IS WHAT I THINK THE BOND MARKET IS DOING.

01:34:23 I THINK THEY ARE RIGHT TO DO THAT.

01:34:27 THINK ABOUT IT ON BASICALLY THREE PRONGS.

01:34:31 IF THE FED CAN LOOK AT THE LABOR MARKET AND SAY THEY ARE

01:34:33 REBALANCED? THAT IS CHECKED. DONE.

01:34:41 YOU CANNOT USE THAT AS A REASON NOT TO BE HAWKISH.

01:34:44 THE DISTRIBUTION OF RISKS ARE THAT THEY WOULD CUT BECAUSE OF

01:34:46 LABOR MARKETS. IF THEY ARE THAWING, THAT WILL

01:34:52 GIVE THEM INCREASED CONFIDENCE THAT INFLATION WILL BE THAWING.

01:34:59 FINALLY, IF THAT IS THE CASE, THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE

01:35:02 PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE EASING OF FINANCIAL

01:35:03 CONDITION SINCE LAST WEEK. JONATHAN:

01:35:07 THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS MORNING.

01:35:10 IT FEELS LIKE PERHAPS THEY WILL. WORK WITH ME HERE.

01:35:15 IT FEELS LIKE YOU BELIEVE THAT THE WORLD MAY HAVE CHANGED.

01:35:20 DO YOU SENSE THAT THEY STILL BELIEVE THAT WE ARE STILL IN

01:35:22 THE SAME WORLD?

01:35:24 >> THEY DO. EVEN CHAIR POWELL.

01:35:31 THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF RELUCTANCE TO JUST SAY THAT

01:35:32 NEUTRAL RATES ARE HIGHER.

01:35:38 JONATHAN: WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS?

01:35:41 >> I DO NOT KNOW. IN THEIR MIND, THINGS HAVE NOT

01:35:43 CHANGED. HE SAW IT IN THE PRESS CONFERENCE LAST WEEK.

01:35:52 IF YOU DO NOT THINK THAT THE WORLD HAS FUNDAMENTALLY

01:35:59 CHANGED, YOU WILL BE MORE COGNIZANT OF TIGHTENING RISKS.

01:36:03 YOU MAY HAVE THOUGHT, MAYBE YOU OVERDID IT ON THE SEA MIGHT BE

01:36:05 WILLING TO CUT SOONER.

01:36:11 >> YOU EXPECT INFLATION TO REMAIN HIGHER?

01:36:15 THIS COULD BE A POLICY ERA.

01:36:25 JONATHAN: I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU AROUND

01:36:30 THE TABLE NEXT TIME BUT WHAT YOU THINK IS THE NUMBER ONE

01:36:32 THING THAT INDICATES THAT THE WORLD HAS CHANGED VERSUS

01:36:35 PRE-PANDEMIC? WHAT WOULD YOU .2? >> LOOK AT THE OBVIOUS.

01:36:43 YOU HAVE DONE A LOT AND YET THE ECONOMY IS STILL HANGING IN

01:36:52 THERE. HOUSEHOLD FORMATION READS, BUT

01:36:56 THEY DID AFTER THE FINANCIAL CRISIS -- IT IS EASIER TO TELL

01:37:00 THE STORY ABOUT AN ANOMALY. I THINK WE ARE GOING BACK TO

01:37:04 THE OLD NORMAL. YOU THINK ABOUT ALL THOSE

01:37:08 PEOPLE DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS PERIOD THAT WERE SAVING

01:37:11 UP FOR RETIREMENT. MANY HAVE SINCE RETIRED AND ARE

01:37:16 SAVING. THINK ABOUT INCOME INEQUALITY.

01:37:24 IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THROUGH 2010.

01:37:28 PEOPLE AT THE LOWER END ARE SEEING MORE RAPID GROWTH.

01:37:33 THEY ARE SEEING UNIONS GETTING BIG WINS.

01:37:38 THOSE PEOPLE HAVE A HIGHER PROPENSITY TO SPEND.

01:37:43 I THINK IT IS NOT RIGHT IN MY VIEW TO SAY THAT THINGS HAVE

01:37:47 NOT CHANGED, BUT IF THAT IS WHAT THE FED BELIEVES, YOU HAVE

01:37:50 TO RECOGNIZE WHAT THAT MIGHT IMPLY FOR WHAT THEY MIGHT DO

01:37:51 LATER. JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT CUT NOW DOES NOT

01:37:56 MEAN THAT THEY WILL NOT BE TALKING ABOUT THEM IN THREE TO

01:38:00 SIX MONTHS. I THINK -- I'M NOT WILLING TO

01:38:05 FIGHT THE MOVE YET.

01:38:07 JONATHAN: YOU KNOW YOU ARE ONE OF MY

01:38:12 FAVORITES. THAT IS ULTIMATELY THE DIVIDING

01:38:15 LINE RIGHT NOW. SOME PEOPLE STILL BELIEVE IN

01:38:21 THE OLD WORLD, THAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN A CHANGE.

01:38:23 IT IS PRETTY BRUTAL. LISA:

01:38:29 I DO NOT KNOW IF THIS IS THE ISSUE.

01:38:32 IN FAIRNESS, LET US MOVE ON.

01:38:40 JONATHAN: 20 US SHORTLY COME IN THE BOND

01:38:42 MARKET YIELD ON THE TREASURY. YOUR 10 YEAR YIELD.

01:39:01 >> EVERYONE IS STILL SO BEARISH. >> WE ARE SEEING MORE FOCUS ON

01:39:06 SELECTIVITY FROM OUR CREDIT INVESTORS.

01:39:09 >> THE MARKETS ARE TELLING YOU THAT THEY ARE PRICING SOME

01:39:11 EASING.

01:39:15 >> IT'S A MATTER OF WHO WILL BLINK FIRST, THE CONSUMERS OR

01:39:16 THE CORPORATIONS.

01:39:21 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE WITH TOM KEENE,

01:39:22 JONATHAN FERRO, AND LISA ABRAMOWICZ. JONATHAN:

01:39:26 LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY THIS MORNING, GOOD MORNING.

01:39:27 GOOD MORNING. THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE.

01:39:34 ALONGSIDE LISA ABRAMOWICZ, I AM JONATHAN FERRO.

01:39:38 THE LAST 30 MINUTES PERFECTLY CAPTURES THE DEBATE IN MARKETS.

01:39:44 FED OFFICIALS SAY NO RATES ARE COMING, AND THEN YOU HAVE A

01:39:45 GUEST SAYING THAT RATES ARE COMING. LISA:

01:39:49 ANYTIME THEY TELL YOU SOMETHING IS NOT HAPPENING, THREE MONTH

01:39:51 LATER, GUESS WHAT. THE KEY QUESTION IS HOW MUCH IS

01:40:00 THIS A REPRISAL, HOW MUCH IS THIS TRUE WEAKNESS IN THE

01:40:04 ECONOMY VERSUS BECOMING INCONVENIENT TO HAVE TIGHT

01:40:05 POLICY WHEN PEOPLE ARE FEELING PAIN?

01:40:08 WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION A LONG TIME AGO AND THE PAIN NEVER

01:40:11 HAPPENED, SO WE NEVER HAD TO TEST THE RESOLVE OF FED

01:40:13 OFFICIALS. JONATHAN: YOU'LL KASHKARI WANTS TO REMAIN

01:40:17 VIGILANT. THE RISK HERE IS THAT YOU WILL

01:40:20 UNDO THINGS. YOU NEED TO HAVE CONVICTION

01:40:24 THAT INFLATION IS GOING BACK TO 2%. I WILL READ WHAT HE WROTE

01:40:30 EARLIER THIS WEEK, ULTIMATELY THE LABOR MARKET IS NO LONGER A

01:40:31 REASON TO BE HAWKISH. LISA: WHEN YOU ARE SEEING PRICING THE

01:40:35 MARKET. HOW LONG WERE YOU PRACTICING A

01:40:40 TALE OF TWO NEIL'S? THAT WAS REALLY GOOD.

01:40:47 SORT OF THE MORNING OF TWOMEIL'S.

01:40:50 VIEWS THAT ARE POLARIZING THE MARKET.

01:40:55 THE FED PUT HIS BACK AND THAT IS YOUR INSURANCE POLICY IF

01:40:56 THINGS GO SOUTH. IS THAT WHEN YOU ARE FEELING

01:40:59 AND BROADER EQUITIES RIGHT NOW? JONATHAN:

01:41:02 THAT IS THE BULLISH REVIEW. HERE IS THE PUSHBACK.

01:41:12 JP MORGAN, FALLING BOND YIELDS, DOVISH CENTRAL BANKS, TAKE YOUR

01:41:13 PICK. ULTIMATELY THE GROWTH POLICY

01:41:18 TRADE-OFF WILL BE CHALLENGING INTO YEAR-END.

01:41:20 THE TRADE-OFF IS IMPORTANT. THE FED STAYS ON HOLD UNTIL

01:41:23 YEAR-END. GROWTH INTO THE THIRD QUARTER

01:41:28 WILL BE SLOWER. LISA: COULD YOU GET LITTLE PAIN AND

01:41:31 THE FED STILL CUTTING RATES? THAT IS ESSENTIALLY WHAT YOU'RE

01:41:36 LOOKING AT FROM THE BULLISH

01:41:42 HOPES AND DREAMS, SOFT LANDING, DISINFLATION, AND A FED THAT

01:41:44 ADJUSTS BECAUSE THEY DON'T NEED TO DO MORE.

01:41:49 WHAT WE CAN SEE NOW IS THE FED HAS NO WAY OF GUIDING PEOPLE

01:41:51 BECAUSE THEY ARE WATCHING THE DATA AS EVERYONE ELSE.

01:41:55 MARKETS ARE STILL TIED TO THE IDEA THAT THE FED CANNOT HURT

01:41:58 THEM TOO BADLY, AND THAT SEEMS TO BE WHERE WE ARE. JONATHAN:

01:42:02 THE WARM EMBRACE OF CHAIRMAN POWELL. S&P FUTURES KEEPING IT

01:42:05 TOGETHER. LISA: SO MANY IMAGES THIS MORNING.

01:42:11 JONATHAN: EQUITIES ON THE S&P, -02%.

01:42:20 TONS OF ISSUANCE THIS WEEK. WE WILL TALK ABOUT IT THIS WEEK

01:42:23 FROM THE TREASURY. THIS HAS TO BECOME A MAINSTREAM

01:42:26 STORY. ALL THE ISSUANCE COMING FROM

01:42:30 TREASURY, ALL THE SUPPLY. $48 BILLION IN THREE YOUR NOTES.

01:42:37 24 BILLION DOLLARS IN 30-YEAR BONDS.

01:42:40 THAT IS A LOT OF SUPPLY HITTING THE MARKET. LISA:

01:42:44 WE HAVE NOT TALKED ABOUT SUPPLY FOR DECADES, AND THE REASON WE

01:42:47 ARE TALKING ABOUT IT NOW, IF YIELDS GO UP, ALL OF A SUDDEN

01:42:51 IS MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE U.S. TO KEEP SPENDING.

01:42:56 THAT ENDS UP IN A POLITICAL DISCUSSION BECAUSE INTEREST

01:43:00 PAYMENTS IN 2050 WILL EQUAL SOMETHING LIKE 8% OF TOTAL GDP

01:43:02 IF RATES REMAIN WHERE THEY ARE. IF YOU LOOK AT THAT KIND OF

01:43:07 MATH, IT IS DEEPLY UNCOMFORTABLE POLITICALLY

01:43:09 VERSUS PEOPLE GOING BACK TO LOWER RATES IN MAKING THIS

01:43:13 SUSTAINABLE. JONATHAN: WAITING FOR THE DAY WHEN THE

01:43:17 WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY OPENS UP THE BRIEFING WITH THE

01:43:19 YIELD ON THE 10 YEAR. THEN YOU GET ALL OF THESE D.C.

01:43:23 JOURNALISTS TRY TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THE BOND MARKET.

01:43:25 WHO KNOWS.

01:43:31 ALICIA LEVINE, HEAD OF INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND EQUITY

01:43:34 ADVISOR SOLUTIONS IS HERE WITH US.

01:43:38 HAVE WE OPENED THE DOOR FOR A YEAR-END RALLY? ALICIA:

01:43:40 I THINK WE HAVE. THERE IS CLEARLY A MARKET

01:43:45 CLEARING PRICE IN THE 10 YEAR, A LITTLE BIT ABOUT 5%, AND THAT

01:43:49 IS WHERE OUR CEILING IS HERE. YOU HAVE SEEN, TRYING TO GET

01:43:59 ABOVE 5%, GETS BATTED DOWN AGAIN. I WILL SAY THIS.

01:44:04 THE GEOPOLITICAL RISK OUT THERE IS STILL SOMEWHAT, THE TALES

01:44:10 ARE GROWING, BUT ULTIMATELY THE FEAR AND LOATHING IN THIS

01:44:12 MARKET HAS BEEN ABOUT SUPPLY AND YIELD.

01:44:16 WHAT WE LEARNED LAST WEEK, THE MARKET CLEARING PRICE WILL TAKE

01:44:17 CARE OF THE. JONATHAN:

01:44:24 I MENTIONED MARKETS AND JP MORGAN, STRESSING THAT THE

01:44:25 GROWTH POLICY WILL RAIN CHALLENGING INTO YEAR-END.

01:44:29 MIKE WILSON, MORGAN STANLEY, BEARISH ALL YEAR.

01:44:33 WHAT DO YOU SAY TO ALL OF THOSE GUYS? ALICIA:

01:44:37 IT HAS BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO REJECT ANYTHING IN THIS WEIRD

01:44:40 ENVIRONMENT. EVEN IF YOU GOT INFLATION

01:44:43 RIGHT, STICKY ON THE WAY DOWN, FED HIKING MORE AT THE

01:44:46 BEGINNING OF THE YEAR, STILL UP 14% ON THE S&P.

01:44:51 LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN FINANCIAL

01:44:52 ASSETS AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE FUNDAMENTALS.

01:44:56 IT IS VERY RARE TO HAVE TWO VERY NEGATIVE YEARS IN THE

01:45:00 EQUITY MARKET FOLLOWING EACH OTHER.

01:45:05 IT CAN HAPPEN, BUT ABSENT A CALAMITY, NOT LIKELY TO HAPPEN.

01:45:07 THOSE ARE KNOWN RISKS. THE FACT THAT WE HAVE

01:45:13 TIGHTENING, THE LOAN OFFICER SURVEY SHOWS FURTHER TIGHTENING

01:45:14 GOING ON FOR SIX QUARTERS. THAT IS KNOWN.

01:45:18 ALL THE PROBLEMS OUT THERE ARE KNOWN.

01:45:22 IN A WEIRD WAY IT IS A TAILWIND BECAUSE SENTIMENT IS QUITE

01:45:23 NEGATIVE STILL. IT IS NOT THAT THEY ARE WRONG.

01:45:28 IT MAKES INTELLECTUAL SENSE. I FEEL AT HOME WITH THAT.

01:45:33 BUT WE HAVE TO INVEST CLIENT MONEY IN THE REAL WORLD AND NOT

01:45:34 JUST TALK ABOUT IT. IF YOU ARE UNDERWEIGHT EQUITIES

01:45:43 THIS YEAR BECAUSE YOU FIGURED A FED-INDUCED MASSIVE RECESSION

01:45:44 AND UNEMPLOYMENT COME YOU DIDN'T MAKE THE YEAR. LISA:

01:45:47 WE TALK ABOUT EQUITIES AS IF THEY ARE A MONOLITH, BUT THE

01:45:52 RUSSELL 2000 REALLY UNDERPERFORMING, KBW BANK INDEX

01:45:53 REALLY UNDERPERFORMING. THERE ARE SPOTS THAT ARE HINGED

01:45:58 TO THE REAL ECONOMY THAT ARE STRUGGLING.

01:46:02 IS IT THOSE AREAS OR YOUR USUAL SUSPECTS THAT HAVE BEEN DOING

01:46:03 WELL ALL YEAR? ALICIA: WE ARE TALKING ABOUT LARGE CAP

01:46:07 AMERICA, THE S&P. SMALL CAPS ARE MOST EXPOSED TO

01:46:12 THE RIGHT CYCLE BECAUSE OF THE REFINANCING COST AND THE NEED

01:46:15 TO GROW. THE FURTHER YOU GO DOWN ON THE

01:46:20 CAP SCALE, THAT IS WHERE IT IS.

01:46:30 HAVING SAID THAT, TO NEAL DUNTT A'S POINT, THERE COULD BE A

01:46:31 RALLY IN SMALL CAPS. THAT IN ITSELF IS INTERESTING

01:46:39 BECAUSE, YOU TURN THE PAGE, THE MUTUAL FUNDS IN OCTOBER,

01:46:43 EVERYONE ELSE UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR, AND THEN YOU WIND UP

01:46:45 WITH A REVERSION TRADE IN JANUARY.

01:46:48 IT COULD BE A GREAT INVESTING OPPORTUNITY.

01:46:52 IT IS NOT THAT WE DON'T KNOW THAT SMALL CAPS ARE VULNERABLE.

01:46:55 THAT IS WHY THEY ARE PRICED THE WAY THEY ARE TODAY. LISA:

01:47:00 PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT THE RALLY IN EQUITIES, SAYING IT IS

01:47:01 BECAUSE WE FOUND STABILITY IN BONDS.

01:47:04 IS IT STABILITY OR WAS IT A RALLY? WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE?

01:47:11 IS IT ENOUGH TO HAVE YIELDS BOUNCING AROUND IN A RANGE THAT

01:47:15 IS BELOW 5%, ABOUT 4%, AND EVEN IF IT IS A PRETTY BROAD RANGE,

01:47:16 IT WILL BE OK? ALICIA: GREAT QUESTION ABOUT STABILITY

01:47:20 AND THE RALLY. EXCELLENT QUESTION. LISA:

01:47:24 I STOLE IT FROM HIM.

01:47:30 ALICIA: I THINK THE ISSUE IS THE STABILITY.

01:47:34 THIS YEAR, THE VOLATILITY IN THE BOND MARKET, LESS SO

01:47:39 VOLATILITY IN THE EQUITY MARKET, WHICH HIT 13 AT ONE

01:47:43 POINT, IT IS THE VOLATILITY IN THE BOND MARKET THAT HAS DRIVEN

01:47:44 SOME OF THE RISK OFF BEHAVIOR. YOU GET STABILITY THERE, SOME

01:47:50 SENSE OF PRICING, MAY BE CEILING ON THE 10-YEAR.

01:47:59 THE THOUGHT OF 6% YIELDS SEEMS LESS LIKELY TODAY THAN TWO

01:48:03 WEEKS AGO, AND THAT IS INFORMATION, STABILIZES THE

01:48:04 EQUITY MARKET. JONATHAN: WHERE YOU WANT TO BE IF THAT

01:48:07 STARTS TO EVOLVE? CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY REALLY

01:48:11 BEAT UP OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS. ALICIA:

01:48:15 I THINK YOU HAVE TO BE IN LARGE CAP TECH.

01:48:17 THAT IS ABOUT GROWTH WITHOUT NEEDING TO BORROW.

01:48:21 THAT IS PART OF THE REASON WHY THIS SECTOR RALLIED SO FAR IN

01:48:24 THE FIRST PART OF THE YEAR AS THE FED WAS HIKING.

01:48:30 COMPANY THAT DON'T NEED TO BORROW, THEY HAVE INHERENT

01:48:32 GROWTH, THEY HAVE A PSYCHO COMING UP WITH AI.

01:48:36 I LIKE GOING INTO SECTORS THAT ARE MOST HATED.

01:48:39 THERE IS ALWAYS A REVERSION IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR.

01:48:42 PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DUMP THE LOSERS INTO THE END OF THE YEAR.

01:48:45 THEN I THINK YOU CAN GET IN FRONT OF IT.

01:48:51 FOR THE MOST PART, WE ARE OVERWEIGHT U.S.

01:48:52 ASSETS VERSUS REST OF WORLD.

01:48:59 60% U.S., 40% REST OF THE WORLD -- WE DON'T DO THAT.

01:49:03 YOU HAVE NOT GOTTEN PAID TO BE IN EMERGING MARKETS OR EUROPE.

01:49:06 I'M SORRY, JONATHAN. JONATHAN: NOT PERSONAL, DON'T WORRY.

01:49:12 ALICIA: WE HAVE RUN DATA ON THIS ALL

01:49:13 THE TIME. WHILE YOU CAN HAVE A GREAT YEAR

01:49:18 OR TWO A GREAT PERFORMANCE, OVER TIME, LONG-TERM MONEY, YOU

01:49:21 ARE NOT BEING PAID. WE ARE THERE BECAUSE WE NEED TO

01:49:26 BE, BUT IS NOT REALLY DIVERSIFICATION. JONATHAN:

01:49:29 A GUEST CAME ON THE SIDE AND

01:49:31 SAID ON THE AIR, DON'T GET ME WRONG, EUROPE IS GREAT FOR

01:49:35 VACATIONS AND BAD FOR INVESTING. THAT WAS THE MANTRA FOR THE

01:49:38 NEXT DECADE. LISA: HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT BEING THE

01:49:42 AMBASSADOR FOR INVESTMENTS IN ALL OF EUROPE? JONATHAN: T.K.

01:49:48 STILL THINGS I AM PAID IN STERLING.

01:49:51 THE LEGACY OF ZERO INTEREST RATES. WEWORK, TO GO FROM A $47

01:50:00 BILLION VALUATION IN 2019, BUT TO LEARN THIS MORNING IT HAS

01:50:05 GONE BANKRUPT, HAVE WE FULLY REALIZED THE PAIN ASSOCIATED

01:50:07 WITH EVERYTHING THAT WE GOT UP TO IN THIS MARKET 10 YEARS AGO?

01:50:09 ALICIA: THE POSTER CHILD. WHEN MONEY IS FREE, WHAT YOU

01:50:16 CAN CREATE, NEGATIVE CASH FLOW CAN SUSTAIN A BUSINESS WITH

01:50:18 EVER-INCREASING VALUATIONS. U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS THE SAME

01:50:21 PROBLEM, AS YOU TALKED ABOUT. THAT INTEREST COSTS WERE 200

01:50:24 BILLION. LOW INTEREST RATES ALLOW FOR A

01:50:29 LOT OF SPENDING. IN A SENSE, EVERY BALANCE SHEET

01:50:36 LOOK LIKE A PRIVATE EQUITY FIRM BECAUSE YOU KEEP ON FUNDING IT.

01:50:37 THAT IS OVER. THE WEWORKS OF THE WORLD WILL

01:50:42 BE GETTING A VALUATION CUT. THE AREAS THAT WE WILL SEE,

01:50:48 COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE, BUT NOT A SECRET.

01:50:52 THAT IS WHY THE SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BANKS FEEL

01:50:55 TRAUMATIZED RIGHT NOW, PROBABLY STATIC.

01:50:58 THAT STORY IS NOT COMPLETELY DONE.

01:51:01 I DON'T WANT TO PAINT A PICTURE THAT IT IS PERFECT BUT WE KNOW

01:51:02 WHERE THE RISKS ARE. JONATHAN: THERE IS A DIFFERENCE IN THE

01:51:08 OPPORTUNITY OF THE YEAR AND AND NOT HAVING THE FINANCING YET.

01:51:13 WE COULD SAY THAT FED FUNDS IS WHATEVER, BUT CAN YOU SAY THAT

01:51:14 PEOPLE ARE PAYING IT? WE TALKED WITH NEEL KASHKARI

01:51:20 BEING LOCKED OUT OF THE HOUSING MARKET, SITTING ON 2% MORTGAGE

01:51:21 RATES. SO MUCH OF THIS HAS STILL NOT

01:51:24 COME TO THE SURFACE. LISA: BORROWING COSTS HAVE GONE.

01:51:27 FOR CORPORATE AMERICA IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS. ALICIA:

01:51:32 THEY CAN FINANCE THEIR DEBT BECAUSE EVERYONE HAS DEBT AT 3%

01:51:36 AND THEY ARE MAKING 5% ON THEIR CASH.

01:51:41 THAT CAN CONTINUE FOR A WHILE, AND MY WE HAVE NOT HAD THE

01:51:42 RECESSION. JONATHAN: GREAT TO SEE YOU, ALICIA.

01:51:47 IF YOU ARE JUST JOINING US, WELCOME TO THE PROGRAM.

01:51:52 THE S&P -0.2%. LOTS OF ISSUANCE STILL TO COME.

01:51:58 THE 10-YEAR IS TOMORROW. $40 BILLION WORTH OF 10 YEAR

01:52:00 NOTES. LISA: SOME ARE SAYING THAT YESTERDAY

01:52:05 SO LOVE CAME BECAUSE THERE WAS A SLEW OF INVESTMENT GRADE

01:52:06 ISSUANCE. WE HAVE NOT SEEN THAT REFINANCING WAVE.

01:52:12 IF WE GET STABILITY IN TREASURY YIELDS AND PEOPLE START TO

01:52:14 BORROW, DO WE START TO SEE HOW MANY WEWORKS THERE ARE OUT

01:52:17 THERE? WEWORK IS ITS OWN STORY AND

01:52:22 PHILOSOPHY, SITUATION. 750 PROPERTIES THEY HAVE TO

01:52:27 DEAL WITH, BUT A QUESTION OF HOW MANY SIMILAR TYPES OF

01:52:32 DEBACLES ARE LINING UP? JONATHAN: ADAM NEUMANN.

01:52:41 IF THERE IS A BUBBLE, BUT IT, AND THEN HE GOT OUT.

01:52:44 AND HE GOT PUSHED OUT. GREGORY DACO COMING UP LATER ON.

01:53:03 >> CAN FOCUS ON THE ECONOMY. IT IS NOT ONLY KIDDING, IT IS

01:53:06 KING, QUEEN, AND BISHOP. THAT IS GOING TO BE A HUGE

01:53:10 FACTOR IN WHERE PEOPLE PLACE THEIR VOTES IN NOVEMBER 2024.

01:53:16 AS YOU KNOW, WE ARE LIGHT YEARS AHEAD FROM WHERE THAT IS IN

01:53:18 TERMS OF ASSESSING WHERE THE ECONOMY IS GOING TO BE THEN.

01:53:21 THAT WILL BE THE MAJOR FACTOR. JONATHAN:

01:53:25 12 MONTHS AWAY, MOHAMMAD YUNUS OVER AT GALLUP.

01:53:28 YOU CAN WATCH THE CONVERSATION AT BLOOMBERG.COM.

01:53:32 PUTTING OUT THIS RECENTLY, WORTH READING.

01:53:37 TWO MAJOR POLITICAL PARTIES REMAIN UNPOPULAR WITH 56% OF

01:53:41 AMERICANS VIEWING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY UNFAVORABLY.

01:53:45 58% SAY THE SAME ABOUT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

01:53:47 THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. 53% OF AMERICANS BELIEVE THE

01:53:53 REPUBLICAN PARTY WOULD DO A BETTER JOB OF KEEPING THE

01:53:55 COUNTRY PROSPEROUS OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS WHEREAS 39%

01:53:58 CHOOSE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THAT IS A PROBLEM FOR THE WHITE

01:54:01 HOUSE INTO NEXT YEAR. LISA: THAT IS SOMETHING ONGOING IN

01:54:06 TERMS OF THE PERCEPTION OF BOTH PARTIES, ONE THEORY, ONE PARTY

01:54:13 TENDS TO GOVERN WHEN THINGS ARE GOING WELL, THE OTHER ONE COMES

01:54:14 IN WHEN IS ARE GOING BADLY. THE REAL QUESTION TO ME IS WHAT

01:54:19 IS THE ECONOMIC ISSUE PEOPLE WILL HINGE ON?

01:54:22 BRINGING DOWN INFLATION, THE DEBT, INTERNATIONAL INVOLVEMENT

01:54:25 OR LOCAL INVOLVEMENT? WHAT ARE PEOPLE FEELING IF THEY

01:54:29 ARE STILL GETTING RAISES? IF YOU LOOK AT THE OVERALL

01:54:33 ECONOMY, FED OFFICIALS SAY IT IS STRONG.

01:54:37 NEEL KASHKARI SAYS HE IS NOT SEEING WEAKNESS IN THIS ECONOMY.

01:54:40 JONATHAN: WE JUST HAD A QUARTER OF GDP

01:54:42 CLOSE TO 5%. LISA: PEOPLE ARE SAYING THE ECONOMY

01:54:48 IS NOT STRONG AND NOT GOING ALONG, SO WHAT ARE PEOPLE

01:54:51 TALKING ABOUT WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT ECONOMIC STRENGTH?

01:54:53 JONATHAN: THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT PRICES.

01:54:56 YOU CANNOT GET AWAY FROM IT. YOU CAN TALK ABOUT INFLATION,

01:55:02 PRICES NOT CLIMBING AT THE SAME RATE, BUT ULTIMATELY YOU LOOK

01:55:04 AT YOUR BILLS AND YOU THINK ABOUT THINGS PERSONALLY.

01:55:09 NOT CPI, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT HOW WALL STREET REACTS TO IT.

01:55:13 PEOPLE FEEL THINGS ARE A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE NOW THAN FOUR

01:55:18 YEARS BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. LISA: IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT THEY CAN DO

01:55:22 TO FIX THAT UNLESS TIME HEALS ALL AND WE GET REAL

01:55:25 DISINFLATION OR DEFLATION BY NEXT YEAR. JONATHAN:

01:55:29 THE FED CANNOT REJECT ANY OF THIS, WE CANNOT PREDICT 12

01:55:31 MONTHS OUT. IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO BE

01:55:36 DIPPED ANYTHING ABOUT THE ECONOMY, POLITICS INTO NOVEMBER.

01:55:40 EQUITY MARKETS ARE SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE BY 0.2% ON THE S&P 500.

01:55:46 BOND YIELDS, 4.62.

01:55:48 JOINING US NOW IS HENRIETTA TREYZ, MANAGING PARTNER OVER AT

01:55:54 VEDA PARTNERS. NEW YORK TIMES, SIENA COLLEGE,

01:55:58 TERRIBLE READINGS OR THE SITTING PRESIDENT.

01:56:01 DO YOU EXPECT THAT TO CHANGE ANYTIME SOON? HENRIETTA:

01:56:05 I WANT TO SEE WITH THE TURNOUT IN VIRGINIA LOOKS LIKE, TELLS

01:56:07 US WHERE THE POLLS ARE RIGHT AND WRONG.

01:56:10 ONE OF THE STRIKING COMPONENTS OF THAT POLE, YOU ARE LOOKING

01:56:15 AT A STATE LIKE NEVADA, HISTORICALLY VERY TIGHT BUT

01:56:16 RELIABLY BLUE.

01:56:23 IT SUGGESTS THAT POLLSTERS ARE FINDING A 13-POINT SWING AWAY

01:56:24 FROM DEMOCRATS TOWARD REPUBLICANS.

01:56:27 I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU THAT IS IN A NORMATIVE SWING.

01:56:29 AMERICANS DON'T CHANGE THEIR MINDS LIKE THAT.

01:56:33 TO SEE THAT KIND OF SWING IS EITHER AN OUTLIER.

01:56:36 THE POLLING IS CONSISTENT WITH OTHERS THAT WE HAVE SEEN BUT WE

01:56:40 WILL SEE A REAL OPPORTUNITY WHETHER THAT POLLING HOLDS TRUE

01:56:43 IN VIRGINIA TODAY, WHERE THERE ARE HOUSE AND SENATE ELECTIONS.

01:56:48 IT COULD POTENTIALLY GET GLENN YOUNGKIN TO DECIDE IF HE WANTS

01:56:50 TO JUMP INTO THE REPUBLICAN RACE.

01:56:55 I THINK WE HAVE SOMETHING RARE IN D.C., A REAL POLL THAT WE

01:56:58 CAN WATCH FOR AN ELECTION. LISA: PEOPLE DEBATING IF THIS IS

01:57:03 REAL, IF GLENN YOUNGKIN TRULY WANTS TO GET INTO THE RUNNING

01:57:08 THIS CYCLE, OR IF HE WILL WAIT AFTER HIS 2026 TERM ENDS.

01:57:12 DO YOU THINK TODAY'S ELECTION COULD TRULY DETERMINE AND PUSH

01:57:14 GLENN YOUNGKIN INTO THE RACE? HENRIETTA: ABSOLUTELY.

01:57:20 I DON'T THINK THERE IS A LANE FOR HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE.

01:57:25 NIKKI HALEY HAS USURPED THAT WITH HER STRONG SHOWING IN NEW

01:57:31 HAMPSHIRE.

01:57:32 BUT THE THREE REMAINING CANDIDATES, THEY ARE LIGHT

01:57:34 YEARS BEHIND DONALD TRUMP. IT WOULD BE SMARTER FOR HIM TO

01:57:38 WAIT UNTIL 2026, GET IN THE TIME AROUND, BUT THIS IS A

01:57:43 SIGNAL THAT MAYBE HE HAS AN OUTSIDE CHANCE TO WIN.

01:57:47 IF THERE IS A RED WAVE, I WOULD ASSUME HE WOULD WRITE IT, TRY

01:57:53 TO BOLSTER HIS ABILITY, IN ADVANCE OF THE NEXT CYCLE.

01:58:00 ALL POLLSTERS, PROGNOSTICATORS IN VIRGINIA ARE PREDICTING A

01:58:03 DEMOCRATIC WIN TONIGHT, PARTICULARLY AS THE VOTES COME

01:58:04 IN LATER.

01:58:10 I DON'T EXPECT HIM TO GET IN, BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT COULD

01:58:13 WELL HAPPEN IF THE RESULTS ARE SURPRISE. LISA:

01:58:17 THE FACT THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT I LIKE THE FACT THAT

01:58:20 PEOPLE ARE NOT EXCITED ABOUT A MATCHUP OF TRUMP VERSUS BIDEN.

01:58:25 DO YOU THINK IT IS REALISTIC THAT ONE OF THE CANDIDATES ON

01:58:29 WEDNESDAY'S STAGE WILL RISE TO THE OCCASION AND TAKE THE PLACE

01:58:30 OF FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP? OR IS THIS ESSENTIALLY WHAT

01:58:33 PEOPLE WILL HAVE, THIS IS WHAT THE LANDSCAPE WILL LOOK LIKE

01:58:36 NEXT YEAR? HENRIETTA: THIS IS WHAT THE LANDSCAPE WILL

01:58:39 LOOK LIKE. TO SAY THERE IS A PRESIDENTIAL

01:58:44 CANDIDATE IN ALL OF THE PRIMARIES RUNNING 31 POINTS

01:58:48 AHEAD OF HIS NEXT CLOSEST COMPETITOR IS RIDICULOUS ON ITS

01:58:52 FACE, TO THINK IT WOULD BE A DIFFERENT OUTCOME.

01:58:54 MY ANTICIPATION IS IT WILL BE TRUMP AND BIDEN.

01:58:57 WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN THE POLLS RIGHT NOW IS DISCONTENT WITH

01:59:01 BOTH OF THEM. YOU HAVE A HUGE CHUNK OF

01:59:04 UNDECIDED VOTERS WHO WILL EITHER NOT PARTICIPATE, HAVE

01:59:07 NOT GOTTEN COMFORTABLE WITH THE FACT THAT THESE ARE THE ONLY

01:59:08 TWO OPTIONS. LISA: DO TRUMP'S LEGAL ISSUES MATTER?

01:59:15 HENRIETTA: I THINK THEY ARE PRESENTING HIM

01:59:21 AS VERY FIERY, SORT OF ENGAGED AND EXCITED, WHICH IS SOMETHING

01:59:24 THAT BIDEN NOTABLY LACKS. THAT NARRATIVE OF HIM BEING

01:59:32 OLD, DESPITE THE TWO OF THEM BEING SEPARATED BY A COUPLE OF

01:59:34 YEARS, MAKES THEM LOOK VIBRANT. IT MAKES BIDEN LOOK LETHARGIC,

01:59:39 AND THAT IS PROBABLY THE ENTIRE GOAL.

01:59:44 HE IS LIKELY TO LOSE THESE 91 DIFFERENT COUNTS, BUT THE POINT

01:59:48 IS TO PRESENT AS AGGRESSIVE AND VIVACIOUS, AND THAT IS WHAT HE

01:59:49 IS DOING. JONATHAN: I WANT TO PUT TOGETHER TWO

01:59:55 STORIES FROM THE PAST WEEK, THE SITUATION IN THE MIDDLE EAST,

01:59:58 ISRAEL, THEY WILL ALWAYS BE DIVISION IN A PARTY OVER A

01:59:59 SINGLE ISSUE. ALWAYS AN EXTREME FRINGE TO THE

02:00:04 LEFT OR THE RIGHT. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THINGS TO

02:00:06 THE LEFT. HOW DO YOU THINK THIS PRESIDENT

02:00:11 WILL HANDLE SOME OF THE PUSHBACK HE IS SEEING FROM

02:00:14 WITHIN HIS OWN PARTY TO HIS SUPPORT THAT HE HAS OFFERED

02:00:17 ISRAEL FOLLOWING THE TERRORIST ATTACKS THAT WE ALL WITNESSED

02:00:21 ON AND RATHER GRAPHIC, TRAGIC WAYS IN THE LAST MONTH?

02:00:25 HENRIETTA: ALL EYES ARE ON ANTONY BLINKEN

02:00:29 RIGHT NOW. CERTAINLY DOING WORK ACROSS THE

02:00:33 ENTIRE REGION TO TRY AND AT LEAST STEM WHAT COULD BE A

02:00:34 MASSIVE ESCALATION.

02:00:40 THE WHITE HOUSE'S POSITION TO STRONG-ARM ISRAEL BEHIND CLOSED

02:00:44 DOORS IS INCREASINGLY BECOMING UNTENABLE AND THEY HAVE TO GO

02:00:48 PUBLIC WITH THAT. THE ATROCITIES ARE NOW SEEPING

02:00:51 OUT INTO MAINSTREAM AMERICAN NEWS CYCLES, AND THEY ARE

02:00:52 ATROCIOUS ON BOTH SIDES. I THINK VOTERS ON THE LEFT AND

02:00:56 THE RIGHT ARE HAVING A REALLY HARD TIME WITH IT.

02:01:00 MY QUESTION IS HOW LONG CAN BIDEN KEEP HIS ANXIETY,

02:01:05 PRESSURE SYSTEM ON NETANYAHU IN PRIVATE? THAT IS THE NEXT STEP.

02:01:09 I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THAT COMES QUICKLY.

02:01:12 THAT IS WHY THEY ARE TRYING TO PASS THIS GOVERNMENT FUNDING

02:01:16 BILL AS FAST AS POSSIBLE WITH AID TO ISRAEL, SAYING IT IS

02:01:20 CONTINGENT ON NEXT, Y, Z. YOU HAVE TO STOP THE ATROCITIES.

02:01:26 JONATHAN: HENRIETTA TREYZ, THANK YOU.

02:01:28 THE PRESSURE BUILDING. WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT

02:01:31 FOR THE PAST FEW WEEKS. LISA: HEADLINES TALKING ABOUT HOW THE

02:01:35 U.S. IS GETTING FRUSTRATED IN TERMS

02:01:39 OF HOW MUCH INFLUENCE IT HAS OVER ISRAEL, EVEN AS ALL OF THE

02:01:44 WORKSHEETS -- WARSHIPS, SUBMARINES GO TO THE

02:01:47 MEDITERRANEAN. IN A POLITICAL SPHERE, WHETHER

02:01:51 IT MATTERS AT HOME. JONATHAN: IT IS SO COMPLEX.

02:01:56 WE DON'T NEED ANOTHER ARMCHAIR GENERAL.

02:01:59 THIS IS SO COMPLEX TO GET YOUR HEAD AROUND. LISA:

02:02:02 DEEPLY EMOTIONAL AND POLARIZING. AS YOU SAY, WE ARE SEEING

02:02:07 DIVISIONS ON THE LEFT THAT ARE CHALLENGING FOR PRESIDENT

02:02:10 BIDEN, ESPECIALLY HEADING INTO THIS ELECTION WITH WING STATES,

02:02:13 MICHIGAN IN PARTICULAR. JONATHAN:

02:02:21 COMING UP IN THE NEXT HOUR, JIM CARON OF JP MORGAN, AND A WHOLE

02:02:24 LOT MORE. EQUITY MARKETS ARE SLIGHTLY

02:02:27 NEGATIVE. I HAVE NOT SEEN THIS FOR A

02:02:30 WHILE. SIX DAYS OF GAINS ON THE S&P.

02:02:36 SEVEN DAYS OF GAINS ON THE NASDAQ 100.

02:02:40 MULTI-YEAR HOW IS THAT WE HAD A LOOK AT A COUPLE YEARS AGO.

02:02:44 FROM NEW YORK CITY, THIS IS BLOOMBERG. ♪

02:03:07 LISA: ONE HOUR INTO THE OPENING BELL,

02:03:08 SOFTNESS ACROSS THE BOARD. WELCOME BACK.

02:03:10 THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE. JONATHAN FERRO IS PREPARING FOR

02:03:14 HIS NEXT HOUR. WE ARE LOOKING AT A REAL DEARTH

02:03:18 OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY SO FAR THIS WEEK.

02:03:24 NOT GETTING A LOT OF DATA AFTER LAST WEEK'S 1-2-3 PUNCH THAT

02:03:27 SENT YIELD PLUMMETING BY 40 BASIS POINTS.

02:03:32 4.62%, JUST TALK TO BASIS POINTS.

02:03:37 A LITTLE BIT OF SOG ON THE EQUITY INDEXES AFTER A ROBUST

02:03:39 SEVEN-DAY RALLY. REAL QUESTIONS AROUND HOW MUCH

02:03:45 WE ARE SEEING STOCKS AND BONDS REFLECT THE SOFT LANDING

02:03:47 SCENARIO THAT A LOT OF FED OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN TALKING

02:03:52 ABOUT.

02:03:54 EARLIER WE SPOKE WITH FED PRESIDENT FROM MINNEAPOLIS NEEL

02:03:56 KASHKARI, TALKING ABOUT THE NEED TO DO MORE.

02:03:58 MICHAEL MCKEE WITH US.

02:04:05 HE HAS GIVEN UP HIS MANTLE AFTER NOT COMING OUT WITH

02:04:06 ANYTHING INTERESTING. MIKE: I HEARD YOU WERE HERE AND

02:04:10 THOUGHT I WOULD SAY HELLO. WE DO HAVE SOME DATA.

02:04:20 SEPTEMBER TRADE BALANCE, $61.5 BILLION, A LITTLE BIT HIGHER

02:04:22 THAN THE $59.8 BILLION INITIALLY REPORTED.

02:04:28 ON THE MARGIN, SLIGHT TAKE AWAY FROM GDP, BUT NOT REALLY GOING

02:04:29 TO MOVE THE NEEDLE. BASICALLY AT THIS POINT, IT IS

02:04:36 A DULL WEEK. JOHN CLAIMS ON THURSDAY AND

02:04:39 THAT IS ABOUT IT. EVERYONE IS LOOKING TO THE FED.

02:04:45 11 SPEAKERS THIS WEEK FROM THE FED.

02:04:50 17 SPEECHES OR APPEARANCES, AND ALMOST NONE OF THEM, WITH THE

02:04:55 POSSIBILITY OF JAY POWELL, MATTE R, BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT

02:04:58 TALKING ABOUT MONETARY POLICY. THIS IS A LONG WAY OF SAYING

02:05:03 THAT OUR INTERVIEW WITH NEEL KASHKARI MATTERS TO THE MARKETS.

02:05:06 LISA: ESPECIALLY WHEN HE IS ONE OF

02:05:09 THE FEW HAWKS PUSHING BACK AGAINST THIS IDEA THAT THE FED

02:05:11 IS DEFINITELY DONE, COMPLACENT. NOT SEEING MUCH OF A REACTION

02:05:16 TO THE TRADE DATA THAT WE DEEMPHASIZED IN ADVANCE OF

02:05:19 THIS, BUT YOU DO SEE THE 10 YEAR LOWER ON THE DAY.

02:05:24 I FIND IT INTERESTING PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO BAKE IN RATE

02:05:27 CUTS, SAYING THAT THE FED HAS REACHED A POINT WHERE THEY ARE

02:05:30 COMPARABLE TO THE DEGREE OF WEAKENING IN THE ECONOMY.

02:05:34 HOW MUCH IS THAT BORNE OUT BY THE DATA?

02:05:37 THAT YOU HAVE SEEN A SOFTENING IN THE FUNDAMENTAL EMPLOYMENT

02:05:41 AND OTHER OUTLOOKS THAT WOULD JUSTIFY THIS SHIFT IN NARRATIVE?

02:05:46 MIKE: YOU HAVE SEEN A SOFTENING IN

02:05:50 THE DATA. UNEMPLOYMENT WENT UP, POINTING

02:05:54 TO THE GDP NUMBERS. IT IS KIND OF RIDICULOUS BUT IT

02:05:59 SHOWS A DROP OFF IN THE ECONOMY SO FAR.

02:06:06 AT THE SAME TIME, THE LAST CPI REPORT, ANOTHER ONE NEXT WEEK,

02:06:11 ON A MONTH OVER MONTH BASIS, PRICES WENT UP.

02:06:16 THE FED IS STILL IN BETWEEN, WHERE THEY DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY

02:06:23 IT IS GOING TO GO.

02:06:26 YOU CHARACTERIZE NEEL AS A HAWK, AND HE HAS BEEN, BUT IT

02:06:30 IS HARD TO PUT A REAL LABEL ON PEOPLE BECAUSE THERE ARE PEOPLE

02:06:34 WHO THINK WE DON'T HAVE TO DO MORE AND PROBABLY WON'T.

02:06:37 AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO THINK WE DON'T HAVE TO DO MORE AND

02:06:40 MAYBE WE WILL. HE FALLS INTO THAT LATTER

02:06:42 CATEGORY. NOT READY TO GIVE UP YET BUT

02:06:46 SAYING THAT WE NEED TO RAISE RATES AGAIN. LISA:

02:06:51 NOT MUCH ECONOMIC DATA THIS WEEK, BUT ON ANOTHER LEVEL WE

02:06:52 HAVE A LOT. $112 BILLION IN TREASURY

02:06:55 AUCTIONS. HOW IMPORTANT IS THAT FOR FED

02:07:01 OFFICIALS TO UNDERSTAND WHERE DEMAND STEPPED IN, WHERE PRICES

02:07:03 SEEM TO BE STABLE IN MARKETS AT THIS POINT? MIKE:

02:07:07 THE MARKETS ARE ALWAYS CLEAR. NEEL AND I WERE TALKING ABOUT

02:07:11 THAT, IT IS JUST ABOUT PRICE. WHAT DO PEOPLE THINK THEY WILL

02:07:17 HAVE TO PAY TO ABSORB ALL OF THIS PAPER?

02:07:21 WE ARE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT $330 BILLION IN TREASURIES, WE

02:07:23 HAVE CORPORATE AS WELL. WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO PAY FOR

02:07:26 THAT? AS YOU HEARD WHEN NEEL KASHKARI

02:07:34 WAS OUT HERE, THE FED DOES NOT THINK THAT FISCAL ISSUES ARE

02:07:35 REALLY WHAT IS DRIVING THE MARKET.

02:07:40 A DAY TO DAY ISSUE IN THE MARKETS, BUT PROBABLY MORE THE

02:07:45 STATE OF THE ECONOMY, WHERE THEY THINK THE FED WILL GO,

02:07:48 SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM WITH THE NEUTRAL RATE. LISA:

02:07:52 MICHAEL MCKEE, THANK YOU SO MUCH. I LOVED NEEL KASHKARI'S

02:07:57 DESCRIPTION OF TERM PREMIUM. PARSING THAT OUT IS SOMETHING

02:08:03 THAT IS A FEAT OF PHYSICS. JOINING US NOW IS GREGORY DACO.

02:08:10 I WANT TO START THERE, WITH THE QUESTION OF IS THE ECONOMY

02:08:14 TRULY SHOWING SIGNS OF SOFTENING TO THE DEGREE THAT

02:08:17 WOULD SUPPORT SOME OF THE MOVES THAT WE HAVE SEEN, BELIEF THAT

02:08:20 THE FED IS DONE, POISED FOR CUTS NEXT YEAR GREGORY:

02:08:26 I THINK WE ARE SEEING EVIDENCE THAT THE ECONOMY IS SLOWING.

02:08:29 THE LABOR MARKET HAS BEEN THE KEY PILLAR.

02:08:33 IT IS NOT THE RETRENCHMENT THAT WE SEE
