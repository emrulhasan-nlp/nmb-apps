Donald Trump is moving to consolidate power over the Republican Party, foreshadowing the loyalty he would demand in a potential second term, as he stands on the cusp of clinching his party’s presidential nomination.

Trump is ramping up efforts to bully Nikki Haley out of the race. His campaign mocked her after a stunning second-place finish in the Nevada primary in which he didn’t even compete. Trump is set to take all of the state’s delegates Thursday in a party caucus where the rules were engineered in his favor, following wins in Iowa and New Hampshire.
