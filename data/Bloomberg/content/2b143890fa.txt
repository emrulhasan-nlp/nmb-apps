The world’s biggest brands are reportedly spending hundreds of millions of dollars to associate themselves with the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. For those who can’t afford a full-on Olympic sponsorship, there’s an alternative.

Since the mid-2010s, at least, the World Anti-Doping Agency, which develops and coordinates policies for the Olympics and other events, has sought out commercial sponsors. For example, the Chinese company ANTA Sports has a three-year deal to provide WADA-branded apparel, according to the Associated Press. The brand also sponsors China’s national swimming team.
