00:15 Welcome to DAYBREAK, Australia. I'm Heidi Stroud.

00:16 What's in Sydney where markets have just come online?

00:21 I'm Annabel Jewel, as in Hong Kong. We're counting down to Asia's major

00:24 trading opens. And the top stories this hour, a

00:27 cautious start in store for Asia ahead of Australia's January inflation

00:31 numbers. Treasuries mixed in another busy session

00:34 of bond sales. New Zealand central bank is set to keep

00:38 rates on hold today, with traders on alert for any revised projections on

00:42 inflation and growth. Plus, Bloomberg reveals Apple is

00:48 canceling its decade long effort to develop an electric car.

00:54 Let's get you straight to this mid-week session and how we're setting up with

00:57 the staggered start to trading here in Sydney.

00:59 Looking pretty muted, about a 10th of 1% higher.

01:02 We are looking like a muted two positive open, though, here in Asia at a

01:07 reasonable handover from the US stocks. S&P 500 just nudging higher.

01:12 As Annabel mentioned, it is inflation in focus for Aussie traders.

01:16 Today we're about a 10th of a per cent higher.

01:18 At the start of that staggered session, we did see US stocks advancing even

01:22 after consumer confidence fell for the first time in four months.

01:25 We'll also be watching China stocks as well with the Golden Dragon Index

01:29 jumping in a fifth day of gains. We'll see if there's any pass through in

01:33 the Asian session today. Australian ten year use rising in early

01:37 trading. We did see treasuries trading pretty

01:39 mixed after $42 billion in an auction of seven year notes.

01:43 And it is a big week when it comes to that, a calendar of new corporate debt

01:48 issuance as well. The Aussie dollar is trading at 6546.

01:52 The dollar gauge has been kind of trading pretty steadily, but in

01:56 particular it's a yen that we're watching for around the best day in

01:59 nearly two years. After that, stronger than expected

02:02 inflation data really supporting these bets at the Bank of Japan potentially

02:06 has an earlier date in mind now for exiting its monetary policy settings.

02:11 Again, the dollar erasing that decline. We're seeing a pretty sort of rangebound

02:16 session ahead of the inflation numbers on Thursday and

02:20 really slate of Fed speak as well. Expected New Zealand is in focus.

02:24 Of course, it's about the BNZ today and there are a couple of sort of outliers

02:29 when it comes to expectations potentially of a move, but broadly they

02:32 are saying holds holding steady but potentially maintaining that the bias

02:37 towards maybe warning that more needs to be done.

02:40 Nick, futures up by about a 10th of 1% so.

02:45 You know, Heidi, just some breaking news here on CBC.

02:47 You could just see some of those headlines crossing there.

02:49 But their net income coming in for the fourth quarter.

02:52 This is for you earnings as well. But the fourth quarter net income coming

02:55 in at 1.62 billion SGD. That is a little bit softer than what

03:01 analysts had been expecting for $1.71 billion.

03:05 So a miss there for ICBC. They are expecting, though, to maintain

03:10 their 50% dividend patient payout ratio target for 2024.

03:15 There was a lot of focus on dividends given expectations of a strong 2023

03:20 performance. What else we're tracking in this is

03:25 their net interest rather than net. They're focused on NIMS and they're

03:30 expecting that range to be of 2.2 to 2.25% over the course of 2024.

03:36 They're also seeing low single digit loan growth over the course of next

03:40 year. That was as well another focus of these

03:43 earnings, given that the profits were looking to be driven more by that non

03:47 lending income, things like wealth fees, things like insurance as well.

03:51 And actually when you break it down, their non-interest income for the fourth

03:55 quarter period was $811 million. That makes up roughly half of the

04:00 overall income for the fourth quarter period.

04:04 Their final dividend, a share that's coming in at 42 Singapore cents.

04:09 So yes, that is the last of the Singapore major banks to report here

04:13 because we had the rivals DBS group UAB as well reporting full year earnings and

04:18 they were actually at all time highs. But as we said, ocbc's fourth quarter

04:22 net income, a little bit of a miss on what analysts had been expecting coming

04:26 in at $1.62 billion. Let's shift now.

04:31 Take a look at how US futures have come online here today because we are just

04:35 seeing, again, fairly flat. It's really been the trend over the

04:39 course of this week because a lot of that focus really is looking down to

04:44 that that preferred inflation gauge from the Fed.

04:48 What that's going to signal about this fight to get rates back to that or

04:51 interest inflation, rather, back to the 2% range.

04:55 And so it has really just been wait and see over the course of the few days, we

04:59 didn't really see too much of a direction in the prior session.

05:02 Actually, a lot of focus on corporate bond sales, but still little movement.

05:07 Otherwise, that is what we're seeing so far for the set up, Heidi.

05:11 Okay. Yeah, a bit of movement when it comes to

05:13 implied volatility for the Kiwi over the last 24 hours or so, but also suggesting

05:19 that we could see some fireworks, even though most economists are expecting New

05:23 Zealand central bank to keep rates on hold in the coming hours, but still

05:27 retaining that hawkish tone and inflation.

05:29 Let's bring Bloomberg economics. James MacIntyre here in Sydney.

05:32 So certainly markets are kind of expecting not a boring meeting.

05:37 Yeah, that's right. So there's a 25% chance of a rate hike

05:40 priced in by markets. And out of the 24 economists surveyed,

05:44 two are actually predicting a rate hike. We've seen coming into the meeting in

05:48 the lead up over the last few weeks and since the beginning of the year, the

05:51 RBNZ, it hasn't met since November last year, so it's been a three month break.

05:55 But we've seen communication from officials, governor or included, that

05:59 has been sounding particularly hawkish. So the stage is set for potentially an

06:04 interesting meeting. We think that ultimately they're going

06:06 to remain on hold at the meeting, though, where the focus might be or

06:10 where there might be some signs of potential, I guess, fireworks.

06:15 It's going to be more in their projections where they predict inflation

06:18 is going to be and their right track as well.

06:21 They had been at the November meeting suggesting that there was a chance that

06:25 further moves might be required. We don't think there's enough in the

06:29 data to suggest that they would need to deliver that today, but they might be

06:33 continuing to suggest that it's that future meetings April and May could be

06:38 could be live action. Yeah.

06:40 James, just give us a bit more context here, because your view is actually that

06:44 the RBNZ is going to be starting its easing cycle a little bit earlier than

06:48 what the bank is projecting itself. That's right.

06:52 So the bank is projecting a rate cycle beginning sometime towards the end of

06:57 this year. I think around the middle of the year is

07:00 probably a lot more likely. And so, you know, that data flow that

07:03 we've had over the last couple of months since the RBNZ has lost projections,

07:08 we've seen GDP undershoot, we've seen CPI undershoot their projections.

07:12 It's not the first time that that's happened.

07:15 And unemployment has been a little bit stronger.

07:17 And over on last week's data, we had a very, very dire retail sales outcome

07:23 that's showing that those rate hikes that they've delivered thus far, quite

07:26 aggressive, are really starting to flow through into the economy.

07:30 So in my view, is it we'll get to continue to see that evidence build.

07:33 And so it really will will sort of render this exercise today or the

07:38 communications that we're likely to see in being hawkish as being more of a

07:42 jawboning activity rather than an. The thing that that does that does

07:47 suggest that further hikes are coming soon.

07:50 That date is likely to unwind their ability to make those moves.

07:54 How well shielded is the New Zealand economy exposed?

07:57 To an extent, the Australian economy as well?

07:59 We were watching that CPI, reading from some of the global risks that we see,

08:03 particularly playing out potentially over the next year or two.

08:06 Yeah, I guess one of the key risks is, is concerns about inflation and war

08:13 potentially beginning or continuing these geopolitical tensions kind of

08:17 further slowing global trade and meaning some of that goods disinflation that we

08:21 had been seeing and has been benefiting and unflattering inflation over the last

08:27 few months, you know, kind of stopping for a little while and potentially

08:30 reversing course. New Zealand's definitely vulnerable to

08:32 that with very, very high import rate reliance, especially on on China.

08:37 So on on the other side, though, deflation out of China's factories is is

08:41 sort of helping to offset that that risk slightly.

08:44 I guess one of the big things and one of the surprises for the ANZ has been the

08:49 super strong surge in migration much, much faster than the BNZ and the New

08:53 Zealand Treasury was expecting. And that has been something that has

08:56 driven both in Australia and in New Zealand a bit of a demand surprise and

09:01 hence some of the hawkishness that we might be seeing.

09:04 My view is that that that catch up migration that we're seeing as we reopen

09:08 those borders and students all came in. It's a bit of a sugar rush and once we

09:12 get back to normal, we could see that move away very, very quickly.

09:15 And so I think, you know, on the on the demand side, there's a risk that the

09:20 strength in the economy that the ANZ might be a bit concerned about and is

09:23 worried might be continuing to put light a fire under those some of those

09:28 domestic inflation pressures which remain a problem.

09:30 And I think that that that that could actually the risk there is that it could

09:34 rapidly peter out and see the BNZ having to about face on rates quite quickly.

09:41 All right that was Bloomberg's James McIntyre there.

09:43 It's certainly a decision I'm going to be watching very, very closely later

09:46 today. But Apple shares as well.

09:48 They reversed their losses after Bloomberg revealed it's cancelling a

09:51 decade long effort to build an electric car, abandoning one of the tech giant's

09:56 most ambitious projects. For more, let's bring in our senior

09:59 executive editor for technology, Tom Giles in San Francisco.

10:02 And Tom, I mean, billions of dollars, thousands of

10:07 employees, years of work going into this.

10:11 Why did they pull away from this project?

10:15 Now, it's a decade long project. And you're right, they spent a lot of

10:19 money. Apple doesn't just walk away from big

10:21 projects like this. What what happened here is a realization

10:26 that electronic vehicles are really difficult.

10:30 You also have to recognize that other other manufacturers in this area,

10:34 including Tesla, are having a rough go of things, just declaring earlier this

10:41 year that that demand is going to decelerate in 2024 from from torrid

10:48 growth rates in past years. It's hard to do.

10:52 It's hard there's a lot of things that are that are working against the EV

10:55 industry right now, including supply chain, getting the supplies that you

11:00 need from where you need them at the time you need them.

11:03 That's challenging. Being able to manufacture a car at a

11:07 price point that the average consumer or even a somewhat well-to-do consumer can

11:12 afford that list. The the number of people able to do that

11:17 is also decreasing. And then lastly, you have another big

11:20 challenge, which is the charging infrastructure.

11:22 There are still people who are worried about will I be able to get home from

11:27 where I'm driving to, will even be able to get to where I'm driving to without

11:32 the right infrastructure in place? Will there be a charging station when I

11:36 need it? Will I be able to access it at the time

11:39 that I need it? Those are all questions that all of

11:42 these EV makers are asking right now. And that's that's the calculus that

11:47 Apple needed to make. And Tom, as you've just been speaking

11:52 about, it's not as though the competitors are having an easy time of

11:54 it either. We did see a pretty saucy response from

11:58 Elon Musk. Do we have any kind of leaders in this

12:02 area or is there a more likelihood of consolidation, do you think, going

12:06 forward? Well, Tesla, as you know, took an early

12:09 lead in this area and they have the advantage.

12:12 They have an early mover advantage in this regard.

12:15 This is a business they built their business on EVs.

12:20 For Apple, it would be a major pivot. This is not what they.

12:23 They're great at supply chain. They're great at consumer electronics.

12:27 They've talked about the idea of a car being kind of this mobile, this big

12:33 mobile phone. But this is not the area that they are

12:37 strong in. They are strong in handheld devices, not

12:41 in terms of making these big vehicles and putting all of the infrastructure

12:45 behind that in terms of the rest of the industry.

12:47 You're even see, you know, Detroit automakers have also struggled to get

12:52 the right balance when it comes to electronic vehicles.

12:55 You're seeing them pivot more in the direction of hybrids, for example,

12:59 giving consumers a little bit more choice, giving them a little bit more

13:03 flexibility, coming in at the right price point, coming in with all of the

13:08 specified specifications lined up in a way that enables you to produce these on

13:14 a mass scale. That's just not something that Apple had

13:17 quite figured out. And they also remember they pivoted

13:21 they've pivoted a lot with this particular product, making changes in

13:26 personnel, making change, missing deadlines, pushing back a time of launch

13:31 until a few years from now, they had hoped to be much, much further along

13:35 than they were right now. And I think they made the realization

13:39 it's time to cut bait. It's such a great scoop that we got here

13:45 because we got really a lot of details on the disclosure internally.

13:49 And we understand that those resources are now being shifted to generative AI.

13:53 So what sort of projects are we expecting?

13:55 And at least from a market perspective, it seems like this is being interpreted

13:59 as sort of a good move, a positive move, right?

14:03 Any time you can, you know, get a sense that Apple is making the hard choices

14:07 that it needs to make in order to put resources in areas where it can make a

14:12 big difference. Artificial intelligence, Generative

14:15 artificial intelligence. Remember, we talk a lot about the

14:19 advances that are being made by Openai, Microsoft, Google, Metta, the owner of

14:25 Facebook, is getting a lot of credit for its approach to building that large

14:29 language model, making it open source. All of these big tech companies that

14:34 Apple competes with. And there is a sense that Apple has not

14:38 made as many inroads, is not as far along, is a bit of a laggard when it

14:43 comes to generative A.I.. We're not talking about any kind of chat

14:48 coming from Apple. So what kind of difference are they

14:51 going to make? How can they weave this into their

14:54 consumer electronics that we use every day that have changed the way we live,

14:58 play, work? That's what Apple needs to answer.

15:01 And so you're going to see some of these people who were working on this this

15:05 project moving in that direction. Also, remember Vision Pro, they've just

15:10 introduced a new VR AR headset. 30 $500 price point.

15:15 People who've used it generally are liking it, but that is not a price point

15:20 that is going to make the general public come out in mass.

15:24 So they've really got a they've really got to make good on generative AI Vision

15:28 Pro and keep demand up for their existing product line.

15:32 That's where Apple needs to concentrate its efforts.

15:36 I was a tech executive editor, Tom Giles there in San Francisco on that story of

15:40 winding down its electric car effort. We are also getting some news when it

15:45 comes to the antitrust woes for the company.

15:48 Representatives from Apple met with the Justice Department last week in a final

15:52 bid to persuade the agency not to file an antitrust suit against the company.

15:56 That's according to people familiar with the matter.

15:58 They've been probing Apple since 2019. And we are hearing that they met with

16:03 Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter.

16:05 He'll be making that final call on whether or not to file a suit.

16:09 These last Rites meetings are often one of the last steps before a lawsuit is a

16:13 file. So they're alleging, of course, that

16:15 Apple imposed software and hardware limitations on their devices to impede

16:20 rivals from effectively competing. Coming up next hour, we'll be talking

16:25 more about tech stocks as well as broader market strategy with Global X,

16:29 why they think the outlook for equities remains positive.

16:33 This is Bloomberg.

16:48 You're watching Bloomberg Daybreak Australia here just kicking off with a

16:52 pretty big milestone actually, that came through for the Hong Kong and Chinese

16:55 stocks yesterday because we saw the Hang Seng gauge actually erasing its year to

17:00 date losses here. This chart taking a look at the

17:03 momentum. So both on a price gains basis, but also

17:06 momentum basis. This is the biggest reopening or rally,

17:10 rather, we've seen or second to the reopening one, but still quite

17:15 significant in that context because we haven't seen these sort of gains now for

17:19 for several months. If you change on take a look at the

17:21 other chart here. You can see the Hang Seng China

17:23 Enterprises index in more detail here, closing up 1.5% in yesterday.

17:28 As I said, that takes out the year to date losses.

17:32 We're back now to the levels of November of last year, but let's get some more

17:36 analysis with Rohan Reddy. He's vice president and director of

17:40 research at Global X. And Rohan, let's kick it off with with

17:44 China stocks. I know you're a little bit cautious

17:46 here, but would you be joining any sort of investors in that interest that we're

17:50 now seeing a little bit more in mainland equities?

17:54 I do think there's a real bull case right now for some of the Chinese stocks

17:58 in the short term, just because of some of the data that we saw from the Lunar

18:02 New Year and a lot of consumer spending, which was previously a cause for concern

18:06 because there was some challenges and where consumers were actually spending

18:10 some of their capital. But we do think that at least in the

18:13 short term, there could be a real case on the bull side for a lot of mainland

18:17 Chinese equities just because of the regulatory reforms that the government

18:21 has started to introduce, and also the fact that if they can effectively

18:25 implement the stimulus, which they've spoken about but not really been super

18:29 clear on some of the details on that might alleviate some of the fears right

18:33 now in the market. And right now, a lot of Chinese mainland

18:36 equities, it feels like they're heavily discounted, at least from a multiples

18:40 perspective. So that might introduce a little bit

18:43 more of a price appreciation just from a fair value multiple standpoint.

18:48 And are there any sectors or or areas that you'd be looking to invest in in

18:53 particular? We still really like the Chinese

18:57 consumer a lot because there is this long term secular bull case that we do

19:03 believe even beyond just what's going on in the short term, the middle class is

19:07 driving a lot of what gains in the Chinese economy are starting to feel.

19:11 And so right now, moving away from that old economy sectors and moving towards

19:17 more of the newer economy sectors, those are some of the areas that we're guiding

19:21 clients towards. So if you look at manufacturing and PMI

19:24 data, for example, that's really been contracting and been an area of concern

19:28 lately. So we do feel that moving away from some

19:32 of those very cyclical segments of the market and more towards where a lot of

19:37 the economy is moving in China, that's where investors can really capitalize

19:41 on. You've already started to see that in

19:43 the beauty segment and also at some of the lunar New Year spending.

19:46 So we think some of the parts of what needs to materialize is already

19:50 occurring for the consumer. Sorry.

19:54 Geopolitics is the overlay that looms large and will get ever more significant

19:59 as we get into the end of the year. Do you think that's an added risk for

20:03 China assets? Yes.

20:06 This is the looming overhang that we see from a lot of Chinese stocks, not just

20:11 on the mainland, but even for overseas, too.

20:13 And so this is part of the reason why a lot of investors have remained cautious.

20:18 If you actually look at ETF fund flows, a lot of Chinese funds are experiencing

20:22 outflows, whereas in China funds, those are the ones experiencing inflows.

20:27 So it is sending a signal that we do think regulatory overhang is part of the

20:32 concern. And that is also part of what explains

20:35 some of the discounts and multiples that we are seeing within some of those

20:38 mainland equities. So we do think that right now you should

20:42 be at least somewhat cautious about Chinese stocks overall.

20:46 But in the short term, as we've seen with the rally, there could be a little

20:50 bit of a profit taking case to be had. But at least for the foreseeable future,

20:54 really, unless the Chinese government starts to implement some clear reforms

21:00 and also be able to effectively implement stimulus measures, that's why

21:04 you're seeing some of the discounted multiples.

21:08 Let's talk about the rest of Asia. Japan obviously has been such a popular

21:13 trade. Do you see that being replicated in

21:16 terms of finding value in South Korea as well?

21:21 Yes, And we really like for as many of the challenges that we have seen in

21:25 China recently, we have seen a lot of investors migrate towards Japan on the

21:30 international side, just because it feels like a much more stable market.

21:34 It's had 34 year highs on the Nikkei index.

21:37 And there is this really long term structural peace that's occurring with

21:41 the Japanese market where you're starting to see a lot of corporate

21:44 reforms lead to market gains. And we do think that there is a similar

21:48 story in Korea that could occur because you do see these ownership issues and a

21:54 lot of value that could be unlocked. You could see even some additional IPO's

21:58 in the Korean market. So we think that a lot of the playbook

22:01 that's actually been implemented in the Japanese market, if it starts to filter

22:06 towards the Korean market, which has some overlap in the way that that market

22:10 is structured, that could actually lead to more premium multiples for some of

22:15 those stocks, but also a lot of value that could be unlocked for shareholders.

22:18 So that is an area that we see as more of a focus for the rest of 2024 for

22:24 international investors. Brian, great to have you with us.

22:28 Rohan Reddy, vice president and director of research at Global X.

22:32 Much more to come here on DAYBREAK, Australia.

22:34 This is Bloomberg. And our financial system.

22:41 Pretty much everybody follows the same set of rules.

22:46 I'm talking banks and credit unions and credit card companies, gold traders and

22:51 stock brokers. Private equity now has to follow the

22:56 rules. Precious metal dealers.

22:58 Venmo. Western Union,

23:01 but not crypto. My view of the world is same kind of

23:06 activity, same kind of risk, should have the same regulation.

23:13 That was the US Senator Elizabeth Warren there, someone we know who's been quite

23:17 a critic of the crypto industry overall, but also someone calling for regulation

23:20 we just heard there. Taking a look at what we're seeing,

23:23 Bitcoin prices here trading above $57,000, quite a big move high we've

23:29 seen over the course of this week. We're back at more than two year highs

23:32 at this point and the overall value of the cryptocurrency industry or market

23:37 has now jumped to around $2 trillion. That's the first time as well in almost

23:42 two years. So it is that focus on that ETF fueled

23:45 rally.

23:59 How do you assess recession come in 2023?

24:03 Like many predicted, global growth would have been thrown off track was there are

24:10 risks to our outlook. America's growth has consistently

24:15 exceeded projections. In short, America's path to a soft

24:20 landing has underpinned global growth. That was the US Treasury Secretary,

24:29 Janet Yellen, in Brazil ahead of meetings with their counterparts from

24:32 G20 countries and a draft of the G20 closing statement seen by Bloomberg News

24:38 says the global economy also has a growing chance of pulling off a soft

24:41 landing. But Yellen is flagging the downside

24:44 risks to the global outlook for monetary tightening.

24:47 And really those views from Janet Yellen sort of underscoring what's been the big

24:51 focus point for markets this week. Last week we were all about earnings.

24:55 This week we're really all about the numbers and what we're going to get out

24:58 of that economic data. We've been speaking across the course of

25:01 this week. We've got that Fed's preferred inflation

25:04 gauge that's due later. Is that going to still show inflationary

25:08 pressures that perhaps could be a little bit resurgent in the economy?

25:11 We've definitely seen that repricing from investors already.

25:14 So that expectation now we're going to see 75 basis points of cuts over the

25:18 course of 2024. That very much brings it back in line

25:21 with what's the projection from the Fed instead.

25:25 So that sort of sets the tone over the course of this week.

25:27 It's wait and see. It's that focus on the economy.

25:30 And, Heidi, it's really back to all being about central banks here.

25:35 It is especially ahead of the inflation numbers we're expecting out of Australia

25:39 in the US. Lots of Fed speakers.

25:41 Will that kind of original repricing of expectations there.

25:45 And NZ Bank is expecting a rate hike from the RBA, ANZ in their decision

25:50 that's due out in the coming hours and that goes against consensus in a

25:53 Bloomberg survey. Most economists overwhelmingly expecting

25:56 a hole. Let's bring in Sharon Zollner is a chief

25:59 and New Zealand economist at ANZ Bank who's one of our top ranked economists

26:03 and certainly one of the most accurate when it comes to the ANZ.

26:07 Sharon, always great to have you with us and I love that we have you on to talk

26:09 about your contrarian call. Why do you think the ANZ will go today?

26:15 And I suppose that the question is if they feel that there is a necessity

26:19 potentially to do more, should they just do it today?

26:24 Well, that's what it boils down to. But we can only see the unders and overs

26:27 in the data. It's been pretty mixed.

26:29 There's no one smoking gun you can point to.

26:32 Monetary policy is clearly working. So that is, of course, what most people

26:36 acknowledge. But as you look at what the Reserve Bank

26:38 said in November, they basically they showed a forecast of the official cash

26:42 rate. They had 19 basis points of tightening.

26:45 So practically a full hike in there. So our taking is that our take out of

26:49 that was that they do need just a nudge rather than a big shove.

26:52 And since then, we've had unemployment that didn't rise nearly as much as they

26:56 thought. We've had the non-tradable domestic

26:58 inflation that didn't fall nearly as much as that as they expected had

27:03 migration a bit stronger. So overall, the picture is still things

27:06 going their way, but just too slowly. They've also revised up their estimate

27:11 of the neutral official cash rate by 50 basis points since like cold since I

27:15 last hiked in May last year. So it's sort of just the story of the

27:19 wheels slipping a little bit of of the risk of inflation staying too high for

27:23 too long and the risk of inflation undershooting the target really becoming

27:27 quite out of whack. And so you can run with that for a while

27:31 and hope for the best. But our take is that the Reserve Bank's

27:34 patience is running cent and if not today, then so unless the tone of the

27:39 data changes quickly, there is something I guess

27:44 counterintuitive on the face of resetting rate hikes when GDP is down,

27:50 particularly to the degree of growth slowing that we see for New Zealand, do

27:55 you think that's still, I guess, a worthwhile cost benefit here?

28:01 Well, essentially the Reserve Bank doesn't have a growth target.

28:04 They're interested in growth in terms of how it's running relative to potential.

28:08 So what's the output gap, basically? Is there a lot of spare capacity in the

28:13 economy or are things quite stretched? Things were obviously absurdly stretched

28:16 during the period because the border was closed and we couldn't bring in workers

28:19 and everybody wanted to stop since they couldn't all of the same things as

28:23 globally. And that has changed a lot.

28:26 But what we have seen in the last three months is that the direct indicators of

28:30 capacity, the most important, is unemployment.

28:32 But there's a bunch of them. There have been really mixed, actually.

28:34 So it's not the slam dunk that the Reserve Bank would have expected in

28:39 terms of showing that capacity is opening up and that therefore

28:44 inflation's going to fall in a reasonable time frame.

28:47 This there's a question marks around it, surprisingly.

28:51 So I'm interested. You mentioned immigration or migration.

28:56 How significant a risk is that to to. It's inflation.

28:59 And also we're going to get these updated projections.

29:00 So what are we sort of expecting on how fast inflation should be receding then?

29:06 Well, immigration is a two sided coin. On the one hand, it's a surge of

29:10 workers. We have imported a massive number of

29:13 people for the size of our economy. Population growth is running at nearly

29:16 3%. So that's a lot more workers.

29:19 And certainly questions like in surveys, is it easy to find workers that that's

29:23 just turned around turn on a dime? But of course, all these people need

29:27 somewhere to live and they need health care and education and all these other

29:30 things. And the Reserve Bank estimates that it

29:32 is a net positive for inflation. And so we would view those two positive

29:37 surprises that we've had on the migration is likely to to add to the

29:41 Reserve Bank sees that the jobs facing them is is a little bit bigger rather

29:46 than smaller. Sorry, what was your second question?

29:51 Inflation projections and and I think as well like how quickly that's going to

29:55 we're going to see inflation starting to recede for instance, from our own team

29:58 at Bloomberg Economics. They're saying that they actually

30:01 expected to to start to recede faster than what the ANZ says.

30:06 Yeah. In our forecast, it's it's slower and

30:08 that's because of the stickiness of the domestic inflation.

30:11 So we really do need to put aside the noise and the tradable inflation.

30:17 The Reserve Bank does focus on that domestic inflation and the wage pressure

30:20 and the capacity pressures, those sorts of inflation that is stickier.

30:24 And it's also that they have the most control over and that is where the

30:28 stickiness has been essentially since my last year that domestic inflation has

30:32 fallen at half the pace basically that the Reserve Bank had expected.

30:37 And I mean, if you extrapolate that out, we're going to be back at Target

30:40 sometime in 2030 or something. You know, it is a question of of is

30:45 incremental progress sufficient, that is inflation making itself at home in the

30:51 meantime. And there's just a few pieces of data

30:53 suggesting that is the case. When you look at things, the proportion

30:56 of firms intending to raise their prices, how much they're intending to

30:59 raise their prices, the distribution of large wage increases, these things are

31:03 all flattening out at levels that are not consistent with the inflation

31:08 target. That could just be a question of legs

31:10 and just why let things go and let them run?

31:14 But the issue is for the Reserve Bank. They estimate they're already about

31:17 three quarters of the way through the direction that previous tightening will

31:21 have delivered. And if you put it off, then you'll end

31:24 up having to go much higher with rates for much longer and actually causing

31:28 more pain than if you had just gotten on with it.

31:31 So yes, hiking would be risky, but not hiking is a risky option too.

31:35 There aren't any low risk options at this point,

31:39 I can say in your notes. So you're saying if they don't hike in

31:41 February, then they're going to be hiking in April.

31:43 But do you think that if they do hike today, do you think that's the last one

31:46 for the current cycle? Well, April, maybe May.

31:50 The issue with April is that we don't get any more CPI data until after that

31:54 meeting because we only have quarterly inflation data in New Zealand.

31:58 And that's think is that if you just think you're 25 points from where you

32:01 need to be, then you're just out of the gate.

32:03 But we we suspect that the Reserve Bank passed that point some time ago that to

32:08 go through all the rigmarole of restarting hiking cycle, particularly

32:13 into a weakening economy, it's a big deal and you're not really going to do

32:17 it unless you think have your two hikes away from where you need to be.

32:21 We've got an example of this in the 2000 cycle, three times the Reserve Bank all

32:25 in a longer each time and restarted hiking, delivering at least twice each

32:30 time. And 2007 the Reserve Bank of New Zealand

32:33 delivered four last hikes as the helm. Of course, then the global financial

32:38 crisis came along and that was the end of that.

32:42 Bye, Sharon. Thanks for your time this morning.

32:44 Sharon's over there. As we said, one of the two economists

32:47 that is seeing a hike from the RBA, ANZ, and that decision is due in just under 2

32:51 hours from now. So that was the chief New Zealand

32:53 economist at ANZ Bank. And you can also turn to your Bloomberg

32:57 for more on this decision. Go to t live, go to get commentary and

33:00 analysis from Bloomberg's expert editors.

33:02 We'll have a series of commentary running on that decision.

33:05 As we said, counting down to it. It's 9 a.m.

33:08 hong kong time. So just under actually an hour and 20

33:11 minutes from now. Moorhead, this is Bloomberg.

33:27 You're watching DAYBREAK, Australia. Here are some of the geopolitical

33:30 headlines that we're tracking this morning.

33:32 And Lebanon's Hezbollah militants will reportedly stop firing on Israel if

33:37 Hamas agrees to a proposed proposal for a truce with Israel in Gaza.

33:41 But sources have told Reuters that if Israel continues to shell Lebanon, then

33:46 Hezbollah will keep fighting. The militant group in Israel have been

33:49 locked in a cycle of attacks since October, stoking fears of a wider

33:53 conflict. A top Pentagon official says the U.S.

33:58 has hit 230 targets in Yemen since last month.

34:02 It's the most detailed public accounting of the airstrikes so far as Washington

34:06 seeks to deter Houthi attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea.

34:10 Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary Daniel SHAPIRO also says U.S.

34:14 forces intercepted ships carrying lethal aid from Iran to the houses.

34:21 U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is

34:23 calling on G7 nations to use frozen Russian assets to aid Ukraine.

34:28 Speaking in Brazil, Yellen said there's a strong legal, economic and moral case

34:33 to unlock the value of the assets worth billions of dollars.

34:37 G7 members are exploring the way forward as Ukraine's funding needs grow and the

34:42 war with Russia grinds into a third year.

34:46 And the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has pitched his peace formula

34:50 for ending Russia's invasion. In a meeting with Saudi Crown Prince

34:54 Mohammed bin Salman. Cave is looking for support for its

34:58 plan, which requires Russian forces to withdraw from all Ukrainian territory.

35:03 That's something Moscow is refusing to do.

35:06 Ukraine is running short of ammunition as U.S.

35:09 aid remains stalled in Congress. Well, as the conflict with Russia

35:16 continues, Ukraine's allies are now said to be starting to think of the

35:19 consequences of a Russian victory. Let's discuss the end game scenarios

35:23 with a Bloomberg Russia economist, Alexander Isakov and our chief economics

35:28 analyst, Jennifer. Well.

35:29 So, Jeremy, start off with you first. And obviously there is gaming going on

35:34 in terms of some of these alternate scenarios.

35:36 Given how much has changed in the past year as we enter this third year of the

35:41 conflict, how do you assess the state of the war?

35:46 Thanks so much, Heidi. Yes, As we're entering the third year of

35:49 the war, Russia appears to have gained the initiative with Ukraine facing

35:53 ammunition and manpower shortfalls and continues to lead in additional Western

35:57 aid. Meetings were held here in Washington at

35:59 the White House to try and break that deadlock on U.S.

36:02 aid. It doesn't appear that they've reached a

36:04 solution any time soon. All that means that Ukraine's partners

36:08 are concerned that Russia's odds of securing even a partial victory might be

36:13 the highest they've been since the earliest days of its invasion.

36:16 To be clear, Ukraine is not showing any signs of backing down and remains clear.

36:22 It's going to maintain the fight against Russia.

36:24 But if there continued delays in Western aid, if momentum really remains on

36:29 Russia's side, Ukraine could face this impossible choice of either fighting

36:34 against the odds or approaching a favorable negotiation over some sort of

36:38 settlement. Yeah, And Alex, as as Jennifer said,

36:45 this is really bad since the start of the invasion.

36:48 The most it was saying that that Russia possibly could have some sort of win

36:53 here. What would that mean for Moscow?

36:58 Yes. For the scenario of Russia's partial

37:02 victory, which we explore with Jennifer, we see that Russia will actually have

37:06 failed to achieve its original maximalist objectives, maximum of just

37:11 political objectives, but it will also see some of the sanctions lifted.

37:17 We don't see a world where Russia is free from technological or export

37:21 control sanctions, and it will actually remain starved of access to new

37:26 technology. Still, we see that Russia will likely

37:29 see more exports to Europe and some of the energy exports removed from the

37:34 country. And again, we see that some of the

37:37 losses Russia suffered will be permanent.

37:40 We don't see a world where Russia continues to or goes back to supplying

37:45 almost half of Europe's natural gas. So that is probably a permanent hit to

37:50 Russia. Alex, what are the implications for

37:55 Ukraine in the case of Deface? And I guess what are the security

37:58 implications for that region? I think for Ukraine, it's actually

38:05 pretty hard to exaggerate the cost of even a partial Russian win.

38:10 Those Ukrainians who will leave outside the Russian controlled territories,

38:14 outside their Russian lines, will find it pretty hard to rebuild the country.

38:20 We see that in this scenario. The capital inflows into the country

38:25 will grow increasingly scarce and Ukraine's allies and donors will see

38:32 financial fatigue and will probably gradually decrease the amount of

38:37 financial aid to the country. So the largest cost is probably will be

38:43 ultimately in that some of the 6 million people who actually fled Ukraine in the

38:48 last two years will see less incentive to return in the country.

38:54 That is this year's limited economic growth and the high risk of another

38:59 conflict. Jen, as the war really goes into its

39:07 third year, we're just seeing it becoming increasingly politicized,

39:11 perhaps in the U.S.. How is the outcome of the the invasion

39:16 likely to affect Washington? I think that's exactly right.

39:21 And I think it's really important to remind viewers here that even though

39:25 this is a conflict, that in terms of its geography is largely regional, the

39:30 implications of it are truly global, including for U.S.

39:33 interests and including for how U.S. allies and partners around the world, as

39:37 well as U.S. rivals, are going to take lessons away

39:39 from the ultimate outcome of this conflict.

39:42 I think in particular, if we are envisioning a scenario in which Russia

39:46 achieves even a partial victory and lack of U.S.

39:50 support or a shortfall in U.S. support is seen as a potential reason

39:53 behind that. A lot of U.S.

39:55 allies and partners around the world are going to think twice about whether the

39:58 U.S. is a reliable partner that could leave

40:01 some of them to head towards us rivals. It could lead them to be less attentive

40:07 to Washington's interests when it comes to other policy priorities.

40:10 And I think especially if you're thinking about U.S.

40:12 rivals from China to Iran to North Korea, they're likely to interpret this

40:17 as a sign of declining Western and in particular declining U.S.

40:21 power that could lead some leaders around the world to be emboldened to

40:25 think that they, too, could use military force to pursue their interests, to

40:30 reserve to resolve some of the conflicts that they have around the world.

40:34 And paradoxically, we could be looking at a situation in which the end of this

40:38 war, however unbalanced or however impermanent it might be, could actually

40:43 open up the door to more international conflict,

40:47 the potential embodiment of Beijing when it comes to Taiwan.

40:51 Is that a scenario that you've been looking very closely at?

40:54 But I do wonder if there is a change in the US leadership.

40:58 Have you been sort of wargaming the scenarios under which we have another

41:02 presidency for Donald Trump and what that means not just for this conflict,

41:06 but of course, also the war in Gaza and I guess how he deals with this stretch

41:10 to bandwidths of security commitments that the United States has going right

41:15 now. Well, that's certainly a key question

41:18 for us here. I think it's also a key question on a

41:21 lot of countries minds. We're seeing this in particular being

41:23 discussed quite a bit in Europe, including most recently at the Munich

41:27 Security Conference, where leaders were talking about what Europe's future looks

41:31 like if they cannot rely on the United States.

41:33 If former President Trump is reelected, follows through on some of the things he

41:38 said in the past in terms of withdrawing from NAITO or not upholding NATO's

41:42 commitments to partners who aren't meeting their defense spending goals.

41:47 I think that's leading partners in Europe to think more about how they

41:50 increase their defense spending and become a little bit more

41:52 self-sufficient. I think it's leading partners not just

41:55 in Europe, but around the world, to think about what are former President

41:59 Trump's interests going to be, how they be able to align with that.

42:02 For example, working more with the United States on trying to show that

42:06 there's an alignment there. But I think this is going to be a

42:08 looming question over the next months leading up to the election.

42:11 And many partners around the world do see that there would be significant

42:15 differences in these two candidates approaches to the rest of the world.

42:22 But that was Bloomberg's Russia economist

42:25 Alexander Isakov and now chief economics analyst Jennifer Welsh.

42:29 They're just really talking about those scenarios.

42:31 What if Putin wins thinking the unimaginable?

42:34 But be sure to tune in to Bloomberg Radio to hear more from today's big

42:37 newsmakers and get in-depth analysis from the Bloomberg Daybreak team

42:41 broadcasting live from studio in Hong Kong.

42:44 You can listen via the app radio plus or Bloomberg Radio dot com, but I have

42:48 plenty more ahead. This is Bloomberg.

43:05 Okay. Shares of ABC are going to be in focus

43:08 when trading opens in Singapore in another hour from now, but that's after

43:13 a reported fourth quarter net income that missed the average analyst

43:16 estimate. For more, let's bring in Bloomberg

43:18 Intelligence senior analyst Sarah Jane Mahmoud in Singapore.

43:22 And Sara, just kick us off. It was a little bit of a miss here at

43:26 the headline level, but what were some of the highlights from the report as

43:30 well? Thank you.

43:33 So, yes, we did report a very strong set of results for 2023, despite missing

43:39 consensus estimates on weaker than expected fee income.

43:43 And total income actually did reach a record high in 2023.

43:47 And this is chiefly off the back of strong net interest income growth due to

43:52 the Fed rate hikes over the past couple of years.

43:55 And the strong performance is reflected in a higher dividend for 2023,

43:59 reflecting a 53% payout ratio. Yeah.

44:04 So what do we expect then, when it comes to any kind of guidance for or forecast

44:09 for 2024. Sorry.

44:13 Yeah. I think 2024 is going to have its own

44:16 challenges. And, you know, with the growth in wealth

44:19 management in both Greater China and in Singapore, ICBC is very well positioned

44:25 to gain from tailwinds and growth in both of those regions.

44:29 So it is likely to see an uptick in fee income going through the course of this

44:34 year. Loan growth is likely to stay relatively

44:36 weak, particularly in Singapore, and we are likely to see some margin

44:41 compression, just quite modest I think, in the first half of this year on rising

44:46 cost of funds. And then second half of the expected Fed

44:49 rate cuts. What about the M&A outlook?

44:54 Because that's something that's helped DBS and you obey that Icbc's peers in

44:59 Singapore. I helped them along.

45:01 So is that something we're also expecting?

45:05 Yeah. I mean, OCP has been engaging in M&A,

45:09 perhaps less high profile than that. If you OPI and DP s is in the process at

45:15 the moment of acquiring Commonwealth Bank of Australia's business unit in

45:19 Indonesia and also at MetLife in Malaysia.

45:22 And I think this all goes to its strategic priorities of gathering growth

45:28 in ASEAN and in Greater China and hoping to capitalize on growth in World Cup,

45:33 growth in wealth income and also growth in trade flows between ASEAN and Greater

45:38 China over the next 2 to 3 years. And I think also ICBC has a much

45:44 stronger capital position than its peers, DBS and UAB.

45:49 And this does put it in a very good position to engage in further M&A over

45:53 the mid to long term should the right opportunity arise, I think is what a

45:59 Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst for the Southeast Asian Bank, Sarah Jane

46:03 Mahmoud there in Singapore. Take a look at some of the stocks to
