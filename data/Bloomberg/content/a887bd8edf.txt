Democrat Tom Suozzi won the race to succeed ousted New York congressman George Santos , retaking a seat he previously held and narrowing the GOP’s razor-thin majority in the US House of Representatives.

Suozzi’s victory over Republican Mazi Pilip in the Queens and Long Island swing district offers a template for Democrats to successfully fend of GOP attacks over the border, after he seized on Republican lawmakers’ rejection of a bipartisan immigration bill. Suozzi, who held the seat for three terms until last year, led Pilip 53.9% to 46.1% with 93% of the votes counted, according to the Associated Press.
