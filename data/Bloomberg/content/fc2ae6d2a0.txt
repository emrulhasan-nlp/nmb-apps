Ukraine’s agricultural exporters have left around $3 billion of their revenues overseas since Russia invaded the country, adding to the pressure on the nation’s foreign exchange reserves, according to central bank estimates seen by Bloomberg News.

That is 70% to 75% of what traders from various industries have kept outside Ukraine since the start of the war, a government official said, citing calculations from the National Bank of Ukraine. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity as the data isn’t public.
