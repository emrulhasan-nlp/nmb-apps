00:14 >> WHAT WE EXPECT TO GET FROM PAYROLLS IS FROM THE HOT PRINT

00:16 WE SAW LAST MONTH.

00:19 >> I THINK THE LABOR MARKET HELD UP JUST FINE.

00:23 A TOUCH STRONGER.

00:28 >> I THINK IT WOULD BE A SOUND NUMBER AND IT WOULD BE 250,000.

00:33 >> THERE'S POTENTIAL FOR THE ECONOMY TO GROW FASTER THAN

00:34 EXPECTED.

00:35 >> ANOTHER REALLY STRONG FEBRUARY, HISTORY COULD REPEAT

00:42 AGAIN.

00:43 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE

00:46 WITH JONATHAN FERRO, LISA ABRAMOWICZ AND ANNMARIE HORDERN.

00:49 JONATHAN: LISA TOLD ME OFF LAST TIME WE

00:51 DID THIS, LET'S GET TO THE WEEKEND.

00:53 I WILL START EVERY HOUR WITH THAT.

01:00 LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY, GOOD MORNING FOR AUDIENCE WORLDWIDE.

01:05 IT IS PAYROLLS FRIDAY, EQUITY FUTURES ON THE S&P 500 POSITIVE

01:07 BY .1%. THE MOST IMPORTANT PAYROLLS

01:13 PRINT SINCE THE LAST ONE, UNTIL THE NEXT ONE.

01:18 WILL A DOUBLE DOWN ON THE BOOMING 353,000 OF LAST MONTH.

01:21 LISA: WE ARE POSITIONED FOR HEADS I

01:27 WIN, TAILS I WIN, ULTIMATELY NO ONE IS BETTING ON A

01:31 RE-ACCELERATING INFLATION GROWTH AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE

01:33 EXPECTING FROM THE PAYROLLS REPORT.

01:37 >> 200 K IS THE ESTIMATE THIS MORNING.

01:40 WE'VE HAD THE ADP, THE SERVICES COMPONENT, THE EMPLOYMENT

01:45 COMPONENT. NONE OF IT WAS THIS BIG BLOWOUT

01:49 UPSIDE SURPRISE THAT WE ALL FEARED A FEW WEEKS AGO.

01:53 >> I WAS GOING THROUGH THIS AND EVERY TIME I KEPT KICKING

01:57 MYSELF EVERYTHING ABOUT THE DATA HAS BEEN GOLDILOCKS.

02:02 IT'S THE REASON WHY PEOPLE ARE PRICING OUT THE IDEA OF

02:06 RE-INFLATING THE ECONOMY OR TRUE REAL WEAKNESS EITHER.

02:09 IT'S BASICALLY WHAT EVERYONE WANTED TO SEE.

02:14 >> ANOTHER WEEK OF GAINS. WE NEED TO HEAD DOWN TO

02:16 WASHINGTON DC IN A FEW MONTHS. CATCHING UP WITH BLOOMBERG'S

02:18 AND MARIE. THE SAVE THE UNION TAKING AIM

02:21 AT TRUMP TALKING ABUT HIS PREDECESSOR WITHOUT MENTIONING

02:24 HIS NAME. IS THIS GOOD TO BE THE APPROACH

02:28 TO THE ELECTION LATER THIS YEAR? LISA: HE'S NOT TO MENTION TRUMP

02:32 WINNING. ALSO NOT TO MENTION ABORTION

02:34 RIGHTS WITH REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM IS THE NEW CATCHPHRASE

02:38 AS WELL. HE'S SETTING IT UP AS WE ARE

02:43 THE ALTERNATIVE NOT NECESSARILY MAKING A TRUE PITCH ABOUT A NEW

02:49 VISION HE HAS TALKED ABOUT NEW IDEAS BUT IT'S DOUBLING DOWN ON

02:52 WHAT HE'S DONE SAYING I'M BETTER THAN THE OTHER GUY.

02:55 JONATHAN: LET'S GO THROUGH THOSE STATS

03:01 TOGETHER.

03:02 800,000 NEW MANUFACTURING JOBS IN AMERICA AND COUNTING.

03:04 UNEMPLOYMENT AT 50 YEAR LOWS. DO ANY OF THOSE STATS RESONATE

03:08 WITH AMERICANS RIGHT NOW. LISA: THEY ARE STARTING TO RESONATE

03:14 MORE BUT ESSENTIALLY THE ANSWER IS NO AND IT SIMPLY BECAUSE OF

03:17 ACCUMULATIVE INFLATION HAS BEEN TOO MUCH TO OVERWHELM.

03:21 THIS IS SOMETHING I FOUND INTERESTING AND I WANT TO KEEP

03:22 DIGGING INTO.

03:28 HOW MUCH CAN JOE BIDEN KEEP DOING TO JUICE THE ECONOMY

03:29 HEADING INTO THE ELECTION. WHETHER IT'S RELIEVING STUDENT

03:34 LOAN DEBT, PUMPING MORE MONEY INTO INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING.

03:39 HOW MUCH MORE COULD HE DO TO TRY AND GIVE MORE LEEWAY SO

03:43 PEOPLE'S MEMORIES RESET IN LOWER INFLATION AND HIGHER

03:45 GROWTH WORLD. JONATHAN: WE WILL CATCH UP WITH AMH IN

03:48 JUST A MOMENT. RIGHT NOW LET'S GET YOU SET UP

03:50 FOR PAYROLLS. ALMOST UNCHANGED POSITIVE BY

03:55 .1% ON THE S&P. YIELDS COMING IN A LITTLE BIT

04:02 DOWN A BASIS POINT 4.07% ON THE 10-YEAR.

04:05 ANYTHING BUT ON DOLLAR-YEN. YEN STRENGTH AGAIN.

04:13 THE REPORT SAYS FOLLOWING THE REPORTED BLOOMBERG THIS BOJ IS

04:15 GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER THE HIKING RATES THIS MONTH. LISA:

04:21 WE ALWAYS THINK THEY ARE GOING TO HIKE RATES AND GO BACK TO

04:24 ZERO AND THEN IT'S PUSHED BACK BUT THIS TIME SEEMS DIFFERENT.

04:26 WE'VE HEARD THAT RHETORIC OUT OF THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF

04:30 OFFICIALS AND THE MARKET ALL THE PRICING AND WITH DEFINITIVE

04:35 KIND OF CONVICTION THAT IN THE MARCH 18 AND 19TH MEETING THE

04:39 BANK OF JAPAN WILL AFTER A DECADE, MORE THAN A DECADE LIFT

04:43 RATES TO ZERO WITH WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN THE BOND MARKET WITH

04:46 YIELDS OF THE HIGHEST-PAID JONATHAN:

04:49 POSSIBLY MAYBE PERHAPS. WE WILL SEE. NEGATIVE BY .7%.

04:55 COMING UP CAMERON DORSET COUNTING DOWN TO THE LATEST

04:56 PAYROLLS REPORT. PRESIDENT BIDEN FRAMES HIS RACE

05:05 AGAINST DONALD TRUMP AND IRA RODRIGUEZ ON POWELL'S HEATED

05:06 EXCHANGE WITH SENATOR WARREN ON CAPITOL HILL.

05:11 COUNTING DOWN TO PAYROLLS. BLOOMBERG SURVEY EXPECTING 200

05:14 K WITH UNEMPLOYMENT AT 3.7%. SAYING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE

05:18 FED TO START CUTTING MAY BE NARROW.

05:22 THE FED PUTTING CUTS IN MAY AND JUNE WITHOUT BEING TOO CLOSE TO

05:26 THE ELECTION WITH THE PERCEPTION THAT THEY ARE BEING

05:28 POLITICAL. THE DATA MAY NOT SUPPORT CUTS.

05:31 CAMERON JOINS US FOR MORE. WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR THIS

05:35 MORNING.

05:41 >> IF WE SEE UPSIDE SURPRISES TO THE JOB PRINTS IT'S VERY

05:44 LIKELY YOU CAN SEE THESE RATE CUTS PUSHED BACK.

05:49 WE WATCH THINGS LIKE PMI'S AND MANUFACTURING DATA THAT SUGGEST

05:51 THERE IS A CYCLICAL RECOVERY BREWING IN THIS ECONOMY WHICH

05:54 MAY NOT SUPPORT THAT MAY OR JUNE CUT WHICH THEN CLOSE THE

05:59 WINDOW TO BE ABLE TO CUT THIS YEAR OR AT LEAST PUT US IN A

06:01 PLACE WHERE THEY ARE HAVING TO CUT AFTER THE ELECTION.

06:05 >> YOU'RE TALKING WHAT A CYCLICAL RE-ACCELERATION.

06:07 JOHN POWELL SAYING WE ARE VERY RESTRICTIVE.

06:11 THOSE TWO THINGS DON'T REALLY ADD UP DO THEY.

06:15 >> WE ARE SIMPLY NOT SEEING THE WEIGHT OF THESE INTEREST RATE

06:18 HIKES ON THIS ECONOMY BECAUSE THIS IS ECONOMY IS STILL LEFT

06:21 LEVER TO SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES THAN IT HAS AT ANY OTHER

06:23 HIKING CYCLE IN RECENT HISTORY. THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE GREAT

06:28 REFINANCING WE HAD IN 2020, HOWARD TALKED ABOUT THAT

06:32 YESTERDAY. YOU REFINANCE YOUR DEBT, THE

06:35 FED HIKES RATE SPRING YOU ARE NOT SEEING THESE GO UP LIKE YOU

06:36 HAVE IN PRIOR CYCLES.

06:42 THAT'S WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR IN REFINANCING KICKING IN.

06:45 THAT'S WHERE WE COULD SEE SOME ECONOMIC WEAKNESS BECAUSE OF

06:48 STRESS ON BALANCE SHEETS. UNTIL THEN YOU'RE SEEING THE

06:52 CYCLICAL RECOVERY BECAUSE OF FISCAL STIMULUS AS WELL.

06:57 >> I WANT TO DOUBLE DOWN ON THE QUESTION JOHN ASKED WHICH IS

06:58 REALLY COMPELLING. BASICALLY WE ARE REALLY CLOSE

07:05 TO CUTTING RATES DESPITE THE FACT PEOPLE LIKE YOURSELF ARE

07:07 SAYING THERE IS THIS RISK OF RE-INFLATION.

07:11 SO WHAT DO YOU SEE THE LIKELIHOOD OF A RATE CUT

07:13 ACCELERATING THAT REINFLATION OF THE ECONOMY.

07:15 HOW DO YOU LEAD THAT THROUGH A MARKET THAT SEEMS PRETTY

07:21 COMPLACENT ABOUT THIS RISK.

07:23 >> WE KNOW THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FINANCIAL

07:26 CONDITIONS AND NOMINAL GDP GROWTH BUT ITS FINANCIAL

07:27 CONDITIONS THAT ARE SUSTAINED AT EASY LEVELS.

07:30 IF WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE FINANCIAL CONDITION STAY AT THE

07:33 LEVELS WHERE THEY ARE TODAY AT 2021 WOULD SUGGEST IT IS

07:37 SUPPORTIVE OF GROWTH AND SUPPORTIVE OF INFLATION MOVING

07:40 HIGHER. WE ALSO TO WATCH THINGS LIKE

07:43 OIL ON THE MOVE, GASOLINE PRICES UP 11% OVER THE LAST

07:45 MONTH. LET'S NOT FORGET COPPER MOVED A

07:48 LOT YESTERDAY. THIS IS ALL SIGNS THERE'S THIS

07:54 CYCLICAL REACCELERATION BREWING WHICH DOESN'T NECESSARILY SAY

07:58 THE FED NEEDS TO CUT TODAY OR NOW IN ORDER TO GET IN FRONT OF

07:59 SOME WEAKNESS.

08:03 >> WHAT ARE THE RISKS THAT AREN'T BEING PRICED IN.

08:07 WHERE IS THE ASYMMETRY IN THE MARKET.

08:09 IT STRIKES ME THE IDEA OF REINFLATION IS NOT BEING PRICED

08:14 IN. WHERE IS IT MOST NOT PRICED IN?

08:18 >> IF YOU LOOK AT CYCLICALS VERSUS DEFENSES.

08:21 IT SEEMS TO SUGGEST THERE IS SOME REINFLATION GOING ON, SOME

08:25 CYCLICAL REACCELERATION WHICH JUST MEANS YIELDS AT THESE

08:30 LEVELS PROBABLY ARE MISPRICED IF THAT REACCELERATION HAPPEN

08:34 SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU'VE SEEN THIS MOVEMENT LOWER IN THE TWO-YEAR

08:38 AND THE SPREAD STILL SUGGESTS THE FED WILL CUT SOON IF THE

08:42 FED DOES NOT CUT SOON MAYBE THERE IS UP OR PRESSURE ON

08:43 YIELDS. JONATHAN: EIGHT DAYS OF GAINS ON GOLD.

08:50 THE LONGEST DAILY WINNING STREAK GOING BACK TO 2020.

08:53 WHAT IS BEHIND THIS CHART? CAMERON:

08:55 WE'VE BEEN CALLING IT THE CURIOUS CASE OF THE GOLD IN THE

08:59 NIGHT. DOES IT MEAN REAL RATES ARE

09:02 PEEKING OUT? GOLD IS ASSOCIATED WITH A

09:09 WEAKER DOLLAR AND LOWER REAL YIELDS.

09:14 IF INFLATION IS MOVING UP THAT PULLS REAL YIELDS LOWER.

09:20 >> I'M TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT. WE START TO THINK ABOUT

09:25 SHIFTING AWAY FROM THE U.S. DOLLAR TOWARDS SOMETHING ELSE

09:28 AND THEN WE SEE THIS ROLL UP IN GOLD I'M WONDERING IF IT'S MORE

09:29 THAN JUST SAYING THE MACRO BACKDROP. CAMERON:

09:34 YOU'VE SEEN CENTRAL BANKS FAVOR GOLD PURCHASES REALLY SINCE THE

09:36 RUSSIAN INVASION AND THE RESPONSE TO THAT.

09:39 USING CENTRAL BANKS MOVE INTO GOLD.

09:42 YOU HAVEN'T NECESSARILY SEEN INVESTORS.

09:48 THIS IS NOT THE RUSH INTO GOLD LIKE YOU TYPICALLY DO IT PEAKS.

09:51 THIS WOULD SUGGEST INVESTORS ARE THE SOURCE BEHIND IT BUT IT

09:52 CENTRAL BANKS. I WOULDN'T GO SO FAR AS TO SAY

09:58 THIS IS THE ULTIMATE SIGN THE DOLLAR IS LOSING ITS RESERVE

09:59 CURRENCY.

09:59 THE WORRY ABOUT THE LIST -- JONATHAN: YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING.

10:08 [LAUGHTER] LISA: FINISH YOUR THOUGHT.

10:13 CAMERON: SIMPLY THERE'S NOT A BETTER

10:14 OPTION OUT THERE. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEE A

10:21 COMPLETE REMOVAL OF THE DOLLAR AS THE CENTRAL RESERVE CURRENCY

10:23 BECAUSE WHERE ELSE WILL YOU GO. THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN TALK OF A

10:29 BASKET OF CURRENCIES BUT I DO THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY

10:33 FROM NEITHER PARTY ARE WE HEARING ANY TALK OF BUDGET

10:34 RESTRAINT WHICH JUST MEANS WE STILL HAVE TO KEEP IN THE BACK

10:38 OF OUR MIND THERE COULD BE SOME VOLATILITY IN YIELDS WHEN IT

10:39 COMES TO THE FUNDING SIDE OF THINGS. LISA:

10:43 I'M SO GLAD YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT GOLD HAS BEEN

10:44 DOING EITHER.

10:52 I'M VERY GRATEFUL THAT I WAS VALIDATED ON SOME LEVEL.

10:54 WHEN IT COMES TO THIS QUESTION THE BUDGET OVERHEAD, SOME OF

10:55 THE COME ON. THE LIZ TRUSS MOMENT IS PERHAPS

11:01 OVER YOUR SKIS IN TERMS OF AN ANALOGY BUT THERE IS THIS

11:03 FEELING IT HAS TO MATTER AT SOME POINT THAT THIS IS A

11:08 HISTORICALLY UNIQUE MOMENT WHERE THE U.S.

11:11 IS BASICALLY BORROWING ITS WAY TO KEEP ITS ECONOMY BOOMING.

11:14 AT WHAT POINT IS IT COMMON -- BECOME AN ISSUE.

11:17 >> I THINK THAT IT HAS TO COME ALONG WITH STRONGER ECONOMIC

11:22 DATA. IT'S BEEN INTERESTING WE'VE

11:25 SEEN A STEP UP IN COUPON ISSUANCE YEAR-TO-DATE.

11:28 IN YIELDS OF MOVE LOWER. YIELDS WE THINK ARE MOVING

11:33 LOWER BECAUSE ECONOMIC SURPRISES ARE MOVING LOWER

11:36 MEANING ECONOMIC DATA ISN'T COMING IN AS HOT AS EXPECTED.

11:40 THERE'S A VERY STRONG RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE 10

11:41 YEAR ECONOMIC SURPRISES. IT SEEMS TO BE MORE IMPORTANT

11:45 THAN WHAT THE TREASURY IS DOING WITH ITS REFUNDING. JONATHAN:

11:51 WE JUST HAVEN'T HAD THOSE UPSIDE SURPRISES GOING INTO

11:55 PAYROLL. LISA:

11:56 IT'S BEEN TRENDING SIGNIFICANTLY THROUGH THE

11:59 LOWEST LEVELS. TO YOUR POINT SORT OF RAISING

12:02 THIS QUESTION OF PEOPLE TAKING THAT TOLL RISK OF REINFLATION

12:04 OFF THE TABLE.

12:09 >> WE ARE LOOKING FOR 200 K TODAY IN PAYROLLS.

12:13 4.0 7% ON A TWO YEAR YIELD. CAMERON DAWSON'S GET A STICK

12:17 WITH US. LET'S GET YOU UP TO SPEED AND

12:20 UP TO DATE WITH STORIES ELSEWHERE.

12:21 HERE'S YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF.

12:27 >> POSED TO SECURE ENOUGH SUPPORT FOR A SECOND FIVE-YEAR

12:28 TERM AS THE IMF MANAGING DIRECTOR.

12:35 TO ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF ANY POTENTIAL BID.

12:38 SOURCES SAY THEIR PURSUIT OF A SECOND TERM WOULD COME WITH THE

12:41 UNDERSTANDING THAT SHE IS THE SUPPORT OF FRANCE AND GERMANY.

12:45 BOEING'S LINKING WORKER BONUSES TO SAFETY FOLLOWING THE ALASKA

12:49 BLOWOUT EARLIER THIS YEAR. EMPLOYEES WILL NOW SEE 60% OF

12:53 THEIR ANNUAL INCENTIVE SCORE BASED ON SAFETY AND QUALITY

12:58 METRICS.

13:00 PREVIOUSLY 75% OF THE SCORE WAS BASED ON FINANCIAL METRICS.

13:02 IT'S THE LATEST OF THEIR MOVES TO ADDRESS QUALITY ISSUES OF

13:07 THE COMPANY.

13:08 THE BATTLE TO BAN TIKTOK HEATS UP YET AGAIN.

13:09 STEVE SCULLY SAID HE WOULD BRING A BILL TO THE FLOOR NEXT

13:14 WEEK WOULD FORCE TIKTOK TO SEVER TIES WITH THE CHINESE

13:15 COMMUNIST PARTY. HE POSTED ON X AND CALLED IT

13:19 CRITICAL FOR NATIONAL SECURITY. TIKTOK SAID THE PUSH

13:25 NOTIFICATIONS OF SOME OF ITS USERS ENCOURAGING THEM TO CALL

13:26 THEIR REPRESENTATIVES AND ASK THEM TO VOTE AGAINST THE BILL.

13:32 IT -- URGED USERS TO SPEAK UP NOW.

13:34 THAT'S YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF.

13:39 >> THE BUSINESS OF INTERFERING IN POLITICS WITHIN THE

13:41 INTERFERING POLITICS BY SENDING YOU PUSH NOTIFICATIONS.

13:45 >> IT SORT OF PICK YOUR POISON. JONATHAN:

13:49 WE WILL AVOID THAT ONE TODAY. UP NEXT ON THE PROGRAM

13:55 PRESIDENT BIDEN SETTING THE STAGE FOR NOVEMBER.

14:00 >> TAUGHT ME TO EMBRACE FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY.

14:04 A FUTURE BASED ON CORE VALUES AND A DEFINED AMERICA.

14:05 HONESTY, DECENCY, DIGNITY. I BELIEVE IN AMERICA.

14:09 I BELIEVE IN YOU THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

14:13 >> THAT CONVERSATION NEXT DOWN IN WASHINGTON DC LIVE FROM NEW

14:19 YORK CITY, GOOD MORNING.

14:22 ♪

15:11 JONATHAN: EQUITIES ON THE S&P 500

15:13 SLIGHTLY POSITIVE. YIELDS A LITTLE BIT LOWER.

15:15 DOWN A BASIS POINT ON THE 10 YEAR.

15:20 UNDER SURVEILLANCE THIS MORNING PRESIDENT BIDEN SETTING THE

15:21 STAGE FOR NOVEMBER.

15:24 >> I'VE BEEN AROUND A WHILE. MY LIFETIME IS TOLD ME TO

15:28 EMBRACE FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY. IF FUTURE BASED ON CORE VALUES

15:32 AND A DEFINED AMERICA. HONESTY, DECENCY, DIGNITY,

15:36 QUALITY. WHAT MAKES THIS RARE IS THE

15:41 FREEDOM OF DEMOCRACY UNDER ATTACK AT HOME AND OVERSEAS.

15:45 IF ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM THINKS PUTIN WILL STOP AT UKRAINE I

15:47 ASSURE YOU HE WILL NOT. MY PREDECESSOR AND SOME OF YOU

15:53 HERE SEEM TO BURY THE TRUTH ABOUT JANUARY 6.

15:56 YOU CANNOT LOVE YOUR COUNTRY ONLY WHEN YOU WIN.

15:59 I BELIEVE IN AMERICA. I BELIEVE IN THE AMERICAN

16:01 PEOPLE. JONATHAN: DO YOU THINK THAT JOKE LANDED

16:04 AT THE START THERE? LISA: I THINK IT LANDED WITH A COUPLE

16:09 OF PEOPLE BUT NOT THAT MANY. JONATHAN:

16:13 HERE'S THE LATEST THIS MORNING. THE PRESIDENT OUTLINING HIS

16:16 LAND -- MOVE FORWARD AS A REMATCH AGAINST ALL TRUMP IS

16:17 ALL BUT CERTAIN. LOOKING AT KEY ISSUES.

16:23 BIDEN CONTINUING TO TRAIL THE FORMER PRESIDENT IN SEVERAL

16:25 SWING STATES. ANNE-MARIE JOINS US NOW FOR

16:26 MORE. HOW HAS THIS ONE GONE DOWN IN

16:30 THE AFTERMATH OF THE SPEECH DELIVERED? ANNMARIE:

16:37 LET'S LOOK TO TERRY HAINES THIS MORNING, THE BAR WAS SO LOW.

16:40 IF YOU LOOK AT WITH THE POLLING WAS HEADING INTO THIS SPEECH,

16:44 THE ECONOMIST SAID ONLY 16% OF AMERICANS POLLED HAD SOMETHING

16:48 BIG TO EXPECT FROM PRESIDENT BIDEN.

16:50 WITH THE BAR THAT LOW HE WAS ABLE TO PRETTY MUCH OVERCOME IT.

16:56 HE IMMEDIATELY WENT AFTER THE PREDECESSOR AS HE'S CALLING HIM

17:01 NEVER WANTING TO NAME HIM BY NAME BUT CLEARLY THIS WAS A

17:07 POLITICAL SPEECH. FOR MORE INSIGHT I WANT TO

17:11 BRING IN -- EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT THIS WAS ABOUT HOW HE

17:14 CAME OUT AND NOT SO MUCH THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT HE SAID.

17:19 >> THE PRESIDENT HAD TO SET THIS OUT.

17:22 REELECTIONS ARE ABOUT A REFERENDUM ON THE CURRENT

17:25 INCOME AND OR DOES HE MAKE THIS A CHOICE ALEXION.

17:28 BIDEN'S NUMBERS ARE DOWN. IT IS A REFERENDUM AND HE NEEDS

17:36 TO CHANGE THAT TRAJECTORY, MAKING IT A COMPARISON BETWEEN

17:42 HIM AND TRUMP.

17:44 HE REALLY TRIED TO LAY OUT BETWEEN HIM AND TRUMP.

17:45 IT MADE THE BASE VERY HAPPY. WE HAVE TO SEE IF THAT MAKES A

17:50 DIFFERENCE FOR THE KEY VOTERS WILL DECIDE THE SELECTION.

17:56 >> WHETHER IT WAS NATO, ABORTION, JANUARY 6 HE WANTED

17:58 TO SHOW THAT BIG GAP BETWEEN HIM AND FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP.

18:02 TO THESE ISSUES DO VOTERS ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT. JEANNETTE:

18:06 DIFFERENT POCKETS WILL CARE MORE ABOUT DIFFERENT THINGS.

18:10 TO SOME EXTENT HE MIGHT BE LOOKING TO THIS NIKKI HALEY

18:13 VOTERS TALKING ABOUT NATO AND RUSSIA AND UKRAINE.

18:18 HE'S GOING TO MAKE A BIG FOCUS ABOUT WOMEN VOTERS AND TALKING

18:20 ABOUT ABORTION RIGHTS AND REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AND HE ALSO

18:24 WANTS TO REMIND PEOPLE OF WHAT HAPPENED UNDER TRUMP.

18:26 WHAT HAPPENED WITH JANUARY 6 AND PLAY THAT UP AS WELL.

18:32 >> PRESIDENT BIDEN EARLY ON IN HIS ADMINISTRATION HAD

18:34 DEMOCRATIC CONTROL OF THE HOUSE AND SENATE AND HE'S TALKING

18:36 ABOUT TAX POLICY HE COULD NOT GET THROUGH THEM.

18:39 AS ANY OF THIS HAVE A FUTURE OR IS IT ALL POLITICAL TALKING TO

18:44 THE BASE.

18:45 >> HERE'S THE ONE THING I THINK IS IMPORTANT A LOT OF THIS WAS

18:48 TALKING TO THE BASE. IF YOU TOOK IT JUST AS HE WOULD

18:51 HAVE COMPLETE POWER THIS A LOT OF SPENDING IN THERE, TAX

18:53 INCREASES TO PAY FOR MIDDLE-CLASS TAX CUTS.

18:57 THE BIG THING WE WILL BE WATCHING FOR IS AT THE END OF

19:00 2025 WITH THIS FISCAL CLIFF WITH A TRUMP TAX CUTS EXPIRE.

19:05 WE ARE CURRENTLY IN A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE A HIGHER DEFICIT,

19:08 HIGHER INTEREST RATE COSTS AND TO NO LONGER CONGRESS CAN SAY

19:12 WE DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR SOMETHING SO IF WE ARE GOING TO

19:14 EXTEND THIS TAX CUT WHICH BOTH THE DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS

19:20 WANT TO DO THEY HAVE TO START THINKING ABOUT WHETHER THERE

19:22 COULD BE OTHER TAX CHANGES IN PLAY PRAYED WE HAVE THE HOUSE

19:27 BUDGET CHAIRMAN SAYING HE NOW SEES TAX CHANGES MIGHT HAVE TO

19:29 BE ON THE TABLE BECAUSE OF THESE CONCERNS. ANNMARIE:

19:32 WHAT KIND OF CHANGES COULD WE SEE. HE'S TALKING ABOUT CUTTING

19:35 TAXES EVEN MORE.

19:39 >> HOW THEY WILL PAY FOR THAT WILL BE DIFFICULT.

19:42 ONE OF THE THINGS HE'S TRYING TO SAY IS HE COULD USE HIS

19:44 TRADE POLICY TO PAY FOR IT SINCE HE WANTS TO IMPLEMENT A

19:47 TAX ON ALL IMPORTS COMING INTO THE U.S..

19:50 THAT'S GOOD TO BE TRICKY BECAUSE WHEN THE REALITY COMES

19:54 NEXT YEAR WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN PAY FOR

19:57 ANY OF THESE THINGS OR ARE THEY KNOCKING TO GO THROUGH.

20:03 >> AMERICANS ARE CLEARLY STRUGGLING IT FELT LIKE HE WAS

20:06 SPEAKING DIRECTLY TO ELIZABETH WARREN WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT

20:08 THIS. COULD YOU SEE THAT HAPPENING

20:09 AND HOW THEY PAY FOR THAT. HELPING AMERICANS GET ON THE

20:13 PROPERTY LINE. JEANNETTE: HE'S DEFINITELY TALKING TO THE

20:19 AFFORDABILITY ISSUE WHICH IS ONE OF HIS WEAKNESSES IN THE

20:23 ELECTION CYCLE AND THAT'S CAN IT BE AN EXPENSIVE PROGRAM TO

20:27 PUT INTO PLACE SO I DON'T SEE IT LIKELY TO HAPPEN BUT IT IS

20:31 SOMETHING HE IS TRYING TO TALK ABOUT HE COULD TRY TO BRING

20:34 DOWN COSTS FOR AMERICANS WHEN THERE STILL DISINFLATION

20:37 PROBLEM BURIED ANNMARIE: -- INFLATION PROBLEM. ANNMARIE:

20:42 SOME OF THEM COMING BACK AFTER THE COVID PANDEMIC.

20:47 WE WILL GET A JOBS REPORT TODAY WHERE PEOPLE ARE EXPECTING

20:51 AROUND 200,000 AT LEAST. WHAT IS THIS NOT RESONATING WITH THE

20:55 AMERICAN PEOPLE? JEANNETTE: THE PRICE LEVEL OF GOODS WE SEE

20:59 IS THE BIGGER ISSUE. THAT STICKS.

21:03 EVEN IF WE HAVE INFLATION COMING DOWN.

21:06 SO VOTERS STILL SEE THAT, THEY SEE THAT EVERY DAY AND EVERY

21:12 WEEK. THAT'S WHERE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS ARE.

21:16 YOU DO HAVE THE ISSUE WHERE IF YOU ARE PAYING A NEW MORTGAGE

21:20 YOU ARE LOOKING AT A 7% RATE VERSUS A 3% RATE A COUPLE YEARS

21:22 AGO. THOSE OF THE BREAD-AND-BUTTER

21:26 ISSUES THAT GOES TO WHAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY FEEL AND THAT MAKES IT

21:29 MORE DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO KNOW THE ECONOMY IS DOING WELL

21:32 BUT I AM PAYING MORE OR FEEL LIKE I'M PAYING MORE AND THAT'S

21:35 THE DIFFICULT HURDLE FOR HIM TO GET OVER. ANNMARIE:

21:38 THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS MORNING.

21:46 PRESIDENT BIDEN TRYING TO TALK TO AMERICANS ABOUT ISSUES THAT

21:48 STILL MATTER TO HIM WHEN IT COMES TO INFLATION.

21:54 MAYBE THIS IDEA OF THE MORTGAGES, GETTING ON THE

21:56 LATTER COULD HELP. I'M NOT SURE IF SHRINK FELICIA

22:00 AND LANDED THE WAY -- SHRINKFLATION LANDED WHERE HE

22:03 WANTED TO. JONATHAN: PEOPLE CAN GET ON THE HOUSING

22:07 LATTER WHAT IS THE SOLUTION. WE ARE THINKING BUILD MORE

22:10 HOMES, MORE HOUSES. WHAT POLITICIANS ALWAYS DO,

22:13 DEMAND SIDE. GIVE THEM MORE MONEY,

22:16 EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM. LISA:

22:23 THERE IS THIS QUESTION OF HOW LONG THEY CAN DO THIS TO SAY I

22:25 WILL HAND YOU A FEW BUCKS. THERE'S A QUESTION OF HOW LONG

22:31 YOU CAN DO THAT BEFORE IT BECOMES COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AND

22:32 THAT WILL BE A CONVERSATION FOR ANOTHER DAY. JONATHAN:

22:36 WE CAN DO IT AGAIN. 15 MILLION NEW JOBS IN JUST

22:39 THREE YEARS WE CAN HAVE AN ARGUMENT ABOUT THOSE JOBS

22:41 RESTORED FROM THE PANDEMIC. 800 THOUSAND MANUFACTURING JOBS

22:46 IN AMERICA AND COUNTING. UNEMPLOYMENT SAT AT 4%.

22:53 IT'S AMAZING TO SEE THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS GONE FROM ZERO TO

22:57 5.5. HOW DO YOU THINK WE ACHIEVED

22:58 THAT IN THIS ECONOMY. IF I TOLD THIS TO YOU MAYBE A

23:03 YEAR AGO SAYING UNEMPLOYED WILL BE MUCH HIGHER THAN 4%. 3.7%.

23:08 HOW DO WE DO THIS? LISA:

23:15 WHERE'S THE PAIN -- CAMERON: PART OF IT IS BECAUSE OF THE

23:17 FISCAL SPENDING AND THE SUPPORT FROM THE FISCAL SIDE OF THINGS.

23:22 YOU TIGHTEN MONETARY POLICY BUT LOOSEN FISCAL POLICY KEEPS

23:26 THINGS RESILIENT BUT IT COMES BACK TO THE SENSITIVITY OF

23:29 SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES IN THIS ECONOMY.

23:31 WE CAN CONTRAST WHAT HAPPENED IN EUROPE WHERE THERE'S A LOT

23:35 MORE SENSITIVITY TO SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES AND YET GROWTH

23:41 HAS BEEN MUCH WEAKER AND THAT'S THE KEY REASON WHY THIS ECONOMY

23:42 HAS HELD UP SO WELL. JONATHAN: ECB VERSUS FED, ECB?

23:49 CAMERON: THE DATA ALREADY SUPPORTS IT.

23:52 JONATHAN: ABOUT APRIL NOW, DID YOU HEAR

23:53 THAT WHISPER? LISA: TO YOUR POINT WHY DIDN'T THEY

23:58 CUT YESTERDAY IF THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE THAT BIG.

24:02 MY QUESTION IS WHY WE NOT SEEING MORE DOLLARS STRENGTH.

24:05 YOU'VE GOT EUROPE SAYING WE WILL CUT FIRST, WE WILL CUT

24:07 AGGRESSIVELY. THE FED -- IT'S AN INTERESTING

24:12 CROSS.

24:18 >> THE DOLLAR INDEX NEGATIVE BY .1%. GOOD TO SEE YOU.

24:21 CAMERON DAWSON OF NEW AGE WEALTH. WELLS FARGO EXPECTING

24:26 UNEMPLOYMENT TO HOLD STEADY AT 3.7% AFTER A VERY HOT PAYROLLS

24:30 REPORT BACK IN JANUARY. THAT CONVERSATION UP NEXT.

24:46 JONATHAN: ALL-TIME HIGHS GOING INTO

24:48 PAYROLLS. ADDING WEIGHT TO THE RALLY ON

24:51 THE S&P 500. EQUITIES LOOKING AT THE NASDAQ

24:54 A LITTLE BIT NEGATIVE SOFTER. DOWN BY 0.06%.

24:58 WE ARE HEADED TOWARDS A THIRD CONSECUTIVE WEEK OF GAINS ON

25:03 THE S&P 500. GETTING TO THE BOND MARKET TO

25:08 YEAR YIELD AND DOWN A SINGLE BASIS POINT.

25:14 A COUPLE MONDAYS AGO, WE BACKED AWAY THE DATA HAS NOT BLOWN OUR

25:16 EXPECTATIONS THE SAME WAY AS IT DID A MONTH AGO. JONATHAN:

25:23 THIS BID -- LISA: THIS BID INTO BONDS WE'VE SEEN.

25:27 GLOBAL BONDS OF THE STRONGEST INFLOWS IN THE PAST WEEK SINCE

25:30 JANUARY OF 2023 FOCUSING ON DEVELOPED MARKETS IN PARTICULAR

25:33 THE UNITED STATES PEOPLE FLOODING IN WITH THE IDEA OF

25:37 RATE CUTS, ECONOMIC DATA DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A RISK.

25:41 >> THE ECB SEEMED TO UNLOCK SOME OF THAT ENTHUSIASM EASTERN

25:45 TIME. JUST FORECASTING INFLATION A

25:47 LITTLE BIT SOFTER THAN EXPECTED IN THE PREVIOUS ROUND OF

25:52 FORECASTS. HITTING 2% BY NEXT YEAR WHICH

25:55 BEGS THE QUESTION WHY GO SOMETIME SOON OR THE ECB. LISA:

25:58 WHAT IS THE ARGUMENT AGAINST THAT.

26:03 YOU ALSO HAVE 100 BASIS POINTS A FULL PERCENTAGE POINT OF A

26:04 CUT AT THE ECB. IT RAISES SOME REAL QUESTIONS

26:07 PRAYED IF THE U.S. ECONOMY IS SO STRONG WOULDN'T

26:12 YOU EXPECT THIS DIVERGENCE TO PLAY INTO THE CURRENCY CROSS.

26:18 IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT WOULDN'T YOU SORT OF EXPECT INCREDIBLE

26:22 DOLLARS STRENGTH IF THE FED WERE GOING TO CUT LESS THEN THE

26:25 ECB IF THE FED HAD THAT INCREDIBLE STRENGTH THEY ARE

26:31 FACING OFF CUTTING OUTLOOK GROWTHS?

26:32 WHY WOULDN'T THIS BE AN OBVIOUS CATALYST. JONATHAN:

26:38 WE ARE BACK TO 1.09 ON THE EURO. A BIT SOFTER THIS MORNING.

26:41 WHAT A MOVE THIS WEEK. JAPANESE YEN, DOLLAR-YEN, AMID

26:46 STRENGTH. BIG TIME IN THE LAST COUPLE OF

26:50 DAYS DOWN ANOTHER .7%. JAPANESE YEN STRENGTH IN THE

26:54 FACE OF SEVERAL BOARDS. YESTERDAY WE HAD TWO REPORTS

27:00 PRAYED ONE OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WHO SEEM TO BE OK

27:02 WITH THE NEAR-TERM HIKE FOR THE BOJ.

27:05 ANOTHER, BOJ OFFICIALS WHO SEEM TO BE GAINING CONFIDENCE IN THE

27:07 WAGE DATA. COULD BE CRITICAL BASED ON THE

27:14 REPORT THIS MORNING SUGGESTING MAYBE WE COULD BE GOOD TO GO

27:15 FOR LIFT LATER THIS MONTH. LISA: WAGE NEGOTIATIONS I'VE ALREADY

27:21 HAD THE BIGGEST WAGE GAINS GOING BACK DECADES.

27:24 WE ARE SEEING BOND YIELDS AT

27:30 THE HIGHEST GOING BACK TO 2011, WHAT I AM LOOKING AT IS A

27:36 MARKET ALLOWING THE BANK OF JAPAN TO NORMALIZE WITHOUT

27:40 ENORMOUS DISRUPTION. SAYING IF THEY WERE TO MOVE IT

27:43 WOULD CAUSE THE UNREST TO THE SURGE IN YIELDS.

27:45 THAT IS TELLING. JONATHAN: MARCH IS NOT OCTOBER.

27:56 LOOKING INTO OCTOBER, THE 10-YEAR BACK ALL LOOKING AT A

27:59 LONG LIST OF REASONS FOR WHY BONDS COULD SELLOFF MORE IN

28:01 YIELDS COULD GO HIGHER. DIFFERENT STORY.

28:07 IT LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE GETTING A FREE PASS TO DO SOMETHING FOR

28:08 A LONG TIME. LISA: PEOPLE ARE SAYING THEY WILL.

28:14 JONATHAN: UNDER SURVEILLANCE THIS

28:17 MORNING, YOUR TOP STORY. PRESIDENT BIDEN SETTING THE

28:23 AGENDA IN LAST NIGHT STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS.

28:27 BIDEN LOOKED TO DRAW A LINE BETWEEN HIM AND TRUMP AS A SLEW

28:31 OF POLLS SHOW THE FORMER PRESIDENT IN -- KEY

28:32 BATTLEGROUND STATES.

28:38 AND RE-PRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. FOR SOCIAL MEDIA TO RESPOND.

28:49 ONE HOUR, SOMETHING LIKE THAT, PLENTY OF ENERGY, LITTLE BIT OF

28:50 ANGER AT TIMES. WANTING TO TALK ABOUT THE

28:54 POLICY, OF THE SUBSTANCE. LISA: THE ONE THING I TOOK AWAY FROM

28:59 IT WAS NOT THE LEAD. I APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE OF

29:04 PEOPLE WERE LOOKING FOR REVIEW OF HIS CADENCE OR SOME OF THE

29:07 TROLLING BY TRUMP AFTERWARDS. WHAT I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT WAS

29:15 CHINA AND HOW HE COMPARED IT TO TRUMP'S POLICY AND INDICATED HE

29:19 WAS HARDER ON CHINA THAN HIS PRESIDENTS OR -- PREDECESSOR

29:25 PRAYED SAYING ADVANCED AMERICAN TECHNOLOGIES CANNOT BE USED IN

29:29 CHINESE. I WAS TRYING TO EXTRAPOLATE

29:34 THAT OUT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN.

29:38 ESSENTIALLY IT SEEMS TO BE, -- IN A MATURE WAY.

29:43 IT SEEMS BIDEN IS DOUBLING DOWN ON THAT.

29:50 >> I WANT COMPETITION WITH CHINA NOT CONFLICT. LISA:

29:54 IT SEEMS TO BE EXACTLY IN OPPOSITION TO WHAT HE WAS

29:59 SAYING EARLIER WHICH IS BANNING CERTAIN AMERICAN TECHNOLOGIES

30:02 FROM CHINA ESPECIALLY AT A TIME WHEN YOU HAVE ACTUAL POLICY IN

30:07 CHINA TO REMOVE ALL AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY FROM A CHINESE

30:11 GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS BY SOMETHING LIKE 2037 AND THIS IS

30:12 SOMETHING THEY TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION.

30:15 IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE JUST HEALTHY COMPETITION. JONATHAN:

30:18 THAT WORD CONFLICT IS LOADED. THE WORD ITSELF, YOU ARE

30:25 CONFLICT WITH CHINA IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO BAN AMERICANS FROM

30:29 SELLING VEHICLES AND THEIR COUNTRY BECAUSE YOU BELIEVE

30:31 THERE ARE NATIONAL SECURITY RISKS.

30:32 >> I WOULD REFRAME IT TO BUILD IT TO SAY IF THIS IS WHAT HE

30:38 CONSIDERS COMPETITION EXPECT A HEATED COMPETITION OVER THE

30:40 NEXT FEW YEARS THAT WILL LEAD TO SOME REAL POLICY SHIFTS AS

30:42 WELL.

30:45 >> LET'S GET TO THE CENTRAL WRAP UP.

30:50 THIS IS THIS CENTRAL BANK WRAP UP 24 HOURS.

30:52 FED CHAIR JAY POWELL GIVING TWO DAYS OF TESTIMONY PAL REPEATING

30:54 CUTS ARE COMING. AND CONFIDENT INFLATION IS

30:58 HEADING TOWARDS 2%. THE ECB HOLDING RATE STEADY AT

31:04 ITS MEETING BUT KEEPING THE DOOR WIDE OPEN TO A CUT IN

31:05 APRIL. SOME INVESTORS THE ECB AND FED

31:08 COULD BE ON DIFFERENT TIMELINES. THE BOJ LOOKING AT A DIFFERENT

31:12 POLICY. NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES LATER

31:14 THIS MONTH. A GROWING NUMBER OF BANK

31:20 OFFICIALS LEANING TOWARDS A HIKE WHICH IS WHY WE'VE SEEN A

31:24 LITTLE BIT OF STRENGTH INTRADAY SO FAR THIS MORNING.

31:28 TWO HOURS AWAY FROM THE LATEST PAYROLL SUPPORT.

31:32 JANUARY SCINTILLATING REPORT SHOWS THE LABOR MARKET IS

31:37 HOLDING UP REMARKABLY WELL DESPITE TIGHTER MONETARY POLICY.

31:41 WE LOOK FOR THE RATE TO BE REMAIN UNCHANGED PRAYED FOR

31:45 AVERAGE HOURLY EARNINGS TO EASE TO 0.2 DURING THE MONTH

31:48 NORMALIZING SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR WORKERS.

31:50 SARAH JOINS US FOR MORE.

31:56 WHY WON'T THIS DATA BE A REPEAT OF WHAT WE GOT A MONTH AGO?

31:59 SARAH: WHAT WE SAW COMING OUT OF JANUARY IS IT IS A REAL TOUGH

32:03 MONTH FOR SEASONAL ADJUSTMENT. WE TEND TO FEEL A LOT OF

32:09 LAYOFFS AND JUST THE FACT WE SEE BUSINESSES HOLD ONTO

32:12 WORKERS MORE I THINK THAT WAS A SUPPORT FACTOR.

32:15 WE SAW THAT AND THE WEATHER MAY BE HELPED IN DECEMBER PRAYED WE

32:20 STEP BACK AND WE LOOK AT THE HOLISTIC VIEW OF THE LABOR

32:23 MARKET PRAYED WE SEE A LOT OF SIGNS OF MODERATION.

32:27 FROM HIRING PLANS, LAYOFF ANNOUNCEMENTS RISING AGAIN AS

32:33 WELL AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THE UNDERLYING TREND AS WELCOME AS

32:35 THESE GAMES ARE OVER THE PAST TWO MONTHS HAVE BEEN WE THINK

32:38 THAT TREND IS PROBABLY CLOSER TO 200 RIGHT NOW AND PROBABLY

32:43 SLOWING DOWN CLOSER TO 100 IN THE BACK HALF OF THIS YEAR.

32:48 >> WHAT WE NEED TO SEE WHEN IT COMES TO WAGE GROWTH TO DO THE

32:50 LAST MILE OF THIS? SARAH:

32:57 WE NEED TO SEE WAGE GROWTH CLOSER TO 3.5% ON TREND.

33:02 AND THAT ACCOUNTS FOR THAT 2% INFLATION NUMBER BUT ALSO THAT

33:04 ROUGHLY 1.5% TREND IN PRODUCTIVITY.

33:08 WE ARE GETTING THAT IN TERMS OF THE EMPLOYMENT COST INDEX WHICH

33:11 IS THE FED'S PREFERRED MEASURE OF WAGE COMPENSATION COST BUT

33:15 WE DIDN'T SEE THAT LAST MONTH COMING OUT OF THE AVERAGE

33:17 HOURLY EARNINGS NUMBERS BUT THESE ARE MUCH MORE VOLATILE,

33:21 THEY ARE PRONE TO REVISIONS SO IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE

33:26 IF WE GET THAT COOLING WE EXPECT AND HOW MUCH THAT

33:29 MODERATES THE RECENT TREND AND IF WE ARE AT LEAST GETTING

33:34 CLOSER TO THAT ROUGHLY 3.5% RATE OF NOMINAL WAGE AND LABOR

33:36 COMPENSATION BY COST THE FED WILL BE COMFORTABLE WITH. LISA:

33:41 IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A GREATER NUMBER OF ECONOMISTS THAT SEEM

33:46 COMFORTABLE WITH THIS IDEA OF THE DISINFLATION IS NOT

33:47 THREATENED BY SOME OF THE HIGHER-THAN-EXPECTED PRINCE.

33:50 WE ARE SEEING THIS GRADUAL COOLING IN THE LABOR MARKET

33:53 TALKING ABOUT THE QUITS RATE THAT WE GOT.

33:56 HAS THERE BEEN ANYTHING TO COUNTER THAT THESIS IN YOUR

34:00 VIEW. ANYTHING THAT MAKES YOU MORE

34:03 CONCERNED OF THE MARKET CONSENSUS WHICH IS NOT REALLY A

34:08 RISK. SARAH:

34:09 ONE OF THE CONCERNS AS WE MOVE THROUGH THIS YEAR IS WHAT

34:12 HAPPENS WITH LABOR SUPPLY SO THAT HAS BEEN HUGELY IMPORTANT

34:17 IN TERMS OF BRINGING DOWN COMPENSATION COSTS SO YOU HAD A

34:20 LOT OF SUPPLY IMPROVEMENTS ON THE GOODS ASIDE, THE SUPPLY

34:21 CHAINS NORMALIZING. WE THINK THAT WILL PROBABLY

34:25 LEAD TO LESS DEFLATION IN THE GOODS SECTOR WHICH WILL MAKE IT

34:27 TOUGHER TO SEE THAT OVERALL RATE OF INFLATION DECLINE AT

34:32 THE RATE WE'VE SEEN OVER THE PAST YEAR BUT THE BIG QUESTION

34:35 IN MY MIND IS CAN WE CONTINUE TO SEE THAT COOLING IN LABOR

34:41 COSTS BACK TO THAT RANGE THAT THE FED IS LOOKING FOR IF WE

34:45 DON'T HAVE NEARLY AS STRONG LABOR SUPPLY GROWTH AS WE SAW

34:46 OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS. WE SAW SOME HINTS OF THAT

34:52 GROWTH COOLING IN THE BACK HALF, REALLY THE PAST FEW

34:55 MONTHS OF LAST YEAR AND THEN IN THE JANUARY NUMBERS AS WELL.

34:59 THAT'S ONE KEY ELEMENT IN TERMS OF CAN WE SEE THAT LAST PUSH OF

35:03 GETTING INFLATION BACK TO 2% ON A SUSTAINED BASIS? JONATHAN:

35:09 HE SAID IT CAN AVERAGE HOURLY EARNINGS.

35:13 IGNORE IT AND FOCUS ON HOURS WORKED PRAYED IS IT A CLEAN

35:16 INDICATOR TO LOOK AT AVERAGE HOURLY EARNINGS?

35:19 HOW MUCH INFORMATION DOES THAT HAVE? SARAH:

35:27 WE MUCH PREFER THE ECI DUE TO THE VOLATILITY AND THE FACT

35:30 IT'S NOT COMPOSITION ADJUSTED AND SO IT'S NOT MY FAVORITE

35:32 MEASURE OF WAGES BY ANY MEANS. I THINK THE AVERAGE WEEKLY

35:38 HOURS HAS BEEN INTERESTING SO EVEN IF YOU IGNORE THE BIG DROP

35:42 WE SAW LAST MONTH YOU ARE ALREADY SEEING THE WORKWEEK

35:45 BACK TO WHERE IT WAS BEFORE COVID SUGGESTING WHILE WE ARE

35:48 ADDING A LOT OF JOBS BUSINESSES ARE USING THOSE WORKERS LESS

35:52 INTENSELY. YOU ALSO SEE PART-TIME WORKER

35:55 GROWTH SURPASS FULL-TIME BY A WIDE MARGIN IN TERMS OF THAT

35:59 GROWTH RATE SO THERE SOME SIGNS THAT SHOW WE ARE ADDING A LOT

36:03 OF JOBS BUT THE DEMAND FOR WORKERS IS SLIPPING OR AT LEAST

36:04 THE DEMAND FOR THAT OVERALL LABOR.

36:07 THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT TO WATCH AS WELL.

36:09 >> COMPOSITION. THE COMPOSITION OF PAYROLLS

36:13 GROWTH. AROUND THIS TABLE FOR A LONG

36:19 TIME PEOPLE WERE JOINING US TALKING ABOUT HOW THE BREADTH

36:20 OF PAYROLLS GROWTH WASN'T GOOD. JUST A COUPLE OF INDUSTRIES

36:25 DOING THE HEAVY LIFTING PRAYED ALL OF A SUDDEN NOTE SAY THE

36:32 OPPOSITE. WHAT CHANGED? SARAH: JANUARY CHANGED.

36:35 SO THE BIG PAYROLL GAIN NUMBER AND A BIG INCREASE IN TERMS OF

36:37 THE SHARE OF INDUSTRIES ADDING EMPLOYMENT.

36:41 VERY IMPORTANT THIS REPORT AS WE MOVE THROUGH PERHAPS SOME OF

36:43 THOSE SEASONAL FACTORS AS WELL. EVEN AS WE HAVE SEEN THAT BRETT

36:50 FOR WIDEN OUT A LITTLE BIT YOU ARE STILL SEEING A VERY LARGE

36:53 PROPORTION OF JOBS BEING ADDED IN GOVERNMENT AND HEALTH CARE

36:58 SO TWO OF THE LESS CYCLICALLY SENSITIVE INDUSTRIES THAT'S

37:02 GREAT IN TERMS OF ITS OFFERING THE BALLAST AS WE SEE THE

37:03 OVERALL RESTRICTIVE STANCE OR AT LEAST NOT IN ACCOMMODATIVE

37:09 STANCE OF MONETARY POLICY WEIGHING ON SOME OF THOSE

37:11 CYCLICAL INDUSTRIES BUT I THINK AS WE MOVE THROUGH THIS YEAR WE

37:17 SEE THOSE SEASONAL AFFECTIVE JANUARY BECAME -- WE ARE PAYING

37:18 CLOSE ATTENTION TO ARE WE SEEING THAT HOLD UP OR DO WE

37:21 SEE A CONTINUATION OF THE DOWNWARD TREND WE SAW OVER 2023.

37:26 JONATHAN: THE CONVERSATION FLIPPED VERY

37:30 QUICKLY. GOOD TO CATCH UP. 200 K THE ESTIMATE IN OUR

37:36 SURVEY THE PREVIOUS NUMBER 353.

37:38 >> SO MANY DETAILS UNDER THE HOOD.

37:41 JUST HOW THE HOURS OR WORK I THINK WILL BE INTERESTING.

37:46 I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THE IDEA OF PRODUCTIVITY THAT'S BEEN ONE OF

37:47 THESE CONCEPTS BEHIND THIS INCREDIBLE RALLY.

37:51 CAN THAT CONTINUE AND IN ALL THESE DATA POINTS I THINK THEY

37:54 WILL BE TRY TO PUT TOGETHER THAT STORY OF WHETHER IT HAS

37:57 LEGS.

37:58 >> THAT NUMBER IS A FEW HOURS AWAY.

38:01 LET'S GET AN UPDATE ON STORIES ELSEWHERE.

38:04 HERE'S YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF WITH DANI BURGER.

38:09 >> NEW YORK'S PRIVATE SECTOR WORKFORCE HIT A RECORD FOR THE

38:10 YEAR ENDING IN JANUARY. THE GOVERNOR SAYS IT MARKS A

38:16 FULL RECOVERY FROM THE PANDEMIC PRAYED HEALTH CARE, LEISURE AND

38:19 HOSPITALITY DROVE THOSE GAINS MAINLY COMING FROM IF THE CUT

38:20 WHICH HAD 6% JOBS GROWTH.

38:26 RIVIAN HALTING PLANS ON A FACTORY IN GEORGIA.

38:30 THAT'S CAN GIVE THEM MORE THAN 2.25 BILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS.

38:34 THE MODEL WILL GO TO AN EXISTING PLANT IN ILLINOIS.

38:37 IT IS A CHEAPER MODEL SET TO COMPETE WITH TESLA.

38:45 THE TIRE FROM A BOEING 777 FLIGHT FELL OFF THE AIRCRAFT

38:47 SHORTLY AFTER TAKEOFF FROM SAN FRANCISCO.

38:52 THE JAPAN BOUND FLIGHTS ALL OF ITS -- SAW THAT IN THE EMPLOYEE

38:54 PARKING LOT. IT CAUSED MINOR DAMAGE AND

38:55 DEBRIS. IT PROMPTED AN EMERGENCY LANDING IN L.A..

39:00 THAT'S YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF. JONATHAN:

39:04 ALL THESE STORIES I THINK NEED A WARNING.

39:07 FOR ANYONE GOING THROUGH THE AIRPORT THIS MORNING IT'S LIKE

39:10 MORE AIRPLANE NEWS. LISA: I DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT MY

39:14 TIRE FALLING OFF THE AIRPLANE. JONATHAN:

39:17 RIDICULOUS PRAYED EQUITIES ABOUT UNCHANGED.

39:20 CHAIR POWELL AND SENATOR WARREN SQUARING OFF.

39:25 >> YOU WERE THE LEADER OF THE FED AND WHEN THE HEAT WAS ON

39:28 LAST YEAR YOU TALKED A LOT ABOUT GETTING TOUGH ON BANKS

39:32 AND NOW THE GIANT BANKS ARE UNHAPPY ABOUT THAT AND YOU'VE

39:33 GONE WEAK NEED ON THIS. JONATHAN:

39:41 I THINK IT'S A SOUNDBITE SAYING WE WON'T BE USING TODAY.

39:42 DID YOU SEE THAT? LISA: WHICH ONE? JONATHAN:

39:45 MY GOODNESS. THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

40:01 JONATHAN: I'VE GOT EVERYONE WRITING IN,

40:09 NO ONE WANTS THE KENNEDY -- THE WAR AND POWELL EXCHANGE EVERY

40:11 BUDDY WANTS THE KENNEDY POWELL EXCHANGE.

40:12 YOU CAN FIND IT FOR YOURSELF ON YOUTUBE.

40:15 I DON'T THINK WE ARE GOING TO PLAY AT.

40:20 YOU NEED SOME BLEEPS IN THERE. LISA: DOES IT MATTER GIVEN THE

40:23 SUBSTANCE? I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS JUST

40:28 DROPPING THE AFT BOMB BUT IT IS SO MUCH WORSE THAN THAT.

40:31 JONATHAN: SOMETIMES YOU CAN WAKE EVERYONE

40:34 UP. IT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.

40:37 LISA: DID YOU SEE JAY POWELL'S REACTION? NEXT TIME HE TALKS.

40:43 SO STRAIGHT ABOUT IT. EQUITIES RIGHT NOW ON THE S&P

40:46 JUST ABOUT UNCHANGED. ON YIELDS LOWER BY A BASIS

40:48 POINT. EURO NEGATIVE.

40:51 UNDER SURVEILLANCE THIS MORNING, CHAIR POWELL AND

40:59 SENATOR WARREN SQUARE OFF.

41:03 >> ARE YOU COMMITTED TO FINALIZING THE STRONGEST

41:07 VERSION OF THE RULES THIS YEAR?

41:10 >> WE ARE TAKING MANY MORE STEPS TO DEAL WITH PROBLEMS

41:13 WITH SILICON VALLEY BANK.

41:17 >> I'M ASKING ABOUT THE BASEL THREE RULES.

41:19 >> THEY ARE NOT DIRECTLY RELATED. MY VIEW IS IT WOULD BE

41:24 APPROPRIATE TO MAKE MATERIAL IN BROAD CHANGES.

41:27 >> TO STRENGTHEN THE RULES?

41:30 >> IF YOU READ IT AGAIN. YOU WILL SEE THAT I'M DOING

41:34 EXACTLY WHAT I SAID I WOULD DO.

41:40 >> WHEN THE HEAT WAS ON LAST YEAR YOU TALKED A LOT ABOUT

41:43 GETTING TOUGHER BUT NOW THE GIANT BANKS ARE UNHAPPY ABOUT

41:45 THAT AND YOU'VE GONE WEAK NEED ON THIS. JONATHAN:

41:51 FED CHAIR JAY POWELL ON CAPITOL HILL FACING QUESTIONS ABOUT

41:56 PROPOSALS TO BEND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS SAYING CENTRAL

42:00 BANK WON'T HESITATE TO ABANDON PARTICULAR RULES OR THE

42:02 PROPOSAL LAST YEAR PUT FORWARD AS OFFICIALS WORK TOWARDS A

42:05 CONSENSUS. MANAGING PRINCIPAL AT MRV

42:07 ASSOCIATES JOINS US. LET'S JUST GET STRAIGHT TO THE

42:14 RULES THEY WILL COME DOWN. CAN YOU HELP ME UNDERSTAND

42:16 WHAT'S ON THE TABLE RIGHT NOW? AND WHAT'S IT CAN LOOK LIKE IN

42:19 THE YEARS TO COME?

42:21 >> GOOD MORNING. THE BASEL THREE RULES ARE THAT

42:29 THE MEDIA REFERS TO AS ARE AN UPDATE TO VERY IMPORTANT

42:33 CAPITAL LIQUIDITY AND TRADING RULES.

42:36 >> THESE WERE ALREADY UPDATED BY OVER 20 COUNTRIES SEVERAL

42:41 YEARS AGO. THEY COULD NOT BE IMPLEMENTED

42:45 IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE UNDER THE PREVIOUS

42:47 ADMINISTRATION LET'S JUST SAY IT WAS DEFINITELY NOT FRIENDLY

42:52 TOWARDS REGULATION AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SAFETY OF

42:54 BANKS. SO A LOT OF THIS IS CAUSED

43:01 BECAUSE PREVIOUSLY BIG BANKS COULD USE THEIR OWN MODELS TO

43:03 DETERMINE THEIR OWN RISK RATES. CAN YOU IMAGINE IF YOU AND I

43:08 COULD DESIGN OUR OWN TESTS. OF COURSE WE WOULD GET AN A.

43:17 THIS UPDATE IS VERY MUCH A LONG OVERDUE AND CHAIR POWELL'S

43:22 COMMENTS YESTERDAY WERE A SURPRISE AND OF COURSE HE'S

43:26 ENTITLED TO HIS OPINION, BUT HIS COMMENTS WERE VERY

43:31 UNFORTUNATE. BANK LOBBYISTS ARE SALIVATING

43:34 AT THE IDEA OF WATERING DOWN REGULATIONS THAT ARE VERY

43:37 IMPORTANT TO THE ORDINARY AMERICANS SICK AND TIRED OF

43:40 BAILING OUT BANKS EVERY TIME THEY GET INTO TROUBLE. JONATHAN:

43:45 THERE HAVE BEEN -- LISA: THERE HAVE BEEN SOME SERIOUS

43:47 CRITICISMS ABOUT THE CURRENT RULES IN THEIR FORM AND HOW

43:51 THEY ARE OVERLY PUNITIVE, THEY DO NOT ACHIEVE WHAT THEY SET

43:54 OUT TO ACHIEVE WHICH IS TO QUICK CREDIT FOR THE AMERICAN

43:55 ECONOMY. DO YOU AGREE IT'S APPROPRIATE

43:59 TO ROLL BACK SOME OF THE PROPOSALS AS THEY WERE PUT OUT

44:04 THERE?

44:05 >> ABSOLUTELY NOT I THINK MOST OF THE CRITICISMS ARE NOT VALID.

44:12 TYPICAL, YOU'LL HEAR IS BANK REGULATIONS WILL REDUCE LENDING.

44:17 IF THAT WERE TRUE, WHERE IS THE DATA FROM THE BANK LOBBYISTS TO

44:20 SUPPORT THIS? AMERICAN BANKS HAVE GROWN IN

44:23 THEIR ASSETS AND WHAT OUR ASSETS?

44:24 WE ARE TALKING MOSTLY ABOUT LOANS.

44:31 THEY HAVE GROWN OVER 60% SINCE 2012 WHEN DODD-FRANK AND BASEL

44:33 THREE FIRST STARTED BEING IMPLEMENTED.

44:38 IF THESE RULES WERE PUNITIVE FOR THE AMERICAN ECONOMY, WHY

44:42 HAS IT CONTINUE TO GROW? THE AMERICAN ECONOMY HAS GROWN

44:47 ENORMOUSLY AS WE STAND HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE JUST ABOUT

44:53 EVERY ADVANCED ECONOMY.

44:54 IF THESE RULES REALLY DO AS THE BANK LOBBYISTS AND EXECUTIVES

44:58 SAY, WHY ARE THEY PAYING THE EXORBITANT LEVEL OF DIVIDENDS,

45:04 SHARE BUYBACKS, WHAT ABOUT THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THEY SPEND

45:05 IN FINES OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS? UNFORTUNATELY BANK LOBBYISTS

45:14 HAVE TO PRODUCE REAL DATA, THE REASON THEY ARE CRITICIZING

45:18 THESE RULES SO MUCH IS BECAUSE THERE WERE SO MUCH MONEY AT

45:24 STAKE. YOU ALSO HAVE TO REMEMBER IMPORTANTLY THERE'S ABOUT 500

45:29 FEDERAL BANKING LOBBYISTS WITH OVER $50 BILLION IN ASSETS SO

45:33 WHEN YOU AND I SEE REPEATEDLY NOT JUST ON TELEVISION OR

45:37 SOCIAL MEDIA EVEN AT BUS STOPS THE BANK LOBBYISTS HAVE TAKEN

45:42 TO ADVERTISING ABOUT THE SO-CALLED ILLS.

45:50 CONSUMER ADVOCATES CANNOT WITHSTAND THAT MILLIONS OF

45:55 DOLLARS THAT LOBBYISTS SPEND EVERY YEAR CRITICIZING ANY BANK

45:56 RULE. LISA: I'M OBVIOUSLY WAITING AT THE

45:59 WRONG BUS STOPS.

46:05 I THINK PUTTING ASIDE SOME OF THE DEBATE AROUND THE ROLE OF

46:08 CREDIT CREATION I'M CURIOUS ABOUT WHERE THE RISK CURRENTLY

46:10 LIES ON BANK BALANCE SHEETS. THE QUARTERLY REPORT CAME OUT

46:17 YESTERDAY AND IT REALLY HAD A SANGUINE PICTURE, A LOAN

46:18 DELINQUENCIES AND CHARGE-OFF RATES WERE PRETTY LOW.

46:21 THE QUESTION WAS COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE.

46:24 AND CREDIT CARD LOANS. DO YOU SEE REAL MATERIAL RISK

46:29 IN ANY WAY BUILDING ON THESE BANK BALANCE SHEETS? MAYRA:

46:34 YOU ARE CORRECT, THERE'S ALWAYS RISKS AND YET DELIMITS THE

46:40 RATES OF CREDIT CARDS HAVE BEEN GOING UP, YOU OF CORPORATE

46:41 DEFAULT RATES RISING. THIS IS A TOPIC I'VE BEEN

46:48 TALKING ABOUT FOR OVER A DECADE BECAUSE AMERICAN CORPORATIONS

46:49 ARE PRACTICALLY AT RECORD LEVELS OF INDEBTEDNESS.

46:53 WITH CONTINUED ELEVATED LEVELS OF INTEREST RATES, ABSOLUTELY

46:56 WE SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT THOSE RISKS ON THE BALANCE

47:02 SHEET AND PRECISELY BECAUSE THERE'S THOSE RISKS AND ALSO

47:04 CYBERSECURITY THREATS, THE FACT BANKS ARE NOT TAKING INTO

47:10 ACCOUNT HOW CLIMATE CHANGE CAN IMPACT THEM, IT IS PRECISELY

47:12 THE KNOWN RISKS AND THE ONES THAT ARE HARD TO MEASURE THAT

47:18 THIS IS ABSOLUTELY NOT THE TIME TO REQUIRE LESS FROM BANKS AND

47:22 THIS ALSO MEANS BANK SUPERVISORS HAVE TO DO THEIR

47:27 JOB, THE CULTURE AT THE TOP OF THESE BANK REGULATORY ENTITIES

47:35 CHANGED DRAMATICALLY BECAUSE OF TRUMPS 2155.

47:37 THAT'S WHY SILICON VALLEY BANK WAS NOT MEASURING LIQUIDITY

47:39 UNDER STRESS CONDITIONS. ABSOLUTELY LET'S PUT EVERYTHING

47:45 ON THE TABLE, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE REAL REFORMS NEEDED TO

47:50 PROTECT ORDINARY AMERICAN TAXPAYERS AND LET'S TALK ABOUT

47:53 THE FACT THAT YOU'VE GOT TO FOLLOW THE MONEY.

47:55 ALL OF THESE COMPLAINTS ARE ABOUT THE FACT THAT BANK

48:01 EXECUTIVES AND MANY BANKERS COMPENSATION IS AFFECTED BY

48:05 BANK REGULATION BECAUSE YES, CAPITAL DOES COST. JONATHAN:

48:09 I THINK YOU WILL FIND A GOOD FRIEND IN THE SENATOR OF

48:16 MASSACHUSETTS. THANK YOU.

48:17 I THINK THEY ARE PROBABLY ON THE SAME PAGE. LISA:

48:21 I WONDER ABOUT ELIZABETH WARREN IN TERMS OF WHAT LEVEL IS

48:23 ENOUGH FOR SOME OF THE REGULATION.

48:28 THIS IS THE ULTIMATE QUESTION AND THE REAL QUESTION IS WHAT

48:31 ROLE SHOULD THE BANKS PLAY VERSUS THE SHADOW BANKING

48:33 SYSTEM. THERE'S A BIGGER DEBATE HERE

48:40 OBVIOUSLY WE ARE NOT HAVING PRAYED -- NOT HAVING. JONATHAN:

48:46 WHERE IS THE PROBLEM WITH CRE IF IT BECOMES A MUCH BIGGER

48:47 ISSUE. IT'S ELSEWHERE.

48:53 >> DO YOU REGULATE MORE HEAVILY THE SMALLER BANKS?

48:56 DO YOU MAKE THEM SO THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO DO MUCH?

49:02 DO YOU PROHIBIT THEM FROM TYING TOGETHER TO BECOME BIGGER BANKS.

49:06 IT CREATES THIS LACK OF CONSISTENCY IN THE POLICIES.

49:09 >> PEOPLE GET VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS STUFF.

49:15 COMING UP THE BRILLIANT LIBBY CANTRELL OF PIMCO, ELLEN OF

49:19 MORGAN STANLEY AND CONGRESSWOMAN DEBBIE DINGELL OF

49:21 MICHIGAN. GOOD MORNING.

49:42 >> THE ECONOMY IS TURNING OUT TO BE REMARKABLY RESILIENT IN

49:43 THE FACE OF CHALLENGES.

49:45 >> WE CONTINUE TO HAVE STRONGER U.S.

49:49 GROWTH AND THE EXCEPTIONALISM STORY KEEPS COMING BACK.

49:53 >> RIGHT NOW I STILL SEE THAT RISK OF RE-A CELEBRATION LOW.

49:57 -- REACCELERATION.

50:01 >> WE ARE IN THE ZONE OF REASONABLENESS.

50:07 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE WITH JONATHAN

50:10 FERRO, LISA ABRAMOWICZ AND ANNMARIE HORDERN.

50:14 >> THE SECOND HOUR OF BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE BEGINS RIGHT NOW.

50:16 GOOD MORNING.

50:22 IT IS PAYROLLS FRIDAY, THE ESTIMATE ON OUR SURVEY, THE

50:26 PREVIOUS NUMBER 353 THOUSAND. WHAT A DIFFERENCE A MONTH MAKES.

50:31 THINKING ABOUT WHAT KIND OF DOWNSIDE SURPRISE TO BRING THE

50:32 RATE CUT INTO PLAY. WE ARE SITTING HERE WAITING FOR

50:37 PAYROLLS WONDERING WHAT UPSIDE SURPRISE IT WOULD TAKE TO BLOW

50:40 OUT THE FORECAST OF ANY RATE CUT THIS TIME THIS YEAR.

50:45 >> THE QUESTION IS HAVE WE TRULY TAKEN OFF THE IDEA OF

50:48 RE-ACCELERATING INFLATION OFF THE TABLE.

50:54 THERE WAS A SURVEY CONDUCTED THAT SHOWS 50% OF INVESTORS

50:56 THINK THE PAYROLL DATA WOULD BE RISK ON.

50:59 34% SAID MIXED OR NEGLIGIBLE. THIS IS BASICALLY EVERYONE WINS

51:05 THIS IS GOOD TO BE GREAT, AND NO ONE'S POSITION FOR WEAKNESS.

51:08 JONATHAN: WONDERFUL. LISA: HEADS I WIN, TAILS I WIN.

51:13 IT'S GOLDILOCKS FOREVER. JONATHAN:

51:20 THERE'S A DIFFERENCE WOULD YOU WELCOME LOOSENING IN THE MARKET.

51:21 AND AN UNWELCOME DETERIORATION. WHAT SEPARATES, OR DIVIDES THE

51:25 ISSUE.

51:29 >> IT'S AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION.

51:34 THE ISSUE IS THERE ARE NO SIDES OF A HEALTHY DETERIORATION IN

51:35 THE MARKET. ON THE MARGINS QUITS ARE DOWN

51:40 YOU CAN SEE IN PLACES PEOPLE AREN'T HIRING AS MUCH.

51:44 IT'S NOT COMING IN THE NUMBERS. ANECDOTALLY PEOPLE'S WAGES ARE

51:48 GOING UP IN TERMS OF REAL WAGES PAID IT'S HARD TO MAKE THIS

51:51 BEARISH CASE.

51:52 >> PRESIDENT BIDEN SING THE SAME THING IN THE STATE OF THE

51:54 UNION. OUR ECONOMY IS THE ENVY OF THE

51:56 WORLD. I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE 3%.

52:03 DIRECTION OF TRAVEL BETTER. IMPROVING.

52:08 >> PSYCHOLOGY DOESN'T MOVE AS FAST AS STATISTICS.

52:13 AND SOME PEOPLE SAY WHEN THEIR BILLS ARE HIGHER IT TAKES TIME

52:14 FOR THEM TO SHAKE OUT. HOW MANY PAYMENTS CAN YOU GIVE

52:18 SOMEONE BEFORE THEY SAY IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

52:22 WHAT MORE CAN BE DONE IN THE FISCAL FRONT HEADING INTO

52:26 NOVEMBER TO SPEED UP THE PROCESS FEELING A LITTLE MORE

52:31 OPTIMISTIC. JONATHAN: HOUSES ARE UNAFFORDABLE.

52:33 IT'S NOT UNIQUE TO AMERICA, IT'S SOMETHING WE SEE IN THE

52:35 UNITED KINGDOM. WHY DO POLITICIANS ALWAYS REACH

52:40 FOR WE WILL GIVE YOU EXTRA MONEY.

52:43 ARE YOU SEEING THIS MASSIVE INITIATIVE TO BUILD MORE HOMES

52:46 PARTICULAR HOW MUCH SPACE IS IN A COUNTRY LIKE THE UNITED

52:48 STATES OF AMERICA. THERE IS ENOUGH SPACE TO BUILD

52:50 MORE HOMES. LISA: PEOPLE WANT THEIR CAKE AND THEY

52:53 WANT TO EAT IT TOO. THEY WANT TO HAVE AFFORDABLE

52:57 HOMES BUT DON'T WANT ANYONE IN THEIR BACK YARD SO YOU PUT

53:02 THOSE TOGETHER AND RING UP SOME PRETTY CONFLICTED POLICIES.

53:06 I'M NOT SURE WHAT CAN I THROUGH BEFORE NOVEMBER, WHAT I'M

53:09 LOOKING FOR IS POLICY PRESCRIPTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN

53:10 THE BACKBONES OF THE RALLY WE'VE SEEN. JONATHAN:

53:14 THIS IS WHAT IT'S ABOUT IN THE U.K..

53:19 NO POLITICIAN IN THE UNITED KINGDOM WANTS HOUSE PRICES TO

53:23 GO DOWN BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO OWN THOSE HOMES WHO SEE THAT

53:25 ASSET IS A BIG PERCENTAGE OF THEIR OVERALL WEALTH THOSE OF

53:28 THE PEOPLE WHO GO TO THE POLLS AND VOTE.

53:32 EVERY TIME THERE'S AN ELECTION THEY VOTE AND THEY JUDGE HOW

53:35 WELL IT'S DOING BY THE VALUE OF THE HOME THEY ARE NEVER GOING

53:38 TO SELL AND IF THEY DO THEY WANT TO SELL IT TO MILLENNIALS

53:39 FOR A WHOLE LOT MORE MONEY. THIS IS GENERATIONAL WARFARE IN

53:42 THE HOUSING MARKET. THIS IS A BIG ISSUE AND THEY

53:50 ALWAYS REACH FOR DEMAND-SIDE SOLUTIONS WHICH EXACERBATES THE

53:51 PROBLEM INSTEAD OF BUILDING MORE HOUSES. LISA:

53:54 THAT'S VERY WELL SAID. HOUSEHOLD U.S.

54:00 WEALTH IS AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH AND CLIMBING DRAMATICALLY IN

54:01 PART BECAUSE HOUSE PRICES HAVE NOT GONE DOWN.

54:08 TO YOUR POINT WHAT YOU WANT, YOU WANT MORE AFFORDABILITY OR

54:11 REALLY THIS CONTINUED RISE IN PRICES? JONATHAN:

54:13 WAITING FOR THE HATE MAIL.

54:16 IF YOU HATE ME, TK IS ON THE RADIO, COMMISERATE WITH EACH

54:22 OTHER. S&P FUTURES LOOK LIKE THIS.

54:26 NEGATIVE ON THE S&P 500. YIELDS ARE LOWER BY A SINGLE

54:28 BASIS POINT.

54:34 THE FX MARKET EURO-DOLLAR, 1.0933.

54:38 EXPECTING THE FED TO CUT IN JUNE. BIDEN STATE OF THE UNION.

54:45 LOOKING FOR A PAYROLLS PRINT OF 205 K FOR THE FED TO START

54:46 CUTTING IN JUNE. WE BEGIN WITH OUR TOP STORY THE

54:50 FED PAYROLLS REPORT ABOUT 90 MINUTES AWAY AFTER A PLOT

54:54 JANUARY PRINT. THEY RETURN TO A MORE NORMAL

54:57 PACE OF JOB GROWTH SAYING I THINK THE ECONOMY IS SLOWING

55:03 AND INFLATION IS SLOWLY MATURING GETTING TO 2%.

55:07 I THINK THE FED WANTS TO CUT TO GET INTO SOFT LANDING MODE.

55:10 I THINK THE FED WILL START CUTTING IN JUNE AND CUT FOUR

55:14 TIMES IN 24 AND 25. NOT TO TALK ABOUT HOUSE PRICES.

55:18 WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THIS MARKET.

55:21 WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN THE MONTHS TO COME?

55:26 >> IT WAS INTERESTING, IT WAS WHAT HE DID NOT SAY THAT WAS

55:28 MORE INTERESTING THAN WHAT HE SAID.

55:32 WHAT HE SAID WAS CONSISTENT AT THE JANUARY FED MEETING.

55:36 A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THE SAME DATA AND WHEN I SAY SAME DATA

55:39 IT'S INFLATION HEADING LOWER.

55:47 WE GET ZERO OR .2, WE GET PCE CLOSE TO 3%.

55:49 I THINK THAT'S LOWER THAN WHERE WE WERE.

55:53 THE BAR FOR THE FED TO START TO CUT IS LARGELY FROM THE

55:55 INFLATION FRONT JUST SHOWING CONTINUED MODERATION.

56:00 I THINK A COUPLE MONTHS OF INFLATION NUMBERS SUGGESTING

56:03 THE 2% IS WITHIN REACH IS ENOUGH FOR THEM TO CUT.

56:08 I THINK CUTTING NEXT YEAR WILL REQUIRE POTENTIALLY GETTING

56:12 CLOSE TO 2% OR GETTING A BIGGER IN THE LABOR MARKET.

56:14 IT'S REALLY NOT ABOUT GROWTH.

56:18 >> CHAIRMAN POWELL SAID WE ARE NOT SCARED OF STRONG GROWTH.

56:22 IF WE GET ANOTHER BIG PAYROLLS REPORT SHOULD THEY BE WORRIED

56:23 ABOUT THAT? PRIYA: I THINK IT WILL MAKE THIS

56:29 REACCELERATION TALK LOUDER BUT IT'S MUCH MORE ABOUT WAGES.

56:36 IF YOU GET 300 GOING TO WAGES I THINK THAT WILL STAY VERY MUCH

56:38 ALIVE BECAUSE IT SUGGESTS SERVICE INFLATION WILL COME

56:44 DOWN.

56:44 IT ALLOWS THE FED TO START NORMALIZING THE START OF CUTS

56:46 IS NOT ABOUT EASING IT'S ABOUT NORMALIZING.

56:52 YOU GET ANOTHER POINT, I THINK THEN THE MARKET GETS VERY

56:55 NERVOUS THAT THESE CUTS IN THE SECOND HALF WE HAVE THE

56:56 ELECTION.

57:02 >> IT STRIKES ME THERE IS AN IMPLICIT THESIS BUILDING INTO

57:06 THE CONSENSUS AND THAT IS THAT THIS YEAR THE FED WILL BE

57:10 PROACTIVE AND TRY TO GET AHEAD OF CUTTING RATES BECAUSE OF

57:13 DISINFLATION. BUT NEXT YEAR IS WHEN YOU HAVE

57:15 REAL REFINANCING RISK AND YOU SEE ACTUAL RISK.

57:18 THAT'S WHEN THE EFFECTS, INTO THE FLOOR IN A MUCH MORE

57:19 MATERIAL WAY. IS THAT CONSISTENT WITH WHAT

57:22 YOU FEEL? PRIYA: I DON'T THINK THE CUTS ARE

57:25 LARGELY ABOUT INFLATION. NEXT YEAR WILL BE ABOUT GROWTH.

57:29 IF THERE ARE NO SIGNS OF THAT LAG. THEY ARE SURE ON THOSE CUTS

57:31 NEXT YEAR. THOSE LAG START TO SHOW UP.

57:36 THEY COULD SPEED UP THE RATE CUTS.

57:42 EVEN IF THEY CUT THREE TIMES THIS YEAR WE ARE AT 4.5, IT IS

57:44 FAIRLY HIGH. THAT'S VERY HIGH REAL RATES.

57:50 IF THEY DON'T SEE SIGNS OF THE LABOR MARKET MONTHLY PAYROLLS

57:53 THAT COULD MAKE THEM THINK THAT'S GOOD TO MOVE THE

57:56 EMPLOYMENT RATE HIGHER, RECESSIONS ARE ALWAYS NONLINEAR.

58:00 IF YOU SEE A MATERIAL WEAKENING IN THE LABOR MARKET THEY WILL

58:02 EXTRAPOLATE THAT AND START TO CUT MUCH FASTER.

58:04 A LONG WAY TO GET TO NEUTRAL. THIS IS TWO-SIDED.

58:12 DEPENDING ON HOW THE LABOR MARKET THEY CAN SPEED UP THOSE

58:13 CUTS AND SLOW IT DOWN.

58:17 >> DO YOU THINK THE RISKS ARE ADEQUATELY PRICED NOW IN THE

58:19 MARKET. IT SEEMS A VERY FEW PEOPLE ARE

58:27 EXPECTING INFLATION, THEY ARE EXPECTING CUTS AND EXPECT THEM

58:29 TO CONTINUE. DO YOU THINK THERE HASN'T BEEN

58:32 ENOUGH OF THE POSSIBILITY OF A TRULY RESILIENT ECONOMY BAKED

58:35 INTO THIS MARKET? PRIYA: I THINK THE BOND MARKET MIGHT

58:39 BE PRICING THAT IN. IF THEY ACTUALLY ACCELERATE WE

58:46 THE BOND MARKET PRICING PRICING THE ENDPOINT AFTER THE CUTS

58:48 AROUND 3.5. THAT TO ME IS CONSISTENT WITH

58:49 SOFT LANDING.

58:58 YES U.S. RATES CAN RISE 25 OR 30 BASIS

59:00 POINTS BUT WHERE ARE EQUITIES? THE SOFT LANDING STARTS TO BE

59:05 QUESTIONED WHICH IS PRICE TO PERFECTION IN EVERY MARKET.

59:10 IF THE FED CAN CUT ANYMORE NEXT YEAR, I THINK SOME OF THE RISK

59:12 PREMIUMS IN SOME OF THE RISKIEST PART OF THE MARKET IS

59:15 TOO LOW AT THAT POINT. REAL RATES WILL BE HIGH.

59:19 DOES IT MEAN A HARD LANDING IN 26?

59:27 I THINK THE RISK ASSET COMPLEX MIGHT BE MORE AT RISK IN SORT

59:30 OF REACCELERATION. JONATHAN: MAYBE YOU ARE CONSTRUCTIVE ON

59:36 TREASURIES FURTHER OUT ON THE CURVE BUT LESS SO ON CORPORATE

59:37 CREDIT. IS THAT FAIR? PRIYA: WE ARE VERY MUCH IN A SOFT

59:44 LANDING AND IF THE FED DOES DELIVER ON THESE CUTS NEXT

59:47 YEAR, THE CUTS THIS YEAR IF THE ECONOMY SLOWS DOWN BUT DOESN'T

59:50 HOLD TO A RECESSION I THINK CORPORATE CREDIT SPREADS ARE

59:53 TIGHT FOR GOOD REASON. THE SOFT LANDING CONTINUES.

01:00:00 MAKING SURE WANT SOME TREASURES, I THINK THAT'S HOW I

01:00:02 WOULD PLAY IT RIGHT NOW.

01:00:08 IF THINGS SLOW DOWN MORE IF THINGS START TO RE-ACCELERATE I

01:00:12 THINK THEN YOU GO ALONG MUCH FURTHER ON TREASURIES.

01:00:18 >> JUST TO SORT OF DOUBLE DOWN ON THESE POINTS, WHY GET INTO

01:00:21 INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT WITH SPREADS THAT ARE SO TIGHT.

01:00:23 LONG-DURATION TREASURIES.

01:00:29 >> THERE'S A FUNDAMENTAL REASON, FUNDAMENTALS OF

01:00:32 CORPORATE CREDIT ARE STILL STRONG YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE

01:00:33 YOU KNOW WHAT YOU OWN. IF THE BALANCE SHEET OF THESE

01:00:36 COMPANIES ARE STRONG.

01:00:42 THEY'VE ACTUALLY TURNED OUT DEBT , I THINK THOSE SPREADS

01:00:45 REFLECT THE ENGINE RISK AND CORPORATE CREDIT.

01:00:51 THEY'VE BEEN NERVOUS ABOUT THAT HIKE.

01:00:56 IF THE HIKES ARE DONE THAT IS STARTING TO MOVE OUT AND THEN

01:00:59 ONLY 6% YIELD IS ATTRACTIVE. OWNING CORPORATE CREDIT STILL

01:01:02 MAKES SENSE. JONATHAN: JOHN WILLIAMS PARTICIPATING IN

01:01:06 A POLICY DISCUSSION RIGHT NOW. MY QUOTE OF THE WEEK FROM THE

01:01:09 FED SPEAKER. COMING FROM NEEL KASHKARI OF

01:01:13 THE MINNEAPOLIS FED. I THINK IT'S A GREAT QUESTION.

01:01:19 IF WE WERE RUN RATE IT'S VERY ATTRACTIVE.

01:01:25 WHY DO ANYTHING IS THE QUESTION HE'S ANSWERING.

01:01:32 -- ASKING BRADEN >> POTENTIALLY SAYING MORE CUTS.

01:01:37 ESSENTIALLY WHY HAVE MORE. RIGHT NOW THE DATA IS SCREAMING

01:01:40 STRENGTH. I WELCOME THE CONTRARIAN

01:01:44 THOUGHT. THAT'S WHERE IT'S PUSHING.

01:01:52 JONATHAN: PRIYA STAYING WITH US. LET'S GET YOU AN UPDATE ON

01:01:59 STORIES THIS MORNING. HERE'S A BLOOMBERG BRIEF WITH

01:02:02 DANI BURGER. DANI: ELI LILLY FACING FURTHER DELAYS.

01:02:10 THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION WILL HOLD AN

01:02:13 ADVISORY PANEL TO FURTHER EVALUATE THE SITE SAFETY AND

01:02:17 EFFICACY OF THE TREATMENT PRAYED IT'S A SURPRISE

01:02:19 ANNOUNCEMENT FROM THE FDA WHICH IS WHY IT IS EXPECTED TO RULE

01:02:21 ON APPROVING THE DRUG IN THE COMING WEEKS.

01:02:26 KRISTA LEAN OPPOSED TO SECURE SUPPORT FOR A SECOND FIVE-YEAR

01:02:28 TERM AS IMF MANAGING DIRECTOR. SHE HAS THE BACKING OF -- TO

01:02:33 ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF ANY POTENTIAL BID.

01:02:38 WORKING IN PURSUIT OF US SECOND TERM UNDERSTANDING SHE IS THE

01:02:40 SUPPORT OF FRANCE AND GERMANY.

01:02:47 THE CHIPMAKER IS UP 3% IN THE PREMARKET TRADE AND PUTS IT ON

01:02:49 TRACK FOR SEVEN STRAIGHT DAYS OF GAINS.

01:02:53 IT ALSO ADDED MORE THAN $1 TRILLION IN VALUE THIS YEAR

01:02:55 ALONE. INCHING CLOSER TO SURPASSING

01:02:59 APPLE'S MARKET CAP. THE MARKET CAP IS FALLEN

01:03:03 SIGNIFICANTLY BUT WOULD MAKE IT THE WORLD'S SECOND-BIGGEST

01:03:05 COMPANY. THAT'S YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF.

01:03:09 JONATHAN: THE MAN WHO SHALL NOT BE NAMED.

01:03:13 >> MY PREDECESSOR. MY PREDECESSOR. MY PREDECESSOR.

01:03:20 IT NEVER OCCURRED TO MY PREDECESSOR.

01:03:23 FAILING THE MOST BASIC PRESIDENTIAL DUTY. JONATHAN:

01:03:27 I SAID EARLIER THIS WAS LIKE BALTIMORE FOR DEMOCRATS.

01:03:29 WE MIGHT GET A YEAR OF THIS. FROM NEW YORK CITY THIS IS

01:03:34 BLOOMBERG. ♪

01:03:55 JONATHAN:

01:04:02 LOOKS LIKE JORDAN PETERSON WITH BRAMO IN THE BREAK.

01:04:07 I WASN'T JORDAN BY THE WAY, BRAMO WAS.

01:04:10 EQUITY FUTURES NEGATIVE, YIELDS DOWN A BASIS POINT. 4.07%.

01:04:16 UNDER SURVEILLANCE THE PREDECESSOR WHO SHALL NOT BE

01:04:17 NAMED.

01:04:23 >> NOW MY PREDECESSOR, A FORMER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT TELLS

01:04:24 PUTIN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT. MY PREDECESSOR DETERMINED TO

01:04:29 SEE THAT OVERTURNED. MY PREDECESSOR AND MANY IN THIS

01:04:34 CHAMBER WANT TO TAKE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AWAY.

01:04:39 MY PREDECESSOR SAID HE'S PROUD HE DID NOTHING ON GUNS.

01:04:44 ALL THE TOUGH TALK ON CHINA NEVER OCCURRED ON MY PRESIDENT

01:04:47 -- PREDECESSOR TO DO ANYTHING. JONATHAN:

01:04:49 IT'S THE LATEST, PRESIDENT BIDEN RELATING TO DONALD TRUMP

01:04:54 WITHOUT EVER SAYING HIS NAME. DURING HIS SPIRITED STATE OF

01:04:59 THE UNION ADDRESS SETTING THE STAGE FOR A REMATCH IN NOVEMBER.

01:05:05 GOOD MORNING TO YOU. YOU SAT THROUGH THAT I'M SURE.

01:05:09 IS THIS GOOD TO BE THE YEAR AHEAD.

01:05:14 TALK ABOUT THE PREDECESSOR BUT NOT MENTION HIS NAME?

01:05:17 >> THIS WAS A VERY PARTISAN STATE OF THE UNION FOR SURE.

01:05:21 THIS WAS EFFECTIVELY THE OPENING SALVO FOR THE

01:05:23 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. BIDEN WAS REALLY TRYING TO

01:05:27 ESTABLISH A CONTRAST BETWEEN HIM AND THE PREDECESSOR.

01:05:30 ON THINGS LIKE ABORTION RIGHTS, FISCAL POLICY AND FOREIGN

01:05:34 POLICY. MORE IMPORTANTLY WHAT HE SAID

01:05:37 WAS HOW HE SAID IT. IT WAS SPIRITED, HE WAS VERY

01:05:42 ENERGETIC AND GIVEN THE QUESTIONS AROUND HIS AGE AND

01:05:45 HIS MENTAL COMPETENCE THIS SHOULD ASSUAGE PARTICULARLY HIS

01:05:50 BASE WHO WAS GETTING MORE CONCERNED THAT HE WASN'T UP FOR

01:05:52 THE JOB. JONATHAN: LISA'S LEAST FAVORITE TOPIC WAS

01:05:57 GOOD TO BE THE PERFORMANCE. LISA:

01:06:07 MY ISSUE IS PEOPLE WILL SAY IT SPIRITED, SOME SAY IT SHOWS

01:06:10 ENERGY, OTHERS SAY HE SCREAMING INTO THE MIKE.

01:06:13 HOW DOES THAT HELP THE PERSPECTIVE. JONATHAN:

01:06:18 WHAT CAME OUT OF THIS WITH THAT WAS INSTRUCTIVE? LIBBY:

01:06:23 IT WAS MORE ABOUT FISCAL POLICY THAN WHAT WE WERE EXPECTING.

01:06:28 THE WHITE HOUSE RELEASED A FACT SHEET OF SOME OF THE FISCAL

01:06:29 POLICY PRIORITIES. THE MOST DETAIL WE'VE GOTTEN

01:06:35 FROM THE WHITE HOUSE OR FROM THE CAMPAIGN IN TERMS OF WHAT A

01:06:37 SECOND TERM AGENDA WOULD LOOK LIKE.

01:06:41 HE DID LEAN INTO THIS IDEA OF FREEZING THE CORPORATE TAX RATE

01:06:47 AND THAT FACT SHEET TO 28%. HE ALSO TALKED ABOUT EXPANSION

01:06:51 OF THE TILED -- CHILD TAX CREDIT.

01:06:56 AND IN ADDITION TO A WHOLE HOST OF ISSUES.

01:07:00 I THINK THIS IS WHERE WE ARE GUIDING OUR CLIENTS IS IT WOULD

01:07:03 NEED TO SEPARATE THE RHETORIC FROM REALITY.

01:07:08 THE REALITY IS IF HE DOES GET REELECTED, WHAT IS THE

01:07:09 COMPOSITION OF CONGRESS LOOKING LIKE? IT IS IMPORTANT.

01:07:19 IF WE HAVE A SPLIT CONGRESS, IF THE SENATE FLIPS FROM

01:07:20 DEMOCRATIC-CONTROLLED TO REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED.

01:07:23 , IF THE HOUSES FLIPS FROM REPUBLICAN CONTROL TO

01:07:29 DEMOCRATIC CONTROL. IT'S IMPORTANT AGAIN TO

01:07:34 SEPARATE THE RHETORIC FROM THE REALITY AND UNDERSTAND IT WILL

01:07:36 DEPEND ON THE COMPOSITION OF CONGRESS. LISA:

01:07:38 I FOUND THE MOST INTERESTING PART OF THE SPEECH WHAT HE SAID

01:07:43 ABOUT CHINA. THE FACT THIS IS THE ONE AREA

01:07:46 ALMOST CERTAINLY GOING TO CONTINUE HEATING UP REGARDLESS

01:07:49 OF WHO IS PRESIDENT IN A WAY WE HAVE MAYBE FULLY APPRECIATED.

01:07:54 THE MOST ADVANCED AMERICAN TECHNOLOGIST CAN BE USED IN

01:07:58 CHINA'S WEAPONS.

01:08:00 IT NEVER OCCURRED TO MY PREDECESSOR, I WANT COMPETITION

01:08:05 WITH CHINA.

01:08:06 WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU. THIS WILL HEAT UP AT A TIME OR

01:08:08 WE SEE CHINA SAYING IT WILL STRIP AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY FROM

01:08:11 SOME OF THE IN THE NEXT DECADE OR SO.

01:08:15 >> THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION TO TRY TO PUT A FLOOR UNDER THIS

01:08:18 IT -- UNDER THIS RELATIONSHIP.

01:08:25 HOWEVER, THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY ARE NOT GOING TO CONTINUE WITH

01:08:30 SOME OF THEIR MORE TACTICAL MEASURES AGAINST CHINA

01:08:34 INCLUDING EXPORT CONTROLS INCLUDING A CONTINUATION OF

01:08:38 TARIFFS AND WHAT HAVE YOU.

01:08:41 I DO THINK THERE WILL BE A BIG CONTRAST BETWEEN TRUMP AND

01:08:42 BIDEN ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AROUND CHINA.

01:08:45 BIDEN WAS QUICK TO SAY HE WANTS COMPETITION NOT CONFLICT.

01:08:52 PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS VERY MUCH TALKING ABOUT 60% TARIFFS, I

01:08:55 THINK WE HAVE TO TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD.

01:08:57 HE HAS A LOT OF AUTHORITY TO DO THAT.

01:09:01 I DO THINK WE ARE -- WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO SEE THESE TENSIONS.

01:09:07 I THINK A BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WILL LOOK QUITE DIFFERENT THAN

01:09:12 A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. LISA:

01:09:14 I WONDER IF YOU CAN HAVE A REAL CALIBRATED RESPONSE WITHOUT A

01:09:16 MORE AGGRESSIVE TIT FOR TAT. CAN YOU CONTROL HOW FAR THIS

01:09:20 GOES GIVEN THE FACT IT CAN ESCALATE PRETTY QUICKLY GIVEN

01:09:25 BOTH SIDES ARE DOING THE SAME THING TO CATER TO THEIR

01:09:30 ELECTORATES.

01:09:31 LIBBY: WHILE TRUMP WAS STRONG ON CHINA

01:09:32 WHAT HE WAS FOCUSED ON WAS THE TARIFFS.

01:09:36 PRESIDENT BIDEN MAY BE SOFTER ON THE RHETORIC IN THE

01:09:37 BEGINNING. HE WAS FOCUSED ON CONTINUING

01:09:43 THE TARIFFS BUT ALSO THE EXPORT CONTROLS AND THE OUTBOUND

01:09:46 CAPITAL EXECUTIVE ORDER WE'VE SEEN FROM THAT ADMINISTRATION.

01:09:50 IN SOME WAYS FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE HE'S BEEN ALMOST

01:09:55 TOUGHER ON CHINA BUT I DO THINK THE TEMPERATURE OF THE

01:09:57 RELATIONSHIP WILL MATTER AND WILL DEPEND ON THE RHETORIC AND

01:10:01 I THINK IT WILL BE HOTTER AS WE GET INTO THE ELECTION. JONATHAN:

01:10:05 IT SOUNDS LIKE BIGGER BUDGET DEFICITS AND A PROBLEM FOR THE

01:10:08 TREASURY MARKET.

01:10:09 PRIYA: POLITICAL RISK IS BINARY VERY

01:10:11 HARD TO PRICE IN. ON THE INFLATION POINT OF NOT

01:10:15 SO SURE. IF WE LOOK AT THE BASKET, 75

01:10:21 PERCENT OF THAT IS SERVICES SO IT WILL BE DRIVEN BY WHAT'S

01:10:23 HAPPENING ON RENT INFLATION WHICH IS SLOWING.

01:10:29 THE LAST CPI REPORT WE THINK IT WAS ONE HAVE TO SCAN IT

01:10:30 CONTINUE TO COME BACK DOWN. IT'S GOOD TO BE ABOUT HOUSING,

01:10:33 AUTO INSURANCE. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THOSE

01:10:37 COMPONENTS OF SERVICE INFLATION AND WAGES.

01:10:42 IF THAT CONTINUES TO SLOW DOWN, GOODS INFLATION IS GONE BACK TO

01:10:46 PEAK OVER LEVELS WHERE DEFLATION THERE'S A LITTLE MORE

01:10:48 UP ON THAT FRONT AND MAYBE SOME PRICE LEVEL MOVE RATHER THAN

01:10:51 CONTINUED INFLATION. I DON'T THINK IT CHANGES

01:10:56 OVERALL INFLATION BECAUSE WE ARE STILL A VERY SERVICE DRIVEN

01:10:57 ECONOMY. LISA: IS THIS DECOUPLING OF THE U.S.

01:11:04 AND CHINA DISINFLATIONARY OR INFLATIONARY? LIBBY:

01:11:09 WE HAD OUR CYCLICAL ECONOMIC FOREMAN WE HAD THIS EXACT

01:11:12 DISCUSSION ABOUT THE U.S. CHINA RELATIONSHIP, BUT

01:11:16 POTENTIAL IMMIGRATION REFORMS OF TRUMP WERE ELECTED,

01:11:17 POTENTIAL TARIFFS. IS THIS JUST INFLATIONARY OR

01:11:24 DOES THIS HAVE CONSEQUENCES FOR GROWTH AS WELL BECAUSE WHEN YOU

01:11:28 CAN SEE IF THERE ARE MORE DRACONIAN TARIFFS ON CHINA IF

01:11:32 IT'S A 60% ACROSS-THE-BOARD TARIFF ON CHINA GOODS THAT

01:11:37 COULD PROBABLY BE INFLATIONARY BUT FOR GROWTH PERSPECTIVE IT

01:11:39 ACTUALLY IS IMPACTING GDP. I WILL SAY THAT THE MARKET

01:11:47 LIKES TO EXTRAPOLATE FROM THESE HEADLINES, THE DEVIL WILL BE IN

01:11:51 THE DETAILS EITHER ADMINISTRATION OF PRESIDENT

01:11:54 BIDEN OR PRESIDENT TRUMP WE ARE CAUTIONING CLIENTS IT IS

01:11:55 ACTUALLY TOO EARLY AS WELL. TO SORT OF MAKE ANY SORT OF

01:11:59 ADJUSTMENTS. THEY ARE SO ENGAGED.

01:12:10 EVERYONE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT -- THEY ARE TWO ENGAGED.

01:12:13 WE LOVE OUR CLIENTS.

01:12:19 WE LOVE TALKING TO OUR CLIENTS BUT USUALLY AT THIS POINT WE

01:12:23 USUALLY HAVE A PRIMARY CYCLE CONTINUING SO WE ARE NOT

01:12:26 ALREADY PIVOTING TO THE GENERAL ELECTION SO THE FACT WE ARE

01:12:28 ALREADY TALKING ABOUT THE MARKET AND POLICY LOCATIONS OF

01:12:31 THIS, IT IS VERY EARLY. IT IS STILL VERY EARLY SO DON'T

01:12:38 EXTRAPOLATE TOO MUCH FROM THE HEAD-TO-HEAD POLLING. JONATHAN:

01:12:45 SONY PEOPLE GOT IT SO WRONG IN NOVEMBER OF 2016.

01:12:47 EQUITIES ARE DOWNHEARTED YOU GET THAT ACCEPTANCE SPEECH, HE

01:12:50 MUTTERS THE WORD INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING AND ALL OF A SUDDEN

01:12:54 THINGS PICK UP. FOCUS ON THE POLICY OR IS THE

01:12:57 POLICY NO LONGER GOOD FOR MARKETS?

01:13:01 >> IN SOME WAYS I THINK THERE'S LESS UNCERTAINTY BECAUSE WE

01:13:05 KNOW -- WE ARE FAMILIAR WITH WHAT PRESIDENT BIDEN MEANS AND

01:13:09 REPRESENTS. WE ARE FAMILIAR WITH WHAT

01:13:11 PRESIDENT TRUMP REPRESENTS. IN SOME WAYS IT WILL BE A CLOSE

01:13:17 ELECTION SO WE COULD HAVE THAT MARKET UNCERTAINTY AS WE GO

01:13:21 INTO THE ELECTION BUT IN TERMS

01:13:27 OF POLICY LOCATIONS I DON'T THINK WE ARE EXPECTING

01:13:31 THIS TO BE THE BIG SHOT THAT IT WAS. LISA: I LOVE THIS.

01:13:39 BASICALLY SAYING STOP CALLING ME, CUT IT OUT.

01:13:43 >> WE DO LOVE OUR CLIENTS. JONATHAN:

01:13:47 THE TWO OF YOU, THANK YOU. FROM NEW YORK CITY THIS IS

01:13:49 BLOOMBERG.

01:14:06 JONATHAN: EQUITY FUTURES ON THE S&P RIGHT

01:14:11 NOW PULLING BACK A TOUCH, DOWN .1%. A LITTLE BIT SOFTER AFTER A

01:14:16 COUPLE OF DAYS OF GAINS. ALL-TIME HIGHS GOING INTO

01:14:19 PAYROLLS ONE HOUR AWAY.

01:14:26 2-YEAR, 4.4881. 10-YEAR, BREAKING 4% THIS WEEK.

01:14:34 LISA: WE HAVE SEEN UNDER NARRATIVE

01:14:36 SHIP THIS WEEK. WE HAVE GONE FROM THE LANDING,

01:14:42 INFLATION WILL NEVER GO AWAY, POTENTIALLY WE HAVE TO RAISE

01:14:45 RATES AGAIN TO WE ARE PROBABLY FINE, GOLDILOCKS.

01:14:48 THAT IS GIVING INTO BONDS. JONATHAN: FRAMING IS IMPORTANT.

01:14:55 200 K IS STILL REALLY DECENT FOR PAYROLLS AT A TIME WHEN

01:14:59 PEOPLE THINK WE ARE AROUND THE CORNER FROM A RECESSION. LISA:

01:15:03 I AM MOST INTERESTED IN THE REVISIONS.

01:15:10 IF353 WAS REAL, THAT WOULD HAVE A REAL EFFECT EVEN IF WE ARE IN

01:15:13 LINE WITH 200 K. JONATHAN: CERTAINLY FELT UNBELIEVABLE AT

01:15:17 THE TIME. LET'S SEE IF THE DATA BACKS IT

01:15:20 UP IN ABOUT 60 MINUTES TIME. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE ECB,

01:15:25 WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THE BOJ. DOLLAR-YEN DOWN TO147.

01:15:31 WE MAY GET A RATE HIKE FROM JAPAN THIS WEEK. LISA:

01:15:36 YOU CALLED THIS POLICY OPERATION STRETCH. -- OSTRICH.

01:15:46 WHEN I FIND AMAZING, IF THEY ARE ABLE TO KICK IT UP TO ZERO,

01:15:52 WHILE EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT RAISING RATES, THAT WOULD BE A

01:15:53 COUP.

01:15:59 TRYING TO NORMALIZE, KUDOS TO OPERATION OSTRICH. JONATHAN:

01:16:03 UNDER SURVEILLANCE THIS MORNING, PRESIDENT BIDEN'S

01:16:07 STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS STEERING THE NARRATIVE TOWARD

01:16:10 THE NOVEMBER ELECTION AND REMATCH AGAINST DONALD TRUMP.

01:16:16 THE SPEECH TOUCHING ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES INCLUDING

01:16:17 IMMIGRATION, HEALTH CARE, AND THE ECONOMY.

01:16:21 ALABAMA SANITARY KATIE BRITT GIVING THE REBUTTAL, DESCRIBING

01:16:24 BIDEN AS A DITHERING LEADER. NOT SURE THAT THAT LANDED AFTER

01:16:28 YESTERDAY'S PERFORMANCE. LISA: HE PUT TO BED A LOT OF CONCERNS

01:16:33 THAT HE WOULD COME OUT WITHOUT A LOT OF ENERGY.

01:16:36 THE ONLY CRITICISM IS MAYBE IT WAS TOO MUCH ENERGY BUT WHEN

01:16:41 YOU LOOK AT THE CRITICISMS, TO ME, IT IS LIKE PLAYGROUND

01:16:44 NAME-CALLING AT THIS POINT. IF HE IS GOING TO BE AS STRONG

01:16:50 AS HE WAS LAST NIGHT, IF THEY HAVE A DEBATE, WHEN DO WE START

01:16:53 TALKING ABOUT SUBSTANCE?

01:16:59 THE PLAYGROUND NAME-CALLING IS TOO MUCH. JONATHAN:

01:17:04 EIGHT MONTHS OUT TRYING TO WORK OUT POLICIES, WHAT IT MEANS FOR

01:17:05 MARKETS, AND IT IS TOO EARLY. LISA: LIBBY CRUSHED IT.

01:17:11 SAYING POLITELY, THERE IS NO TRADE HERE YET.

01:17:15 IT IS TOO EARLY TO KNOW ANY OF THESE THINGS.

01:17:20 THE ONLY THING THAT I COULD GLEAN WAS ABOUT CHINA.

01:17:24 REGARDLESS OF THE CANDIDATE, THAT IS SOMETHING TO

01:17:27 EXTRAPOLATE OUT. JONATHAN: IF YOU THOUGHT WHEN WE GET A

01:17:31 DEBATE BETWEEN THE TWO LEADERS, I WOULD SAY NO, BUT THAT

01:17:34 PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS BRINGING ON. LISA: I AM NOT BUYING IT.

01:17:39 WE CAN COME UP WITH A WAGER. THAT IS JUST MY GUT FEELING.

01:17:45 THERE WERE NOT REALLY DEBATES FOR THE PREDECESSOR WITH

01:17:48 RESPECT TO HIS OTHER CANDIDATES. IS THIS JUST GOING TO BE A

01:17:52 SCREAMING MATCH? I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD BE IN

01:17:55 IT FOR EITHER OF THEM. JONATHAN: JAY POWELL OFFERING INSIGHT

01:18:01 INTO THE FED IS THINKING, TELLING THE SENATE BANKING

01:18:05 COMMITTEE, THEY ARE NOT FAR FROM HAVING THE CONFIDENCE THAT

01:18:07 INFLATION IS MOVING SUSTAINABLY TOWARD 2%.

01:18:12 THE ECB KEEPING RATES ON HOLD, SUGGESTING A JUNE CUT COULD BE

01:18:13 ON THE CARDS. THE BANK OF FRANCE GOVERNOR

01:18:17 FLIRTING WITH APRIL. IF THESE FORECASTS AT THE ECB

01:18:24 BELONG TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE, WE WOULD BE HAVING A DIFFERENT

01:18:28 CONVERSATION ABOUT POLICY THAT WE ARE ABOUT ECB POLICY. LISA:

01:18:31 THE BIGGEST MYSTERY IS WHILE YOU ARE SEEING THE REACTION IN

01:18:33 THE EURO-DOLLAR. YOU ARE SEEING AN ECB WITH

01:18:40 EVERY REASON AND WILLINGNESS TO CUT MORE AGGRESSIVELY THAN THE

01:18:44 FEDERAL RESERVE, A SENSE THAT THERE IS GREATER WEAKNESS IN

01:18:46 THE ECONOMY THAN IN THE UNITED STATES.

01:18:50 AT THIS POINT, WHY WOULDN'T YOU BE TALKING ABOUT A

01:18:51 SIGNIFICANTLY STRONGER DOLLAR? JONATHAN:

01:18:55 THE EURO, A BIT STRONGER OFF OF THE BACK OF STRONG DATA.

01:19:01 HAVE NOT SEEN ANY BLOWOUT DATA ON THE ADP, ISM.

01:19:09 DUE OUT IN ONE HOUR FROM NOW, PAYROLLS EXPECTED TO RISE BY

01:19:10 200,000. BARCLAYS AT THE HIGH END

01:19:13 CALLING FOR 225. CITI AT THE LOW END CALLING FOR

01:19:17 145. ELLEN ZENTNER AT MORGAN STANLEY

01:19:22 WRITING ASSESSMENTS OF THE LABOR MARKET REMAINS STRONG,

01:19:26 DESPITE SOFTENING SLIGHTLY IN FEBRUARY.

01:19:29 ELLEN JOINS US AROUND THE TABLE. GREAT TO CATCH UP.

01:19:34 200,000 IS STILL PRETTY DECENT AGAINST A BACKDROP OF 353

01:19:37 BEFORE IT. ARE WE GOING TO SEE THAT

01:19:40 STRENGTH FOR A WHILE? ELLEN: I THINK SO.

01:19:47 THERE IS A QUESTION, AND, LISA, YOU TOUCHED ON THIS.

01:19:51 WHAT IF WE DON'T GET DOWNWARD BACK REVISIONS, ANOTHER BIG

01:19:52 NUMBER? THE DATA WE GOT IN JANUARY TOOK

01:19:57 A LONG TIME DOWNWARD TREND AND BLEW IT OUT OF THE WATER.

01:20:02 IT LOOKS LIKE THE TREND WAS NOT JUST INTERRUPTING, THERE WAS NO

01:20:03 DOWNWARD TREND.

01:20:10 THE BIG QUESTION MARK, AND WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSING ALL OF OUR

01:20:13 TIME AND ATTENTION ON THIS, IS IMMIGRATION.

01:20:16 IMMIGRATION HAS BEEN HUGE. IT HAS BOOSTED THE LABOR FORCE,

01:20:23 BOOSTED SUPPLY FOR LABOR, HAS BOOSTED JOB GAINS.

01:20:28 THAT MEANS THE BREAKEVEN LEVEL FOR JOBS HAS LIKELY BEEN MUCH

01:20:29 HIGHER THAN WHAT WE THOUGHT IT WAS.

01:20:36 NOT 353,000, BUT TWO HUNDRED 50,000 IS PROBABLY A NORMAL

01:20:37 PACE.

01:20:44 THAT IS REALLY WHAT WE'VE BEEN FOCUSED ON.

01:20:49 WHEN I TALKED TO POLICYMAKERS, THEY ARE FOCUSED ON THAT NOT IN

01:20:51 TERMS OF DO THESE POPULATION NUMBERS TELL US THAT WE WILL BE

01:20:56 ABLE TO HOLD POLICY FOR LONGER OR THAT WE WILL NOT BE CUTTING

01:20:59 RATES, IT REALLY TELLS THEM HOW THEY ARE LOOKING AT THE

01:21:00 INCOMING DATA. OVER THE MEDIUM TERM, THIS IS A

01:21:04 BIG POSITIVE FOR THE ECONOMY. THAT COMES WITH ITS OWN ISSUES

01:21:09 THOUGH BECAUSE AS A POLITICIAN IT IS DIFFICULT TO POINT TO

01:21:13 IMMIGRATION AS BEING SUCH A POSITIVE FOR THE ECONOMY,

01:21:16 BECAUSE IT IS ALSO A POLITICAL ISSUE. JONATHAN:

01:21:20 ARE YOU TALKING LEGAL OR ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION? ELLEN:

01:21:23 UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRATION. IT HAS MADE THAT MUCH OF A

01:21:25 DIFFERENCE. YOU ASKED ABOUT THE CBO NUMBERS.

01:21:36 ESTIMATES TOOK 800 TO 900,000 UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS LAST

01:21:39 YEAR AND RAISE THAT TO 3.1 MILLION, EXPECTS MORE OF THE

01:21:40 SAME THIS YEAR. IMMIGRATION POLICIES CAN CHANGE

01:21:48 AT ANY TIME, SO THOSE FLOWS CAN CHANGE, BUT RIGHT NOW IT IS

01:21:49 ADDING TO THE ECONOMY. FASTER LABOR FORCE GROWTH.

01:21:55 THE MISCONCEPTION IS THAT UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS CANNOT

01:21:56 WORK. THEY ARE GETTING SOMEWHAT COUNTED IN PAYROLLS, PROBABLY

01:22:04 UNDERCOUNTED IN HOUSEHOLD SURVEYS, WHICH EXPLAINS SOME OF

01:22:07 THE DIVERGENCE IN THOSE SURVEYS, BUT IT'S A TOPIC WE

01:22:08 ARE DIGGING INTO. LISA: HOW MUCH IS THE INCREASE IN THE

01:22:15 IMMIGRATION, LEGAL AND NOT, AND REASON WHY SOME OF THE SOFT

01:22:18 LANDING IS HAPPENING, WHERE YOU HAVE WAGE GROWTH COMING IN EVEN

01:22:22 THOUGH YOU HAVE SUCH ROBUST LABOR MARKET GAINS. ELLEN:

01:22:27 THIS IS ALL OVER THAT DATA, THIS IS THAT NARRATIVE.

01:22:32 HOW, IN 2023, DID WE HAVE SUCH FAST GROWTH IN THE ECONOMY,

01:22:36 BETTER THAN 3% WHILE INFLATION DECELERATED, WAGE GROWTH

01:22:38 DECELERATED? BECAUSE OF MUCH MORE LABOR

01:22:40 SUPPLY. AND SUPPLY CHAINS NORMALIZED.

01:22:50 2023 WAS A HUGE STORY ABOUT SUPPLY-SIDE NORMALIZATION.

01:22:54 THE QUESTION IS DID WE ABSORB THESE BIG FLOWS AND THIS YEAR

01:22:56 IS THE YEAR OF PAYBACK?

01:23:02 THIS WAS SOMETHING REFLECTED IN THE FOMC MINUTES, OR DOES THAT

01:23:06 EXTEND INTO THIS YEAR AND WE ARE JUST GOING THROUGH

01:23:10 SUPPLY-SIDE NORMALIZATION, SUPPLY-SIDE BOOST TO THE

01:23:11 ECONOMY? SO MORE OF THE SAME, STRONGER

01:23:16 GROWTH, SLOWER INFLATION. LISA:

01:23:22 JUST TO EXTRAPOLATE OUT, IF YOU STRIPPED THAT OUT, WHAT IS LEFT?

01:23:28 THAT IS A KEY QUESTION IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT WHETHER OR NOT

01:23:30 WE CAN PUSH FORWARD WITH THE TRENDS THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN

01:23:31 PERPETUITY. DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE

01:23:37 PRODUCTIVITY BOOM THAT EVERYONE HAS SEEN ON THE HEELS OF AI MAY

01:23:40 NOT OCCUR IN THE WAY THAT SOME ARE EXPECTING? ELLEN:

01:23:43 PRODUCTIVITY IS BEING IMPACTED BY A FEW THINGS.

01:23:48 SOME OF THE ASSUMPTIONS, COULD AI ALREADY BE IN THOSE NUMBERS?

01:23:53 I THINK IT IS SOON FOR THAT. WE ARE VERY POSITIVE ON AI'S

01:23:58 IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY LONG-TERM. I THINK IT WILL BE A MUCH

01:24:02 FASTER DIFFUSION ACROSS BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT

01:24:04 HISTORICALLY NORMAL. NORMALLY TAKES ABOUT 10 YEARS

01:24:09 FOR TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES TO DIFFUSE.

01:24:11 THIS IS PROBABLY A FEW YEARS. THIS DOESN'T EXPLAIN ALL OF

01:24:17 2023'S INCREASE IN PRODUCTIVITY AND I THINK IT GOES BACK TO THE

01:24:18 POPULATION GROWTH. THESE ARE LEGITIMATE NUMBERS.

01:24:24 IMMIGRATION IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO AN ECONOMY.

01:24:27 THAT IS WHY IMMIGRATION POLICY IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.

01:24:30 WE CANNOT SET THAT ASIDE. DO YOU SAY THAT THIS IS A

01:24:34 PRODUCTIVITY BOOM AND NOT A BLIP?

01:24:37 I DON'T KNOW THAT WE CAN ANSWER THAT YET.

01:24:41 WHAT I WANT TO SEE IS THAT YOU HAVE GOT THESE STRONG JOB GAINS

01:24:45 WHILE THE WORKFORCE, THE WORK WEEK IS HOLDING OUT.

01:24:50 RIGHT NOW EVEN SHRINKING THE WORK WEEK AND GETTING EVERYONE

01:24:51 EMPLOYED.

01:24:57 IN JANUARY, THOSE 350,000 JOBS WE CREATED, NO LABOR INPUT IN

01:25:00 JANUARY BECAUSE HOURS WORKED SHRINK.

01:25:03 WE WANT TO KEEP THOSE STEADY. JONATHAN:

01:25:06 FEDERAL RESERVE, NEUTRAL RIGHTS. CHAIRMAN POWELL TALKING ABOUT

01:25:10 BEING SUPER RESTRICTIVE. SUPER IS MY WORD.

01:25:16 SOMETHING SIMILAR FROM JOHN WILLIAMS, NEW YORK FED

01:25:19 PRESIDENT, THE NEUTRAL RATE STILL SEEMS QUITE LOW.

01:25:22 WHAT IS YOUR READ ON THAT? ELLEN: NO ONE KNOWS.

01:25:26 POLICYMAKERS ARE PEOPLE. THEY ARE FEELING THEIR WAY WITH

01:25:29 THEIR TOES IN THE SAND. THERE IS DISAGREEMENT ON JUST

01:25:32 HOW RESTRICTIVE THEY ARE. THEY WILL GET MORE RESTRICTIVE

01:25:36 OVER TIME AS INFLATION FALLS. REAL RATES CONTINUE TO RISE

01:25:40 EVEN THOUGH THE FED IS DOING NOTHING. BUT TO SAY THEY ARE

01:25:45 SIGNIFICANTLY RESTRICTIVE, THEY ARE WORKING THEIR WAY THROUGH

01:25:49 THE ECONOMY, HIGHER RATES, BUT IT'S BEEN TAKING A LOT LONGER

01:25:50 THAN WE THOUGHT. BUT THIS IS ABOUT THE RIGHT

01:25:55 PLACE FOR THEM TO PAUSE. RATES ARE HIGH.

01:25:59 WE CAN ARGUE HOW RESTRICTIVE THEY ARE.

01:26:01 YOU REALLY ONLY KNOW WHEN THE DATA IS COMING IN, AND THAT IS

01:26:06 WHY CHAIR POWELL IS PREPARED TO BEEN AN BILL AND REACT AROUND

01:26:07 THE DATA AS IT COMES IN. JONATHAN: NEEL KASHKARI POSE AN

01:26:11 INTERESTING QUESTION. WANT TO ASK OF YOU.

01:26:17 IF WE HAVE A RUN RIGHT THAT IS ATTRACTIVE, INFLATION COMING

01:26:19 DOWN, WHY DO ANYTHING? ELLEN: EXACTLY.

01:26:25 HE IS ON THE BOARD FOR FEWER RATE CUTS THAN THE MEDIAN.

01:26:31 WE DON'T EXPECT A CHANGE AT THE MARCH MEETING.

01:26:35 WE THINK YOU TRIMMED THE EXTREMES BASED ON FED SPEAK,

01:26:37 SINCE DECEMBER UPDATE. THE MEDIAN STAYS AT THREE CUTS.

01:26:42 YOU DON'T NEED TO DELIVER THEM NOW.

01:26:50 YOU CAN DELIVER THEM OCTOBER, NOVEMBER, SEPTEMBER, DECEMBER.

01:26:53 JONATHAN: YOU CAN GO THAT CLOSE TO THE

01:26:56 ELECTION? ELLEN: I TRY TO PUT THE ELECTION ASIDE

01:26:59 AND JUST REACT TO THE ECONOMY. I HAVE MY FED GOGGLES ON, AND

01:27:03 THAT IS WHAT THEY WOULD SAY. I STILL HAVE THE VIEW THAT THEY

01:27:09 DO STILL FIRST CUT IN JUNE, BEING GRADUALLY.

01:27:13 LET'S CUT, PAUSE, WAIT AND SEE. THAT IS BOSTICK'S VIEW ALSO.

01:27:21 YOU PROMISED WE WOULD DO THIS CAREFULLY.

01:27:25 AND THEN WE THINK TOWARD LATER IN THE YEAR, AFTER THE

01:27:29 ELECTION, ALTHOUGH IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE

01:27:32 ELECTION, THEY ARE SPEEDING UP TO EVERY MEETING. JONATHAN:

01:27:35 YOU SOUND LIKE A FED OFFICIAL THERE.

01:27:39 ONE OF THE BEST. ELLEN ZENTNER OF MORGAN STANLEY ON-THE-JOB

01:27:40 REPORT COMING OUT LATER.

01:27:47 LET'S GET YOU UP TO SPEED ON STORIES ELSEWHERE THIS MORNING.

01:27:50 HERE IS YOUR BLOOMBERG REFUELER DANI BURGER. DANI:

01:27:55 CHINA IS IN THE PROCESS OF RAISING $27 BILLION AT THE

01:27:56 TRIED TO COUNTER U.S. TECHNOLOGY CURVES.

01:28:02 THE FUND IS AMASSING A POOL OF CAPITAL FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:28:03 AND STATE ENTERPRISES. IT WOULD BE CHINA'S LARGEST

01:28:10 CHIP FUND TODAY, USED TO COUNTER A U.S.

01:28:11 CAMPAIGN TO THWART THE RISE OF CHINESE CHIPS.

01:28:15 SHARES OF COSCO ARE DOWN IN THE PREMARKET 4.1%.

01:28:18 THE COMPANY RECORDED GROSS MARGIN THAT MISSED ESTIMATES.

01:28:21 IT ONLY NARROWLY MISSED ESTIMATES BUT ANALYSTS AT CITI

01:28:27 MAINTAIN THEIR NEUTRAL OUTLOOK ON THE STOCK AND SAID IT IS

01:28:29 HARD TO SEE CATALYSTS TO DRIVE IT HIGHER.

01:28:34 NETFLIX IS KEEPING THE PUSH INTO SPORTS, ANNOUNCING IT WILL

01:28:39 LIVESTREAM A BOXING MATCH BETWEEN MIKE TYSON AND JAKE

01:28:43 PAUL. IT WILL BE THE STREAMING

01:28:45 PLATFORM'S THIRD LIVE EVENT FOLLOWING GOLF AND TENNIS

01:28:49 EXHIBITIONS. JONATHAN: UP NEXT ON THE PROGRAM, BITING

01:28:52 RAMPING UP AID TO GAZA. PRESIDENT BIDEN:

01:28:57 I AM LEAVING THE U.S. TO ESTABLISH A TEMPORARY PERIOD

01:29:00 IN THE MEDITERRANEAN ON THE COAST OF GAZA THAT CAN RECEIVE

01:29:05 LARGE SHIPMENTS HEARING FOOD, WATER, MEDICINE, TEMPORARY

01:29:07 SHELTER. JONATHAN: THAT CONVERSATION COMING UP

01:29:10 NEXT ON THIS PAYROLLS FRIDAY. S&P, -.2%.

01:29:32 JONATHAN: I'M NOT SURE HOW HE IS DOING

01:29:36 THIS BUT NEW YORK FED PRESIDENT JOHN WILLIAMS APPEARS TO BE

01:29:40 SIMULTANEOUSLY INVOLVED IN A POLICY CONVERSATION AND

01:29:41 LISTENING TO THE PROGRAM. WE DON'T TALK ABOUT POLITICS AT

01:29:47 FED POLICY MEETINGS, ACCORDING TO THE NEW YORK PRESIDENT. LISA:

01:29:51 BASICALLY SAYING, TRUE, THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING. JONATHAN:

01:29:55 I DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT FED SPEAK BEFORE PAYROLLS.

01:29:58 I WANTED AFTER THE JOBS NUMBER. LISA:

01:30:02 THEY CAN WAIT FOR THE DATA TO ROLL IN. JONATHAN:

01:30:06 EQUITY FUTURES NEGATIVE BY 0.16% ON THE S&P.

01:30:11 YIELDS LOWER BICYCLE BASIS POINT.

01:30:13 PAYROLLS COMING UP A LITTLE BIT LATER. 200,000 IS THE ESTIMATE.

01:30:20 PREVIOUS NUMBER, 353,000. UNDER SURVEILLANCE THIS

01:30:24 MORNING, THE PRESIDENT RAMPING UP AID TO GAZA.

01:30:30 PRESIDENT BIDEN TO ESTABLISH A TEMPORARY PIER ON THE

01:30:32 MEDITERRANEAN ON THE COAST OF GAZA THAT CAN RECEIVE LARGE

01:30:36 SHIPMENTS HEARING FOOD, WATER, MEDICINE, TEMPORARY SHELTER.

01:30:42 NO U.S. GOODS WILL BE ON THE GROUND.

01:30:47 WE CAN MASSIVELY INCREASE THE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE GOING

01:30:51 INTO GAZA EVERY DAY. JONATHAN: PRESIDENT BIDEN ORDERING THE

01:30:55 MILITARY TO BUILD A TEMPORARY PORT TO EASE THE HUMANITARIAN

01:30:59 CRISIS FROM THE ISRAEL--HAMAS WAR. BIDEN SAYS HE IS WORKING

01:31:04 NONSTOP FOR A SIX-WEEK CEASE FIRE AND THE RELEASE OF

01:31:08 HOSTAGES. ANNMARIE HORDERN IS IN D.C.

01:31:11 A SERIOUS ISSUE TO UNITE HIS PARTY.

01:31:15 ANNMARIE : ABSOLUTELY A SERIOUS ISSUE

01:31:18 WHEN IT COMES TO FOREIGN POLICY. HE SAID HE WAS HOPEFUL OF A

01:31:24 CEASE-FIRE THAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED THIS PAST MONDAY.

01:31:26 WE DIDN'T SEE ONE. AT THE SAME TIME, HE IS FACING

01:31:30 AN UPHILL BATTLE WITH MEMBERS OF HIS OWN PARTY.

01:31:36 RECENTLY IN MICHIGAN, 100,000 VOTERS IN HIS OWN PARTY VOTED

01:31:41 ON COMMITTEE -- UNCOMMITTED OVER HIS HANDLING OF THE

01:31:43 ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR. JOINING ME NOW IS DEBBIE

01:31:48 DINGELL, REPRESENTING SOME OF THOSE VOTERS WHO VOTED

01:31:49 UNCOMMITTED. THIS IS A DIFFICULT ISSUE FOR

01:31:52 THE PRESIDENT. HE ADDRESSED IT 60 MINUTES IN.

01:32:02 AND HIS WAY TO THE CAPITOL, HE WOULD HAVE BEEN WITNESSING

01:32:04 ROADS BLOCKED BECAUSE OF PROTESTERS IN THE STREETS

01:32:05 DEMANDING A CEASE-FIRE NOW. DID HE DO ENOUGH LAST NIGHT TO

01:32:10 ASSUAGE CONCERNS OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS? DEBBIE:

01:32:13 GOOD MORNING. GREAT TO BE WITH YOU.

01:32:16 THIS IS WHAT I WOULD SAY. I THINK HE TALKED ABOUT THE

01:32:21 ISSUE WITH THE ABILITY THAT HE HAD TO TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE,

01:32:23 WHAT HE COULD SAY PUBLICLY. I WAS DISAPPOINTED.

01:32:29 I AM SOMEONE WHO THINGS THAT WE NEED A CEASE-FIRE.

01:32:31 WE HAVE SEEN FAR TOO MANY PEOPLE DIED.

01:32:38 MORE THAN 30,000 INNOCENT CIVILIANS, 12,000 TO 14,000 OF

01:32:41 THEM ARE CHILDREN, AND THEY ARE STARVING TO DEATH.

01:32:45 THE SITUATION ON THE GROUND IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST CRISIS

01:32:50 ISSUES I'VE EVER SEEN. THE PRESIDENT, SECRETARY OF

01:32:53 STATE, MANY OTHER SENIOR OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO

01:32:56 NEGOTIATE A TEMPORARY CEASE-FIRE, NEGOTIATE GETTING

01:32:57 MORE HUMANITARIAN AID IN. I AM NOT IN THOSE ROOMS. I HEAR

01:33:02 LOTS OF RUMBLINGS. SO WE DIDN'T GET ANY

01:33:06 ANNOUNCEMENT OF CEASE-FIRE. I KNOW THEY WILL CONTINUE TO

01:33:11 PRESS FOR IT, I HOPE IT HAPPENS SOON, SO I WAS DISAPPOINTED BY

01:33:17 THAT. BUT WE HAVE TO GET AID IN THERE.

01:33:20 AND ISRAEL IS CONTRIBUTE INTO THE DIFFICULTY OF GETTING AID

01:33:24 IN. IT IS ONE OF THE MOST SEVERE HUMANITARIAN CRISIES WE HAVE

01:33:28 SEEN. CHILDREN ARE STARVING TO DEATH.

01:33:35 ISRAEL CANNOT TELL US WHAT WE CAN OR CANNOT DO, WHICH WE

01:33:41 SHOULD NOT ALLOW THEM TO DO ANYWAY.

01:33:44 WHAT HAMAS DID WAS A TERRORIST ATTACK AND I WANT THOSE

01:33:46 HOSTAGES TO COME HOME DESPERATELY BUT I ALSO DON'T

01:33:48 WANT TO SEE ANYONE ELSE DIE IN GAZA.

01:33:51 WE HAVE SEEN ENOUGH INNOCENT DEATHS. ANNMARIE:

01:33:55 SOUNDS LIKE YOU WERE SLIGHTLY DISAPPOINTED WHEN IT COMES TO

01:33:56 HIS DELIVERY ON GAZA. DEBBIE: I WOULDN'T SAY DISAPPOINTED.

01:34:02 ANNMARIE: I WANT TO GET TO ONE POINT.

01:34:05 YOU WERE VOCAL AHEAD OF THE 2016 ELECTION THAT HILLARY

01:34:10 CLINTON COULD LOSE TO PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP, AND YOU ARE

01:34:14 CORRECT TO BE VOCAL, WARNING YOUR DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES.

01:34:18 CAN BIDEN WIN WITHOUT THE BLUE WALL? DEBBIE:

01:34:22 MICHIGAN IS CRITICAL. THERE IS NO ROAD TO THE WHITE

01:34:25 HOUSE WITHOUT MICHIGAN. I HAVE SAID IT BEFORE AND I

01:34:29 WILL SAY IT AGAIN, WE ARE A PURPLE STATE, AND WILL BE UNTIL

01:34:32 ELECTION DAY. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 2016 AND

01:34:37 NOW, NOBODY BELIEVED ME. THEY THOUGHT I WAS CRAZY.

01:34:42 I WAS IN THOSE UNION HALLS. I KNEW WHAT THEY WERE SAYING.

01:34:49 NOW WE HAVE TO TURN OUT WOMEN, AND I KNOW WHAT THE WOMEN ARE

01:34:52 SAYING, AND THEY ARE NOT HAPPY ABOUT ROE HAVING BEEN

01:34:57 OVERTURNED, NOW FURTHER TALK ABOUT LEGISLATION THAT WILL PUT

01:34:58 THE GOVERNMENT IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL HEALTH DECISIONS,

01:35:00 THEY DON'T LIKE THAT. THAT IS A GROUP THAT WE HAVE TO

01:35:02 TURN OUT. TURN OUT THE UNION VOTES.

01:35:07 WE HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT NEED TO BE ENERGIZED LIKE THEY WERE

01:35:09 TWO YEARS AGO. PEOPLE BELIEVE ME THIS TIME.

01:35:14 WE ARE WORKING TOGETHER. WE WILL ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AND

01:35:17 GET THE WORK DONE. ANNMARIE: I'M GLAD YOU MENTIONED UNION

01:35:21 HALLS. TODAY IS JOBS DAY.

01:35:25 RECENTLY, AUTOWORKERS SUFFERED JOB CUTS AT FACTORIES IN

01:35:30 MICHIGAN. WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT IT TAKES

01:35:35 TO BUILD A GAS POWERED CAR, IT IS THOUSANDS OF SUPPLIES.

01:35:38 A LOT LESS WHEN IT COMES TO EV'S. DO YOU THINK THIS ELECTRIC

01:35:45 OCCASION TO EV'S WILL ACTUALLY HURT UNION JOBS? DEBBIE:

01:35:52 I DON'T THINK IT WILL HURT UNION JOBS THAT WE HAVE TO DO

01:35:55 THIS TRANSITION IN A WAY THAT WE ENSURE THAT THERE WILL BE

01:36:00 NEW JOBS, DIFFERENT KINDS OF JOBS. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THE

01:36:04 INFRASTRUCTURE IS BUILT OUT THAT PEOPLE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN

01:36:06 THESE EV'S. I COULD GO INTO THESE PLANS AND

01:36:12 THERE ARE DIFFERENT REASONS RIGHT NOW, THERE HAVE BEEN

01:36:18 LAYOFFS FOR A WHILE, BUT VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE ALL WORK

01:36:21 TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THE GROUNDWORK AND INFRASTRUCTURE

01:36:25 IS IN PLACE TO MAKE EV'S SUCCESSFUL AND THAT WE ARE

01:36:27 TRAINING PEOPLE FOR THE NEW JOBS OF THE FUTURE WHICH IS

01:36:33 PART OF SETTING UP THE INFRASTRUCTURE. ANNMARIE:

01:36:35 WHEN IT COMES TO THE EV INDUSTRY, ELON MUSK IS

01:36:38 SYNONYMOUS WITH IT. HE RECENTLY MET WITH FORMER

01:36:41 PRESIDENT TRUMP. LOOKING BACK, DO YOU THINK IT

01:36:46 WAS A MISTAKE FOR THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION TO SNUB TESLA

01:36:50 WHEN THEY HAD THAT MASSIVE ROLLOUT IN THE SUMMER OF 2021?

01:36:56 DEBBIE: TESLA IS NOT A UNION COMPANY.

01:36:59 I HAVE SPOKEN TO MANY OF THE WORKERS THERE.

01:37:01 THERE ARE MANY COMPLAINTS.

01:37:07 I WANT TO SEE OUR AMERICAN AUTO COMPANIES -- TESLA IS BASED

01:37:09 HERE IN THE U.S. -- AND I WANT TO SEE THEM BE

01:37:10 SUCCESSFUL. AND WE HAVE SEEN SOME CHANGES.

01:37:18 IN THE LAST YEAR, BUILDING OUT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE FOR

01:37:20 CHARGING EV'S IS VERY IMPORTANT. TESLA HAS REACHED OUT TO THE

01:37:26 DOMESTIC COMPANIES, REACHING OUT SO THAT THEY CAN USE THEIR

01:37:29 TESTING -- CHARGING SYSTEM. WE WILL SEE WHERE THIS GOES.

01:37:36 IF TESLA PLAYS NICE OR IF THEY CONTINUE ON THEIR PAST

01:37:41 BEHAVIOR, WHICH HAS MADE SOME PEOPLE -- I DON'T NEED TO GO

01:37:45 MORE THAN THAT, PEOPLE KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

01:37:48 ANNMARIE: THANK YOU SO MUCH TIME FOR YOUR

01:37:51 -- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME THIS MORNING.

01:37:55 MICHIGAN IS A KEY STATE. WE SAW WITH THOSE UNCOMMITTED

01:38:01 BUT ALSO RANK-AND-FILE UNION MEMBERS. JONATHAN:

01:38:04 GREAT WORK DOWN IN WASHINGTON. PAYROLLS FRIDAY.

01:38:09 JOB NUMBER JUST AROUND THE CORNER, 34 MINUTES AWAY.

01:38:14 THE ESTIMATE, 200,000. UNBELIEVABLE TO SEE A THREE

01:38:18 HANDLE ON ON APPOINTMENT. 3.7% IS THE ESTIMATE THIS

01:38:21 MORNING. LISA: A LOT OF FOCUS ON HOW MANY

01:38:28 HOURS WERE WORKED EACH WEEK, BECAUSE THAT IS KEY ON HOW

01:38:29 COMPANIES ARE USING THEIR LABOR. JONATHAN:

01:38:32 STACKED LINEUP IN THE NEXT HOUR. NADIA LOVELL, BETSY DUKE,

01:38:39 MICHELLE MAYER OF MASTERCARD, AND MOHAMED EL-ERIAN.

01:38:42 FROM NEW YORK CITY, THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

01:39:02 >> WHAT WE EXPECT TO GET FROM THE PAYROLLS IS A SEQUENTIAL:

01:39:05 FROM THE HOT THAT WE SAW LAST MONTH, BUT STILL ROBUST. >> THE

01:39:09 LABOR MARKET PROBABLY HELD UP JUST FINE.

01:39:13 A TOUCH STRONGER WITH CONSENSUS AT 215,000.

01:39:18 >> WE THINK IT COULD EASILY BE 250,000.

01:39:22 >> POTENTIAL FOR THE ECONOMY TO GROW FASTER THAN EXPECTED

01:39:27 BECAUSE OF PRODUCTIVITY.

01:39:28 >> ANOTHER STRONG REPORT IN FEBRUARY.

01:39:30 HISTORY COULD REPEAT AGAIN.

01:39:35 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE WITH JONATHAN

01:39:37 FERRO, LISA ABRAMOVITZ, AND ANNMARIE HORDERN. JONATHAN:

01:39:41 JUST 30 MINUTES AND THEN WE CAN ALL GO HOME. LISA:

01:39:46 WE HAVE ANOTHER HALF HOUR AFTER THAT AND IT WILL BE

01:39:51 SCINTILLATING CONVERSATION. JONATHAN:

01:39:52 FROM NEW YORK CITY THIS MORNING, LET'S GET YOU TO THE

01:39:53 WEEKEND. GOOD MORNING FOR OUR AUDIENCE

01:39:58 WORLDWIDE. PAYROLL, 20 MINUTES AWAY.

01:40:04 THE NUMBER WE ARE LOOKING FOR, 200,000.

01:40:07 PREVIOUS NUMBER, 353,000. WILL THAT LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN

01:40:10 FOR THE FED TO INCREASE INTEREST RATES? LISA:

01:40:16 ELLEN ZENTNER SAID IT REALLY ONLY, DO WE KNOW WHY WE HAVE

01:40:18 SUCH A STRONG JOB CREATION WITHOUT IMMIGRATION?

01:40:23 IT REALLY POINTS OUT, COULD YOU GET RATE CUTS EVEN IF YOU HAVE

01:40:28 REALLY BIG HEADLINE NUMBERS SIBLEY BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER

01:40:31 FACTORS AT PLAY HERE THAT WILL ALLOW DISINFLATION TO CONTINUE?

01:40:33 JONATHAN: IN SHORT, YES. MOHAMED EL-ERIAN WILL JOIN US

01:40:38 IN 30 MINUTES TIME. HE WROTE A PIECE IN THE LAST

01:40:43 MONTH ABOUT THIS FEDERAL RESERVE BEING HELD HOSTAGE BY

01:40:44 THE ECONOMIC DATA. WHAT IS INTERESTING ABOUT THAT

01:40:51 COMMENT, I HAVE NOT HEARD CHAIRMAN POWELL BE DERAILED AT

01:40:53 ALL BY THE DATA IN THE LAST MONTH.

01:40:55 THE MESSAGE HAS HARDLY CHANGED. MAYBE MOHAMMED WILL BE HAPPY

01:40:58 WITH THAT. LISA: THE DATA COMING IN BELOW

01:41:04 EXPECTATIONS THAT WERE BUILT IN. EVEN ON A DATA LEVEL, SURPRISES

01:41:11 TO THE UPSIDE, WE HAVE GOTTEN SOME WITH INFLATION, BUT IT IS

01:41:17 MOSTLY IN THE STRENGTH OF THE ECONOMY, WHICH IS WHY YOU ARE

01:41:20 GETTING THIS GOLDILOCKS RALLY INTO EVERYTHING, BONDS AND

01:41:21 STOCKS. JONATHAN: EARLIER THIS WEEK, IT STARTED

01:41:26 WITH THE ISM SERVICES EMPLOYMENT COMPONENT.

01:41:28 NEGATIVE, NOT GREAT. ADP WAS A BIT SOFTER. ALL RIGHT.

01:41:38 JOBLESS CLAIMS AROUND 220,000 IN THAT RANGE IN THE LAST WEEK.

01:41:41 THE SURFACE, IT IS JUST ALL RIGHT.

01:41:44 TAKEAWAY EXPECTATIONS AND LOOK AT IT IN ABSOLUTE TERMS,

01:41:47 ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC. REALLY DECENT DATA AND

01:41:50 TREMENDOUS FOR A WHILE. LISA: THE ISSUE IS IT DOESN'T SEEM TO

01:41:54 BE ACCELERATING. IT SEEMS FINE AND DOESN'T SEEM

01:41:59 TO BE MOVING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION, WHICH IS WHY IT IS

01:42:02 TELLING THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE THINK THERE WILL BE A MARKET

01:42:05 NEGATIVE, RISK OFF FEEL FROM THIS DATA.

01:42:12 ONLY 16% OF SURVEY PARTICIPANTS ACTUALLY THOUGHT YOU WOULD HAVE

01:42:15 A RISK OFF TYPE OF MOVE AS A RESULT OF THE DATA.

01:42:18 WHAT COULD TRIGGER THAT OTHER THAN A BLOWOUT NUMBER BUT ALSO

01:42:22 SOME INFLATIONARY UMPH? IF YOU GET STRONG GROWTH, THAT

01:42:25 IS GOOD.

01:42:33 JONATHAN: WOULD YOU LIKE A SURVEY?

01:42:37 WHATEVER THAT WAS.

01:42:39 FROM THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENCE, SMALL BUSINESSES

01:42:43 FROM THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY. 35% SAID THEY RAISED

01:42:47 COMPENSATION. 12% INDICATED THEY EXPECT TO

01:42:50 HIRE IN THE NEXT THREE MONTHS, THE LOWEST SINCE THE ONSET OF

01:42:57 THE PANDEMIC. WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE HEADLINE

01:43:00 NUMBER BUT WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH

01:43:03 SMALL BUSINESS. HIGH RATES ARE NOT HURTING SOME

01:43:06 PEOPLE, THEY ARE HURTING OTHERS. SOME SMALL BUSINESSES ARE NOT

01:43:09 REALLY STRUGGLING. LISA:

01:43:16 WHICH IS WHY, EVEN IN THE BEIGE BOOK, THERE WAS A DISCREPANCY.

01:43:20 REGIONS WHERE WE SAW WEAKNESS, A NEGATIVE VIEW.

01:43:23 IT HAS BEEN A CONFUSED MOMENT. THE RUSSELL 2000 HAVE

01:43:26 UNDERPERFORMED BECAUSE OF THIS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE QUITS

01:43:31 RATE, HOW MANY FEEL THE FREEDOM TO QUIT THEIR JOBS?

01:43:33 THAT HAS FALLEN DRAMATICALLY. THERE IS A LESS OPTIMISTIC

01:43:40 VIEW, LESS ROSY THAN IT USED TO BE. JONATHAN:

01:43:44 I WON'T ASK YOU HOW MUCH FREEDOM YOU FEEL PERSONALLY.

01:43:49 EQUITY FUTURES ON THE S&P, NEGATIVE BY 0.1%.

01:43:53 YIELDS ARE LOWER BY A SINGLE BASIS POINT.

01:43:57 4.07 ON THE 10-YEAR.

01:44:04 COMING UP THIS HOUR, NADIA LOVELL OF UBS ON WHY SHE THINKS

01:44:08 A SUSTAINABLE MARKET IS LIKELY. BETSY DUKE WEIGHING IN ON

01:44:11 CONGRESSIONAL TESTIMONY. AND MICHELLE MAYER REACTING TO

01:44:15 PAYROLLS DATA. STOCKS HITTING ALL-TIME HIGHS

01:44:20 AHEAD OF THE PAYROLLS REPORT. THE MEDIAN ESTIMATE CALLING FOR

01:44:27 PAYROLLS TO RISE BY 200,000 IN FEBRUARY, A SLOWDOWN FROM THE

01:44:29 UPSIDE SURPRISE LAST MONTH. NADIA LOVELL SAYING THE

01:44:34 EVIDENCE CONTINUES TO BUILD FOR SOLID ECONOMIC GROWTH THAT'S

01:44:38 DRIVING EARNINGS RECOVERY, HELPING TO OFFSET HEADWINDS OF

01:44:42 HIRE FOR LONGER INTEREST RATES. WE REMAIN INSTRUCTIVE ON THE

01:44:44 MARKET AND EXPECT THE S&P 500 YOU CONTINUE TO NOTCH NEW HIGHS

01:44:47 THIS YEAR. NADIA, GREAT TO SEE YOU IN

01:44:49 PERSON. IS LISA RIGHT?

01:44:57 NADIA: IT IS A COMBINATION. THE ECONOMY REMAINS ON SOLID

01:45:00 FOOTING. YOU SEE A MARKET THAT CONTINUES

01:45:03 TO GRIND HIGHER. WE HAVE HAD A 16 NEW HIGHS THIS

01:45:07 YEAR DESPITE THE BACKUP IN RATES.

01:45:11 IT FEELS LIKE THE MARKET IS ALREADY PREPARING FOR THE

01:45:13 POSSIBILITY OF RATES BEING HIGHER FOR LONGER EARNINGS

01:45:16 GROWTH IS REALLY SUPPORTING THIS MARKET.

01:45:19 I THINK WE ARE IN A STATE WHERE GOOD NEWS IS GOOD NEWS, BAD

01:45:25 NEWS IS STILL PROBABLY GOOD NEWS BECAUSE IT ACCELERATES THE

01:45:26 RATE BECAUSE THAT WE GET FROM THE FED. LISA:

01:45:30 BACK TO WHAT HOWARD MARK SAID, NOT A LOT TO DO. WHAT DO YOU DO?

01:45:37 DO YOU STAY INVESTED AND KEEP A LISTING -- COLLECTING THAT TWO

01:45:38 PERCENT GAIN EVERY WEEK? NADIA: THERE IS SO MUCH TO DO.

01:45:43 WHEN WE LOOK ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE OF INVESTMENT

01:45:46 OPPORTUNITIES, YES, THERE IS STUFF TO DO IN TECH, BUT THERE

01:45:51 IS ALSO HEALTH CARE AND INDUSTRIALS, EVEN SMALL CAP.

01:45:56 WE WERE TALKING EARLIER ABOUT THE BEIGE BOOK STRENGTH AND

01:46:01 WEAKNESSES, BUT IN REALITY, YOU HAVE TWO THIRDS OF DISTRICTS

01:46:02 ACTUALLY POINTING TO A PICKUP IN ACTIVITY.

01:46:07 ISM, IT FEELS LIKE THE BOTTOM IS BEHIND US.

01:46:09 WE WILL GET EXPANSION IN MANUFACTURING IN THE NEXT

01:46:11 COUPLE MONTHS. THAT SHOULD BE POSITIVE FOR

01:46:13 SMALL CAPS. I THINK THERE ARE LOTS OF

01:46:17 OPPORTUNITIES HERE DESPITE THE MARKET GOING HIGHER. LISA:

01:46:21 HOW DO YOU TRACK WHERE THE MONEY IS COMING FROM, HOW

01:46:25 DURABLE IT IS INTO MANUFACTURING SECTORS, WHEN

01:46:29 PEOPLE ARE POINTING TO FISCAL SUPPORT DROPPING THE STRENGTH

01:46:30 THAT WE SEE NOW? NADIA: CORPORATE BALANCE SHEETS ARE

01:46:35 STRONG, HAVE A LOT OF CASH ON THEIR BALANCE SHEETS, AS WELL

01:46:38 AS THE CONSUMER REMAINS STRONG. WE HAVE MIXED SENTIMENT BUT

01:46:43 THEY ARE STILL SPENDING.

01:46:46 THAT IS WHAT WILL SUPPORT THIS MARKET ALSO THESE SMALLER

01:46:51 COMPANIES. CAPITAL MARKETS ARE OPEN.

01:46:54 JONATHAN: WIDE-OPEN. NADIA: LOOK AT THE BOND MARKET.

01:47:01 EVEN THE EQUITY MARKET FROM A SECONDARY STANDPOINT, MASSIVE

01:47:06 PICKUP IN SECONDARY, PARTICULARLY FROM THESE SMALL

01:47:07 COMPANIES THAT CAN ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKET. JONATHAN:

01:47:10 LET'S DRAW DOWN ON YOUR SECTOR PREFERENCES.

01:47:12 I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TECH. I KNOW YOU CANNOT SPEAK TO

01:47:16 SINGLE NAMES, BUT THE BREAKDOWN OF THE MAG SEVEN IS SOMETHING

01:47:20 THAT WE ARE FOLLOWING. HOW MAGNIFICENT IS THE

01:47:25 SO-CALLED MAGNIFICENT SEVEN AT THE MOMENT? NADIA:

01:47:28 NOT SO MAGNIFICENT. ONE OF THEM IS NOT EVEN PART OF

01:47:33 THE SEVEN LARGEST STOCKS IN THE U.S. ANYMORE.

01:47:37 BUT AT -- THAT IS A GOOD THING. YOU ARE SEEING BIFURCATION

01:47:43 AMONG THESE STOCKS IN FAVOR OF SOME OF THE OTHER CYCLICAL

01:47:46 AREAS OF THE MARKET. I DON'T THINK THAT YOU NEED THE

01:47:50 MAGNIFICENT SEVEN TO ALL GO UP FOR THIS MARKET TO RALLY.

01:47:55 LOOK AT INDUSTRIALS, FINANCIALS, A PICKUP THERE AS

01:47:58 WELL. ALSO IT IS HEALTHY FOR THIS

01:48:01 BULL MARKET TO HAVE THAT RALLY BROADEN UP.

01:48:05 LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF STOCKS OUTPERFORMING THE INDEX YEAR TO

01:48:06 DATE, 40%. LAST YEAR WE WERE LUCKY TO SEE

01:48:10 20%. 30% OF STOCKS ARE WITHIN, OR

01:48:14 NEAR ALL-TIME HIGHS. JONATHAN: JP MORGAN, ALL-TIME HIGHS THIS

01:48:18 WEEK. WHAT IS UNDERPINNING THAT PICKUP FOR THE LARGEST BANKS?

01:48:24 NADIA: A LOT OF THE BANKS LAST YEAR

01:48:25 WERE PRICING IN RECESSION. ALSO EVEN THE NUMBER OF RATE

01:48:29 CUTS. EXPECTATIONS FOR A LOT MORE

01:48:32 RATE CUTS. A LOT HAVE COME OUT OF THE

01:48:37 MARKET AND YOU ARE SEEING THE ECONOMIC MOMENTUM STILL THERE.

01:48:43 THE ATLANTA FED GDP IS TRACKING AT 2.5%. THAT IS GOOD FOR BANKS.

01:48:46 CAPITAL MARKETS. THAT IS HOW BANKS MAKE THEIR

01:48:48 MONEY. THAT IS PICKING UP. THAT IS WHY YOU ARE SEEING THIS

01:48:53 RALLY IN THE BANKS. CONCERNS AROUND COMMERCIAL REAL

01:49:00 ESTATE SEEMS TO BE IDIOSYNCRATIC, MORE TOWARD THE

01:49:01 SMALLER BANKS. LARGER BANKS HAVE PROVISIONED

01:49:03 FOR THIS. JONATHAN: IS -- LISA: IS THERE ANYTHING YOU DON'T

01:49:08 LIKE? NADIA: IT IS NOT THE TIME TO BE TOO

01:49:12 DEFENSIVE. WE ARE UNDERWEIGHT UTILITIES

01:49:15 AND REAL ESTATE. WE THINK THERE ARE BETTER

01:49:20 OPPORTUNITIES IN THE OTHER CYCLICAL AREAS OF THE MARKET.

01:49:23 LISA: 20 MINUTES AWAY FROM THE PAYROLLS REPORT PROBABLY WILL

01:49:25 NOT MATTER. IT WILL BE RISK ON.

01:49:29 IS THERE A NUMBER, SOMETHING IN THE INTERNALS OF THAT REPORT

01:49:34 THAT COULD GIVE YOU PAUSE? NADIA: WE ARE ALL WATCHING WAGE

01:49:38 GROWTH. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WAGE

01:49:44 GROWTH TRACKER AT 5% -- IT FEELS LIKE WE ARE HAVING SOME

01:49:47 PRODUCTIVITY GAINS, UNIT LABOR COST HAS COME DOWN, BUT THE FED

01:49:51 IS SENSITIVE. THEY HAVE POINTED OUT NUMEROUS

01:49:55 TIMES THEY WANT TO SEE WAGE GROWTH CLOSER TO 3%.

01:49:58 IF YOU HAVE A HOT WAGE NUMBER, THAT IS SOMETHING THAT CAN GIVE

01:50:02 US PAUSE. JONATHAN: WONDERFUL TO SEE YOU, GREAT TO

01:50:05 DO THIS IN PERSON.

01:50:11 IT IS A HEADS I WIN, TAILS YOU LOSE JOBS NUMBER. LISA:

01:50:14 BUT NOBODY IS LOSING. JONATHAN: YOU, THE BEARS. LISA:

01:50:21 BRAMO, YOU. JONATHAN:

01:50:27 YOU ASK A BULL, IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU DON'T LIKE?

01:50:30 THEY WILL JUST NAME DEFENSIVE SECTORS. LISA:

01:50:33 PEOPLE ARE BULLISH RIGHT NOW. I KEEP GOING BACK TO THIS

01:50:39 RESEARCH PIECE WHICH SHOWS A TINY MINORITY OF PEOPLE THINK

01:50:41 THIS WILL BE A RISK OFF MOVE. JONATHAN: 18 MINUTES AWAY.

01:50:45 WE WILL SETTLE THE ARGUMENT IN JUST A MINUTE.

01:50:49 S&P NEGATIVE BY 0.1%. HERE IS DANI BURGER WITH YOUR

01:50:52 BLOOMBERG BRIEF. DANI: THE U.S.

01:51:03 AND UAE ARE LAUNCHING -- AND EU ARE LAUNCHING PLANS TO HAVE A

01:51:06 MARITIME CORRIDOR. A TEMPORARY U.S.

01:51:11 MILITARY PORT ON THE GAZA COAST WILL BE BUILT TO HELP DELIVER

01:51:12 AID. HE ALSO CALLED ON ISRAEL TO ALLOW MORE AID IN.

01:51:19 THE NEW YORK PRIVATE SECTOR WORKFORCE HIT A RECORD OF 8.3

01:51:21 MILLION JOBS IN JANUARY. GOVERNOR KATHY HOCHUL SAYS IT

01:51:26 MARKS A FULL RECOVERY FROM THE PANDEMIC.

01:51:36 THE BATTLE TO BAN TIKTOK IS HEATING UP.

01:51:40 HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER STEVE SCALISE SAID HE WOULD BRING A

01:51:43 BILL TO THE FLOOR NEXT
