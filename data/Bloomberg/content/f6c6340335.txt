President Joe Biden will take aim at his top Republican challengers, Donald Trump and Nikki Haley , with back-to-back events highlighting their vulnerabilities in a general election contest.

On Saturday, he plans to speak near Valley Forge in Pennsylvania, a Revolutionary War site, where he will mark the third anniversary of the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the US Capitol. He again will cast Trump, the Republican frontrunner, as a threat to US democracy.
