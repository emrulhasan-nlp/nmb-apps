00:05 The Everything rally is likely to continue for a little bit longer.

00:08 I think stocks and continue probably to do well, high quality stocks.

00:11 The winners themselves, when momentum is high, can continue to do well.

00:17 There's still very much a speculative fervor within the market.

00:20 We've been bullish. We remain bullish.

00:22 We still, you know, very much seem to be in this sweet spot.

00:24 This is Bloomberg Surveillance with Jonathan Ferro, Lisa Abramowitz and

00:29 Annmarie Horden Hearn. Let's get you to the weekend live from

00:34 New York City this morning. Good morning.

00:36 Good morning for our audience worldwide. This is Bloomberg Surveillance am back

00:40 in the hot seat. It's been a while.

00:41 She can tell us where she's been in just a moment.

00:43 Equity futures on the S&P 500 positive by 0.1%.

00:48 Four day winning streak on the S&P 520th all time high of 2024.

00:52 That date is pretty decent. Central banks are leaning into rate

00:56 cuts. What's not to like?

00:57 Which is the reason why everyone seems incredibly risk on which maybe should

01:00 make some people worried. But it doesn't because there's no reason

01:03 not to. You've got the fiscal impulse on one

01:04 side, you've got the monetary impulse on the other, and the both going in the

01:07 same direction, which is things going up.

01:10 The Fed speak a little bit later as well.

01:11 I think Chairman Powell opening a Fed Listens event.

01:14 We'll hear from Bostic. And Bob, what are you looking for?

01:16 I don't know the truth. I looked at this and he's going to come

01:19 out and say, I'm so glad I'm ready to hear.

01:20 And listen. I don't think he's going to try to say

01:22 anything. But the interesting thing is he's not

01:24 going to try to say anything. No one's talking about clean up.

01:26 I'll clean up on aisle two. Jay Powell, which to me is telling

01:30 because after December, people said, okay, well, who's going to come out and

01:33 say this was a bit premature? Now it's clear it's a dovish pivot that

01:37 was real back in December. Regardless of the data, we are listening

01:39 to the DOJ. Just yesterday, check out shares of

01:42 Apple down yesterday by about 4% this morning, higher by 0.2% in the

01:47 pre-market. The DOJ suing Apple for violating

01:49 antitrust rules. And we welcome back.

01:51 We need to get into that. What stood out for you in that report?

01:55 Well, there's a number of things they're alleging in terms of these antitrust.

01:58 It feels like what they say is that rivals are not able to access the

02:02 hardware or software that Apple keeps so closely guarded.

02:05 For me, though, it had to be they take issue with the fact that if you're an

02:09 iPhone user, new message, an Android user, it's the green bubble versus the

02:14 blue one. If you read the more than 80 pages of

02:16 this lawsuit, they actually say social stigma was part of it.

02:21 So there's a lot of individuals who are pushing back on this and saying, is this

02:24 going too far in terms of really calling on Apple for Monopoly?

02:28 What I found interesting was that previous antitrust suits didn't have a

02:31 market reaction. All of the sort of legal action in

02:33 Europe didn't seem to matter to Apple shares.

02:35 Suddenly this one matters a whole lot. Is it because of the substance of the

02:38 suit or because it's just convenient timing and people are souring on Apple

02:42 after a pretty substantial decline in the face of weakness?

02:45 Can I say both? Because the list is long.

02:47 China increasing competition. Exactly.

02:49 Take your pick, Brammer. We're down about 11%, I think double

02:51 digit losses so far yet today on the stock, which raises questions, is it

02:55 just sort of the final nail in the coffin for Apple not being part of the

02:59 Magnificent Seven? You know what was impressive about

03:00 yesterday, though, Alphabet down here tonight having a difficult year.

03:04 We've got Apple down year to date by double digits, throwing in another

03:08 surprise this week. We've priced out rate cuts again over

03:11 the last year. Okay.

03:12 You've got Apple down double digits, which used to be the market darling of

03:15 the stock market, the poster child for US tech and yet still the S&P 500 is up

03:20 by close to 10% year to date. Now we've talked a lot about things we'd

03:24 be surprised about in January sitting here saying, okay, if I told you Apple

03:28 was going to be down double digits in 2024 by the end of Q1, that we priced

03:33 out half the rate cuts we had priced and then said to you, the S&P 500 would be

03:38 up close to 10%. What is interesting is this goes to sort

03:41 of the broadening out and also this question of where are we in this credit

03:44 cycle? Where are we in this economic cycle?

03:46 People are saying late cycle last year now suddenly, Max Kutner of HSBC saying

03:50 maybe it's sort of early cycle behavior, given the fact that you're seeing, you

03:55 know, maybe potential signs of weakness. But where quits rate, is that really as

03:59 well as is as good as you can do? That was quite a change from Max Kent

04:02 over at HSBC. I read that story this morning.

04:05 This is not a bubble. This was this.

04:06 No, we're overweight, high yield credit and equities, overweight oil as a play

04:10 on the global economy, picking up the attitude, the sentiment shift has been

04:14 phenomenal in the last few weeks. And it is global.

04:16 And you're seeing that in flows. People diversifying outside of the U.S.

04:19 They want to sort of capitalize on a global growth wave, even though people

04:23 previously said it was from the U.S. and US exceptionalism.

04:26 Now it's us is crowded and let's move out and try to really just explore this

04:29 new early cycle behavior. Are we really early cycle because banks

04:33 are doing maintenance cuts at central banks are doing maybe because I don't

04:37 know the answer to that, but I think that's one kind of new theme that's

04:40 developing. I do know that this week is exhausting.

04:42 So let's get straight to it. Equity futures on the S&P 500 positive

04:45 by 0.1%. Here's the state of play.

04:48 Yeah, it's a little bit lower. Again, we're down three basis points on

04:50 a ten year for 2375. Coming up this hour, we'll catch up with

04:54 Bob Michael of J.P. Morgan on the Fed's path forward.

04:57 Bloomberg's Alex Webb on Apple becoming the latest target of Washington, and

05:01 Peter Oppenheimer of Goldman Sachs. With U.S.

05:03 stocks cruising to all time highs. We begin with our top story.

05:06 US stocks posting another record heading towards the biggest week of gains so far

05:10 this year. But Michael at JPMorgan Asset Management

05:12 write in this the soft landing continues to unfold everywhere with the tail risk

05:17 of reacceleration or contraction looking equally balanced.

05:20 What's the biggest risk Fed policy error?

05:23 Either they cut rates too soon or too light bulb joins us now for more.

05:27 Bob, good morning. Good morning.

05:29 Can you pick one for us? What?

05:30 It's the biggest risk out of those two options that the soft landing continues

05:35 to unfold for the next 18 months and people are still stuck in cash.

05:40 And every meeting I have and I've said this for the last several months, I've

05:43 been here, that's the first question I get.

05:46 I have too much cash. What do I do with it?

05:48 Where do I go? Everything's gone up in price.

05:51 What am I going to do? And I sit there and I wonder, how could

05:55 everyone have more cash? Yet every asset price has gone up.

05:59 Where the hell is it all coming from? Truly, the everything rally, we've seen

06:03 it in bonds, We've seen it in stocks, We've seen it in commodities.

06:06 You've seen it in gold. Can I ask you the question you've asked

06:08 yourself? Where is it coming from?

06:10 I don't know. But I've lived through this before and

06:13 it was 1995. We had our investment quarterly

06:16 yesterday. We talked about it at the end of 94.

06:19 It looked as though we were barreling into recession.

06:22 The Fed had doubled the Fed funds rate, U.S.

06:24 Steel had defaulted. You had the Tequila crisis, Orange

06:28 County defaulted. Everyone was 100% certain we were going

06:31 into recession and everyone was risk off.

06:35 And then we had that immaculate soft landing.

06:38 The Fed took the edge off of things. They cut rates from something like 6% to

06:43 five and a quarter percent, and the markets did fantastically well.

06:48 And we were talking about, well, surely going into that credit spreads must have

06:52 widened a lot. And Lisa Coleman, who runs credit for

06:55 us, looked at me and said, You asked me this question every three months.

06:58 No, in 94 they were dead flat. They didn't move a single basis point.

07:03 And we're seeing the same thing. The demons are at work.

07:07 People are worried about a reacceleration or we eventually will

07:10 roll into recession. They're waiting for a better buying

07:13 opportunity. Yet credit spreads are holding and

07:16 there's just still too much cash out there.

07:18 Which raises this question, have you shifted your stance a little bit on the

07:23 margins? You used to say that the biggest risk

07:25 was really a recession. That was your call.

07:27 Is this a new call for you, the idea that it's equally balanced now with a re

07:31 acceleration and potentially a real inflation problem?

07:34 Thank you for reminding me that a year ago we were all so certain that we were

07:39 headed into recession. And that's been, after all, the regional

07:43 banking system did blow up and it looked as though and the Fed still went ahead

07:49 and hiked rates a hundred basis points in in the first part of of last year.

07:55 And for sure it looked like recession. But in September we threw that away and

08:01 went to more of the soft landing cap. So so we've done reasonably well.

08:06 I, I sit here and we try to find where is a smoking gun, where the demons,

08:11 where where is there legitimate proof that actually there's a frailty that

08:17 will become manifest in the downside and it's too hard to find.

08:21 And actually there are more signs going the other way when we talk to the credit

08:26 research teams, whether it's investment grade or high yield, they're telling

08:30 their companies just look better that EBIDTA is starting to go up again, that

08:36 actually companies are more confident about their cash flow and their

08:41 earnings. So it actually feels that there's more

08:44 of a stabilization than downside. When you talk about where is the money

08:47 coming from, I'm struck by all of my conversations this week and over the

08:50 past couple of weeks about how much fiscal money has been pumped into the

08:53 system and how people who received it and companies that received it aren't

08:58 going to go out and spend it. And some of the line items they're going

09:00 to invest in stock market, which is part of the reason why and the bond market,

09:03 it's part of the reason why there's this wall of money just flooding in.

09:07 Is there a concern on the government bond side that there's going to be some

09:12 sort of coming home to roost with respect to the leverage being

09:15 transferred from the private sector to the public sector?

09:20 I don't think so. And and we also looked at the amount the

09:24 amount of money in plans like ARPA that have yet to be distributed.

09:29 There's still 44% of the trillion dollars that have been set aside that

09:35 have yet to go out into the economy. So that's already a sunk cost, so to

09:41 speak. And you're right, the policy stimulus

09:44 was literally off the charts. You had to go back.

09:48 When you look at the combination of fiscal and monetary, too, World War Two

09:53 to have any kind of relative metric. But we had the pandemic.

09:58 It's what we needed. It got us through it.

10:00 And now we're coming out the other side. It will take time to work down, but it

10:04 doesn't seem to be a problem. We can't be concerned about the amount

10:08 of Treasury supply out there when the entire Treasury curve is trading over a

10:14 hundred basis points through the Fed funds rate, except for the very front

10:17 end the two year. So there's still plenty of demand out

10:21 there. There is no alternate reserve currency

10:25 in the world other than the dollar, so there will always be concern Bitcoin.

10:30 Let's not go there this morning. It's too early for me to go, though, so

10:35 that there will be support for the dollar.

10:38 And the quickest, easiest way for a large official institution to maintain

10:44 dollar reserves is to buy Treasuries. We're not worried.

10:47 But to Lisa's point, do you think down the road you'll ever have this concern

10:51 of the path we're on in terms of the US deficit?

10:56 We are in the world of modern monetary theory where when there's a crisis even,

11:02 you know, the pandemic was a big one. The regional banking crisis, people want

11:07 to say it wasn't a crisis, but only because the policy response was

11:11 overwhelming. Governments borrow and the central banks

11:16 help to underwrite that. But it it doesn't just disappear into

11:20 the ether, right? The amount of fiscal stimulus you get

11:24 actually goes into the system somewhere. There is a credit multiplier, a credit

11:30 extension effect to it, and that's helped to boost the economy.

11:34 And we saw that early this year when the Treasury dialed back the expectation on

11:40 the amount of issuance, because guess what?

11:42 Tax receipts were up, which is exactly what you want when you apply that amount

11:47 of stimulus. So let's put together some of the things

11:49 you've told us so far. So the economy is pretty decent.

11:51 Biggest risk is upside risk and maybe the extension of this cycle for another

11:54 18 months. You mentioned the inversion of the yield

11:57 curve as well. So we've got a two year at the moment

11:59 about 460, a ten year at 424. Given everything you've told us, how are

12:03 you convincing clients to go further out along the curve to pick up less yield?

12:07 What are you telling them? Yeah, that's a really good question

12:09 because the Fed funds rate has to come down to 4% to legitimize the Treasury

12:16 curve where it is. And for sure, if it comes down to 4%,

12:20 the front end, the two year drops from 460 down to about 4%, but 5/10 thirties

12:26 stay about where they are. It's not so much that it's looking out

12:30 into the market, looking into the investment grade credit market where you

12:35 could pick up another close to a percent going into the high yield market, the

12:40 securitized credit market. That's where you're starting to pick up

12:43 yields that are in that five and a half and higher in high yield, close to 8%

12:48 range. And those are the kind of yields and

12:50 credit spreads that will come down once the Fed starts its rate cutting cycle.

12:56 You mentioned that with so much cash coming in.

12:57 Where is the cash going where you would direct and get at the moment?

13:00 What are the biggest things you're advocating for?

13:03 Well, we do like credit just because corporate America looks so good and I

13:11 myself have gone full circle on private credit.

13:14 It's so big. I accept it as a legitimate source of

13:18 non-bank lending into the system. Okay.

13:20 This is a change. What changed your mind?

13:23 Just. Well, one, the fact that it's larger in

13:27 size than the public high yield market. So that's pretty significant that it is

13:33 getting out there. It is lending to borrowers.

13:37 Those borrowers aren't just sitting on it.

13:39 They're actually hiring people. They're using resources.

13:43 They're creating economic activity. Even if you think put some unimaginable

13:49 default rate out there, 20%, that still means 80% Is money good.

13:54 And while there are problems that are ongoing right now, whether you want to

13:58 call, to amend and extend or exchanges or restructurings, they're occurring.

14:03 They're occurring and they're happening without all the fanfare if they happen

14:07 in the public markets. It's a strange form of re-insurance to

14:12 the public credit markets. So it's another reason we like the

14:15 public credit markets, because they just look so clean right now.

14:18 I love it. It's like, okay, shoot me to ribbons.

14:22 Okay. Good morning.

14:23 My name is Bob and I am accepting private credit.

14:26 I love how nice that they it just saying that coming up with the biggest comeback

14:30 for anyone who's been a surprise, I think it's great.

14:32 Can we finish by asking you a simple one, Bob, When was the last time you

14:34 were this bullish on your asset class? When was the last time you mentioned the

14:39 mid nineties? When was the last time you were this

14:40 bullish? Oh gosh.

14:46 You have to go back to to the mid 2000. Wow.

14:51 Yeah. Does that make you uncomfortable or

14:52 uncomfortable? As long as it's not 27,

14:56 it is. I feel great because I feel

15:00 post-financial crisis. We've sort of been in a la la land where

15:06 we there's there's been a lot of policy intervention along the way because it

15:13 was needed to recover from what happened during the financial crisis.

15:18 And they blame us The baby boomers we learned about leverage in housing, never

15:22 went down in price and we figured out how to blow it all up.

15:26 And it took over a decade to put Humpty Dumpty back together again.

15:31 And we see that's what's happening. We see that the 91 births are the

15:37 largest population cohort. They're turning 33 this year.

15:40 They're the dominant earner. Spend or save or I think we can toss

15:45 away the last 15 or so years and look at the period pre financial crisis when

15:50 there will be a demand for capital, there will be a cost to it and there

15:55 will be a productive use to it. So I'm I'm very optimistic.

15:58 This was thoughtful stuff. Bob, it's great to catch up with you.

16:01 Let's kick off this Friday morning and start to close out this week.

16:03 But Michael of Jp morgan, thank you, sir.

16:06 Let's get you an update on stories elsewhere this morning.

16:08 We can do that with your Bloomberg brief.

16:09 Here is you had a hacker. Sayonara.

16:11 Hi, John. Investors took a $113 billion bite out

16:16 of Apple's market value following regulator moves against the company.

16:20 The DOJ and 16 attorneys general filing a lawsuit accusing the iPhone maker of

16:25 blocking rivals from accessing hardware and software features on the iPhone, a

16:29 claim Apple strongly refuted across the Atlantic.

16:33 The company is also said to be facing probes about whether it's complying with

16:36 Europe's Digital Markets Act. Tesla has reduced electric car

16:41 production in China amid sluggish sales and intense competition in the world's

16:45 largest auto market, Sources telling Bloomberg the company instructed

16:49 employees at its Shanghai factory to lower production of both the Model Y

16:53 sport utility and model three sedan by working five days a week instead of the

16:58 usual six and a half. Nike warning investors sales will take a

17:03 hit later this year, pushing shares lower in extended trading.

17:06 The world's largest sportswear company says it's working to realign merchandise

17:10 to better match what shoppers actually want to buy.

17:14 Nike says revenue and earnings growing next fiscal year as it expects to see it

17:19 pay off from a $2 billion cost cutting plan announced back in December.

17:23 That's your Bloomberg brief. John Harris, thank you.

17:26 Up next on this program, the DOJ looking to rein in Apple.

17:30 We allege that Apple has employed a strategy that relies on exclusionary

17:34 anticompetitive conduct that hurts both consumers and developers.

17:39 We'll see how difficult that is to prove that conversation.

17:42 Up next.

17:59 Police are on the edge of turning bullish.

18:00 I don't know how that makes you feel. No, you just sit on.

18:04 Oh, you're just waking up this morning. You think?

18:06 What should I worry about? Data.

18:07 States and feds about to cut interest rates.

18:10 Stocks are at record highs. Everything is rallying.

18:12 Lisa is on the edge of turning bullish. Hold on.

18:15 I understand why this could continue. What worries me is that the wall of

18:19 money is going into specific areas that when the tide rolls out, they will

18:24 crash. I can come up with the bears that say

18:26 worries. Okay.

18:27 It's hard to see imminently on the edge of bullish.

18:30 You get like this close stimulus from every sides that you have close.

18:33 This has ever been. Never been this close to being bullish.

18:36 Equities right now positive almost the weak by 0.1% on the S&P 500.

18:41 Under surveillance this morning, the DOJ looking to reign in Apple.

18:46 We allege that Apple has employed a strategy that relies on exclusionary,

18:50 anticompetitive conduct that hurts both consumers and developers.

18:55 For consumers, that has meant fewer choices, higher prices and fees, lower

19:01 quality smartphones, apps and accessories, and less innovation from

19:05 Apple and its competitors. Here's the latest this morning.

19:08 The US Department of Justice is suing Apple, accusing the iPhone maker of

19:11 violating antitrust laws by blocking rivals from accessing hardware and

19:15 software features. Apple shares sliding 4.1% yesterday,

19:19 wiping out nearly $113 billion in market value.

19:23 Bloomberg's Alex Swift joins us now for more.

19:25 Can we start with the victims? Talk to me about this.

19:28 Who are the alleged victims of these violations?

19:32 So it's not necessarily other smartphone making companies, but it could be a lot

19:36 of people offering services on Apple's platform.

19:39 So we've heard complaints, for example, from Spotify about the way that actually

19:44 not only payments are taken, right, that they have to pay a certain cut to Apple

19:48 if someone signs up for Spotify on the device.

19:52 But also Apple would not let them tell their customers on the iPhone that if

19:56 you went and subscribed online, then you didn't have to pay that cotton.

19:59 It was cheaper there. The companies such as the people who

20:03 want to make mobile payments possible and contactless payments.

20:06 So at the moment you can only use Apple Pay with an iPhone.

20:10 One of the things that the DOJ is saying is that actually other services, perhaps

20:15 even like Android Pay, should be available.

20:17 So it's a lot of smaller companies offer.

20:20 I mean, Google is a smaller company, but not smaller

20:24 who are trying to offer products and services through the iPhone platform,

20:28 who the DOJ alleges have been squeezed out.

20:31 I don't know, Alex, who's waking up this morning, though, and shedding a tear

20:34 for, say, a credit card company like Visa or Bank that says that they can't

20:38 have a digital player when it comes to the Apple wallet.

20:42 But what is the DOJ remedy? Are they actually going to call for a

20:46 breakup? Well, you know, you talk about

20:50 behavioral remedies, right? So they'll be forced to actually change

20:54 some of the set up that they have in the device.

20:56 We've seen that already in Europe and many different ways in terms of the

21:01 menus you have for what is the default, for instance, search engine.

21:04 When you open a smartphone, what is the default then payment service that you

21:09 would use? These are the sort of behavioral

21:11 remedies that might be possible. There are other things, of course, you

21:14 know, other companies for smartwatch makers, for instance, who don't have the

21:18 same sort of smooth operation with an iPhone, as does the Apple Watch.

21:23 You have to they could be then forced to open some of those APIs to make it

21:27 easier for competing devices to have their data, for instance, appear in the

21:32 Apple Health app. What have we learned from other such

21:34 suits facing Apple about the fact that Apple says they need to do this for

21:39 security reasons? So Apple often makes this argument,

21:44 right, that this is about the quality of their service, of the quality of the

21:49 Apple experience, that if you let a bunch of other sort of unmediated,

21:55 unchecked apps and services onto the device, then it will be deleterious to

22:00 the customer experience, but also could affect security.

22:03 The counterpoint to that argument is sight is that ultimately that's the

22:06 choice for the consumer to make themselves.

22:08 If it is true that Apple's service and product line up is that much better and

22:14 that that gets worse if you let other products and services onto the iPhone

22:17 without Apple standing as a sort of gatekeeper in between, well, then that's

22:21 something that the market should be able to decide itself.

22:24 So, you know, there is a strong counterargument to Apple's assertion,

22:27 Alex, in a lot of cases that we've heard over the year going against Apple,

22:31 shares haven't sold off that much. A lot of people shrugged it off as just

22:34 sort of window dressing, regulatory theater.

22:37 Why is this different? This is probably the broadest kind of

22:41 full frontal assault that we've seen on the Apple ecosystem all in one go.

22:46 And we've seen a few sort of chips taken off Apple and of course,

22:51 other big tech companies by the European Union in in previous years.

22:56 The fact that this is obviously happening, Apple's home market is

23:00 meaningful now. Whether or not this leads to widespread

23:04 changes at Apple. You know, this is a long way to go and

23:07 that's a long way to run. Even if the DOJ were to come out with

23:12 some sort of victory, the changes aren't necessarily about

23:16 what changes on the device or changes on the operating system.

23:21 The fear is that it has an effect on the Apple culture.

23:25 This is something we saw Microsoft that when they were subject to years and

23:29 years of antitrust investigations and complaints, they became a little bit

23:33 wary about taking risks. And that is something that ultimately

23:37 was deemed to have hurt them and made them less competitive in the medium to

23:41 long term. Obviously, in extreme, long term,

23:43 they're now the most valuable company in the world again.

23:46 But that was a good ten or 15 year period where they were in something of a

23:49 wilderness. That is the concern of the sort of

23:53 massive effect that could have on Apple. So many different dimensions that

23:56 historic. Alex Webb, thank you, sir, have flown

23:59 back out of London on messaging Great Wall Street Journal op ed piece that you

24:03 sent so far. Is it federal law to require tech to be

24:06 inter operable? That's not clear at all.

24:08 It's not. It's not clear.

24:09 So what they need to do is show that this is a proper monopoly, which

24:13 potentially is going to be very difficult.

24:15 And we've seen Apple upheld what they uphold, what they do based on security

24:19 reasons before in court. So this is going to take years.

24:22 That stock's slightly positive in the free market.

24:24 Coming up, Headline backer of Ted Cowan from New York City.

24:27 This is pulling back.

24:37 40 winning streak on the S&P 500. Equities doing okay positive by 0.1%.

24:42 On the S&P, on the NASDAQ up by 0.1 yesterday.

24:45 Losses on Apple down by more than 4%. Losses of more than $100 billion on its

24:50 very large market cap. And yet still this NASDAQ 100 closed at

24:54 record highs. In the bond market, two year ten year 30

24:58 is quite a repricing at the front end of the curve through the week.

25:00 We've been all over the place for five days.

25:02 For seven days for 61. This morning, Lisa, we're down about two

25:06 or three basis points. And why not?

25:08 I mean, honestly, they're just following the direction from the Fed that

25:10 basically said they're not that concerned about data inflation data that

25:13 came in hotter than expected. They're on the right path and they plan

25:16 to cut. Now, we have a pretty good sized sense

25:18 in the markets that they are going to cut in June.

25:20 So it's off to the races. You've got federal funding, you've got

25:22 monetary policy both on the same page and let's go.

25:25 You know, it's had a really good week. And you ask the question that this week

25:28 and we're going to talk to some guests about it.

25:29 What's good for banks, High rates of lower rates.

25:32 Banks have had a great week, really stealthy run, five days of gains, I

25:36 think at 4.7% this week, best week since December.

25:38 If we close here. And I know we're going to talk more

25:41 about some of the capital markets activity, but how much of this is

25:43 because the green light that we've seen from monetary policymakers, but also

25:48 from the federal government has allowed new types of deal making, new types of

25:52 activity, money just pouring into the system and Mexico to capitalize on that

25:56 at a time where delinquencies are not picking up the way that some people had

25:59 expected them to at this point in the cycle.

26:01 Let's finish on foreign exchange. Something that has picked up over the

26:04 week is the US dollar. Believe it or not, Euro dollar is down

26:06 to 1.18, but negative by 0.4% this morning.

26:10 So some more dollar strength. We're leaning into cuts from elsewhere,

26:13 cuts out of Switzerland, hikes that don't work in Japan and potentially cuts

26:17 in the UK in the not too far distant future to the US economy keeps

26:21 outperforming. There are no signs.

26:23 Bob Michael just said he's hearing from different executives of small companies.

26:27 They're picking up. Every single analyst says that they're

26:29 going in the opposite direction. So at a certain point, why wouldn't

26:32 people still like the US as much as they don't want to?

26:35 And you talk to people, we want to diversify and then it doesn't work.

26:38 So we just do this again and again. So that's why people keep coming back to

26:40 literally everything with a dollar in front of it.

26:42 This rally this week, that's what it feels like.

26:44 Equities, bonds in foreign exchange, the US dollar.

26:47 It's been kind of wild under surveillance this morning.

26:49 The Justice Department taking aim at Apple, accusing the tech giant of

26:52 violating antitrust laws, wiping out $113 billion in market value.

26:57 15 states plus Washington, D.C., joining the complaint saying the iPhone maker

27:02 blocks rivals from accessing hardware and software features on its most

27:05 popular devices. Apple responding to the lawsuit saying

27:08 the case is wrong. Are the facts wrong on the law?

27:11 The news comes as the EU is also preparing new investigations into Apple

27:15 and Google for alleged violations of rules aimed at big tech.

27:18 And Lazio right to point out, typically this isn't a stock story.

27:22 It's just part of the environment that surrounds the likes of names like Apple,

27:26 Google and others, too. Yes.

27:28 So they found different. And I can't really wrap my head around

27:31 whether it's because this suit is different in its nature is Alex, what

27:35 we're saying it's broader and sort of challenges the fundamental aspects of

27:38 Apple or whether it's just sort of another thing on top of all the other

27:43 challenges that this company has. To me, it does feel different though,

27:46 and the fact that the market responded was unusual given some of the previous

27:50 track record. A It's been a downpour when it comes to

27:52 Apple in general. And John, your point to China, you have

27:56 Tim Cook actually in China right now trying to shore up this market.

27:59 That's incredibly important for Apple. But Dan Ives at Wedbush had this to say.

28:02 The antitrust lawsuit will, quote, kick off a stepped up phase of the Beltway

28:07 going after Apple. So is this more in the tank when it

28:10 comes to the antitrust regulators that are looking at Apple and potentially,

28:14 are we going to see more of this? I want to reduce it to one thing, but

28:17 the messaging thing, I just don't understand.

28:19 I don't understand it. And I'd love to hear from someone that

28:22 does understand it. It doesn't make sense to me at all.

28:24 You'll be ostracized from your group chat.

28:26 They're talking about actual social stigma.

28:29 The issue I also take with this is that maybe it's because I lived in Europe for

28:32 a lot of years. Most people are in group chat on

28:35 WhatsApp on a single precise forum. You don't need to be on an iPhone only.

28:40 I message group chat. I'm actually only on one.

28:43 You're not locked in. You can use other options on the iPhone.

28:46 I don't get it at all. And you mentioned the social stigma.

28:49 The social stigma. Is that something the DOJ needs to be

28:52 focused on now, the social stigma of messaging, of whether or not it shows up

28:56 green or blue on your phone, It is an important thing, ridiculous to be taking

29:00 up right now. We cannot tell Gucci they can't put the

29:02 label on the handbag anymore just in case that someone doesn't have a Gucci.

29:06 Right. And feels guilty.

29:07 Employment and the social stigma of it, that's just ridiculous.

29:10 Yeah, I think that they should look into it.

29:11 I mean, it seems like these are the important things that they should be.

29:13 I'm serious, though. This is where we begin.

29:15 Where does it end? You know, you're correct to say this,

29:17 and it's sort of how much are they grasping at straws to try to democratize

29:22 something that grew up out of a lot of smaller acquisitions over years?

29:25 Can you backpedal in time and undo that at a time or this is really a pretty

29:29 aggressively antitrust administration? The complaint includes a quote from Tim

29:33 Cook at a 2020 code conference and someone.

29:36 Raised their hand and said, I can't send my mom certain videos.

29:39 And then Tim Cook said, Buy your mom an iPhone.

29:42 And that's included in this lawsuit. Okay.

29:45 Let's move on to a stock that is doing alright better than alright.

29:48 Just yesterday, social media platform Reddit surging on its first day of

29:51 trading, shares climbing 48% and ending the day with a market value of 8

29:55 billion. Reddit's most loyal users were able to

29:57 buy 8% of the shares at the IPO price of $34.

30:00 The social media company also touting the benefits of artificial intelligence

30:05 while kicking off the fourth quarter IPO, fourth largest IPO of the year so

30:10 far. I'm not sure what the pace of all of

30:12 this, says Paramo. But if you saw that move yesterday, a

30:15 move of almost 50%, I'd be wondering if I'm just about to come public myself.

30:19 I'm encouraged, I think, by the move we saw.

30:21 That was my big takeaway. Basically, this is a green light to

30:24 everybody who wants to close out of investments.

30:26 If you think of private equity or if you're thinking about going public, and

30:29 that's one reason why I would suspect banks are kind of salivating and

30:33 chomping at the bit because this means a lot more deal activity.

30:35 I will just say it does remind me of Overstock coming out and mentioning

30:38 blockchain and all of a sudden their shares a furniture maker.

30:41 The shares surged, right? I mean, how much is it sort of similar?

30:44 You know, this company comes out says artificial intelligence and boom to the

30:47 races. And that's the time we're in at the

30:48 moment. Let's turn to FedEx rallying after

30:50 announcing a $5 billion stock buyback plan.

30:53 The company's earnings also were beating estimates and it offered an optimistic

30:56 outlook despite a difficult demand environment.

30:58 The results mark a turnaround in its express division after cutting costs and

31:02 reducing the company's workforce by nearly 22,000.

31:05 And I'm back to count joins us now for more.

31:07 And I am wonderful to hear from you as always.

31:09 Let's start with FedEx. The outlook for revenue growth is still

31:12 not great. Can you talk to us about just how much

31:14 of the heavy lifting in this company is being done now by cost cuts?

31:18 No, that's most of what we're seeing here.

31:20 The revenue lines were were down year over year.

31:23 And I think that's the key takeaway, that revenue was down and it's the third

31:28 quarter in a row. Our revenue is down and low single

31:31 digits and yet the earnings were up. And I think that speaks to the cost

31:36 cutting that we're seeing there in the middle of a $4 billion cost cutting

31:40 program by the end of the current fiscal year, May of 24, they'll have done 1.8

31:46 billion and then they'll do another 2.2 billion next year so that the 2026

31:51 fiscal year, they've got $4 billion taken out of costs.

31:55 And if there is a turnaround in revenue growth and actually we can talk about

32:01 the revenue, a lot of what you see in revenue is fuel

32:05 surcharges. So in a year or quarter in which you

32:08 have lower fuel prices, you're going to have headwinds on revenue and which is

32:13 part of why it's important to look at revenue excluding fuel surcharges, which

32:19 actually would have been a. So there are two things here.

32:23 Number one is what are the prospects of growth?

32:24 Why are people so excited if this is just cost cutting, that cannot be

32:27 continued in perpetuity? I would start there.

32:30 Why are people so optimistic that this is going to be a more valuable company

32:33 even after shrinking? Yeah.

32:36 So so some of what you have here is short covering.

32:39 There are a lot of people that were short going into the quarter.

32:42 If you look back over, I don't know, I've covered the company for 30 or more

32:46 years and it seems like most quarters, the stock does go down on the earnings

32:50 release. We've just had a couple where the

32:52 stock's actually gone up. But to the to the specific question, I

32:59 think at some point, you know, revenue starts to bounce along the bottom and

33:03 then you start to see improvement. You're not going to have this poor

33:08 revenue environment forever. Right.

33:10 Things do turn around and you start to get into easier comps as the year goes

33:15 on. And then they should they should start

33:18 to improve. But yes, they're going to be slightly

33:21 smaller company. I mean, we're still forecasting that,

33:24 you know, 20, 30, 20, 32, they do $100 billion in revenue

33:30 up from around 90, 91 billion now. But yeah, I think I think the focus in

33:35 the short term is cost covering is cost cutting, rather, it's it's one FedEx

33:40 getting rid of all the different operating companies and just focusing on

33:45 continuing to deliver a high quality product to their customers, to their

33:50 shippers, so that they can do 3 to 5 or 6% rate increases every year.

33:55 I mean, a lot of people look at FedEx, UPS, although they have their own

33:58 challenges right now as bellwethers of this economy, and that typically when

34:03 their revenues go down, it is a negative sign for consumer spending.

34:07 Right now, everyone's coming on trying to outdo the other in terms of economic

34:11 growth and in terms of investing in pretty much everything under the sun.

34:14 Is this a sign of caution that revenues actually came in lower at FedEx?

34:20 Yeah, I think well, some of it is the fuel surcharge.

34:23 So, you know, excluding that, you probably have flattish kind of revenues.

34:27 But yes, they did say that the US was weaker than they expected and that

34:31 international was not improving significantly and that there were

34:35 concerns. So I think what people look at the

34:39 consumer, a lot of what they see is consumer spend, retail spend or

34:44 spending. You know, for airlines, as we talked

34:48 about a couple of weeks ago when I saw you guys and and then you think about as

34:54 people return to their offices, I think three things to focus on.

34:58 One, as people return, B to B will start to improve.

35:01 Two, I think we talked a little bit about pricing.

35:04 So you have that. And then finally things will start to

35:08 wear out stuff that people bought in 2020 and 2021 will start to have to be

35:12 replaced at some point. So that will start to show improvement,

35:17 you know, maybe in another year or so. But yeah, they were they were really

35:21 optimistic. They were really upbeat

35:25 and very excited about a lot of the changes that are happening there.

35:28 And I think when you think about them being smaller, think about the Express

35:33 division being smaller and think about ground being bigger when you look at

35:37 FedEx potentially. Wall Street Journal is reporting a

35:40 stronger partnership with Amazon. Do you see that coming to fruition?

35:45 So that's interesting because of course, FedEx fired Amazon as a client about

35:50 five or seven years ago and now they're talking about getting involved with

35:55 Amazon really for returns, returns this big business.

35:58 And I think Amazon makes it very easy to do returns, right?

36:02 You can drop things off at various locations.

36:05 You don't even have to package it up. And FedEx is is building that business.

36:10 And so re-engaging with Amazon for returns may make some sense.

36:16 When when FedEx fired Amazon they were $1,000,000,000 revenue contributor

36:21 versus UPS. It's about $11 billion in revenue.

36:25 So it was relatively easy for FedEx to replace that revenue.

36:28 And then re-engaging with Amazon for returns is is obviously an opportunity.

36:33 Helane, thank you. We've got to leave it there.

36:34 Headline back of that of to count on the latest with FedEx.

36:37 Can we get the stock up quickly? Just have a look at where we're trading

36:40 in the pre market right now. I could do that on the Bloomberg if you

36:42 can't get it on the screen. I do that on the Bloomberg Shannon topic

36:45 so that would be a big move. I quite move Amazon which is sort of

36:49 raising this question how come there's so much ambition when it comes to this

36:53 idea of future growth when all of the positive energy really is coming from

36:57 pretty significant cost cutting? Let's get an update on stories

37:00 elsewhere. That stock is up by 12 and a half

37:02 percent here. You plan to operate with your horror

37:04 hackers. Hey, you horror.

37:05 Hi, John. Ending the fentanyl crisis is shaping up

37:08 to be a high priority for voters ahead of the US election.

37:11 A recent Bloomberg News morning console poll sees about eight in ten swing state

37:16 voters ranking the problem as an important factor in deciding their

37:19 votes. That's more than the number.

37:21 Who cite abortion, climate change, labor or the current wars.

37:25 Benson has been linked to more than a quarter of a million deaths since the

37:29 start of the pandemic. Aston Martin is tapping Bentley CEO

37:33 Adrian Hallmark to lead the luxury carmaker.

37:36 Paul Maker Hallmark will take over from outgoing CEO Amadeo Felicia, joining no

37:41 later than October 1st. Hallmark will be Aston Martin's fourth

37:45 CEO in four years. The announcement comes after the UK

37:49 carmaker completed a $1.4 billion refinancing earlier in the month in an

37:54 effort to ease concerns over the balance sheets.

37:57 Shares of Lululemon are lower in the premarket after the athletic maker

38:01 forecast a lower than expected sales outlook for the first quarter and the

38:05 full year. The company says visits to stores in the

38:08 US slowed at the beginning of the year. Lululemon has had a stellar

38:12 post-pandemic run and continues to post robust results, with analysts still

38:16 predicting the company will outperform its conservative guidance.

38:20 That's your Bloomberg brief. John Harris, thank you.

38:22 I'm next on this program, the US versus the rest of the world.

38:26 Expectations around growth and the performance of equities is expanding

38:30 outside of technology and outside of the US and into the rest of the world.

38:35 So, yes, it's this broadening out of growth.

38:38 We'll catch up with Goldman Sachs. Up next, Goldman Sachs looking to

38:42 diversify.

38:59 Equities on the S&P 500 positive here by 0.15% yields a little bit lower by two

39:04 or three basis points. We're down to four 2414 on a ten year

39:08 disadvantage this morning. The US versus the rest of the world.

39:13 Expectations around growth and the performance of equities is expanding

39:17 outside of technology and outside of the US and into the rest of the world.

39:22 The US does well to Japan does well. Asia does well.

39:26 The US just does a little less well than all of the other areas.

39:31 So yes, it's this broadening out of growth is the latest this morning.

39:35 Market dominance in the S&P 500 leading some investors to look elsewhere.

39:39 Peter Oppenheimer of Goldman Sachs writes in this We believe that there are

39:42 many companies outside of the US that should be considered as part of a global

39:46 diversified portfolio and should not be ignored simply because their base and

39:49 listing location is outside of the United States.

39:53 Peter Oppenheimer joins us now for more. Peter, let's get straight into this

39:56 because it's a really important theme. If it's winning, even if it's dominant.

40:00 Should I be concerned? Well, the short answer is no.

40:06 I mean, the outperformance that we've seen of the US, which has really been

40:10 particularly dramatic since the financial crisis, has been entirely

40:15 based on solid fundamentals, the US economy.

40:19 But most importantly, profits have simply outgrown those of other regions.

40:24 But as a result of that, its valuation has risen a lot compared to other parts

40:29 of the world. And now we're finally seeing a bit of a

40:32 narrowing in the relative fundamentals. Actually, profits are picking up outside

40:37 of the US where the valuations are lower and we think that the US market can

40:41 still do pretty well. But there's some great opportunities

40:44 outside. And diversification makes a lot of

40:47 sense. And that's true at the sector and the

40:49 stock level too. We can talk about those opportunities in

40:52 just a moment, but could we also discuss what we're fighting?

40:54 Are we fighting passive flows that just couldn't care less?

40:58 Yet to a large extent. Look, passive investing has worked very

41:01 well over the last decade or more in an environment of ever lower interest

41:06 rates, where bigger companies are becoming increasingly dominant and the

41:10 US equity market itself is got the highest share of the world market since

41:15 the early 1970s. So what's what's been winning is

41:18 continue to win and win over time. And that's been a great environment for

41:23 passive investment. We think that as interest rates

41:27 stabilize at a slightly higher level, sure, they'll come down cyclically, but

41:31 they won't come down structurally. Returns the index level is going to be

41:36 slightly lower and that's an environment where the opportunity set is more

41:40 attractive for active managers and also for more differentiation and diverse and

41:46 diversification. And that means across regions, across

41:49 sectors and styles as well. Peter, when you talk about the case for

41:53 international, I'm curious where you're looking in particular and whether it's

41:57 regional based or sector based, as you were just noting.

42:01 Look, it's a little bit of both. I mean, the US has done extraordinarily

42:05 well, partly because it's had a very high exposure to the growth factor,

42:12 principally dominated by technology, which has been the winning sector over

42:16 the last decade. We still really like technology.

42:19 We think the dominant companies have been justified again in their dominance

42:23 because of incredibly strong fundamentals.

42:28 But we think that you've got better relative valuation opportunities outside

42:34 geographically the US and indeed last year rather quietly, the Euro Stoxx 50

42:41 was slightly stronger than the S&P. Many people don't acknowledge that year

42:46 to date. Europe has outperformed not just the S&P

42:49 but the Nasdaq. So has Japan.

42:52 So it isn't that we don't like the US. It's gone up.

42:55 It's done well. But there are geographical opportunities

42:59 to diversify and I think that means also broadening out from technology.

43:03 We think technology is still going to be crucially important and do well.

43:07 But as interest rates come down and we get this soft landing, the opportunity

43:13 for broadening out into some more cyclical parts of the market is

43:16 improving. But also into non-tech companies.

43:20 We put together a list of what we call Etsy's X Tech Compounders.

43:25 These are global companies outside of the tech sector, which have strong

43:29 characteristics of reinvestment, a high rate compounding high returns, and they

43:34 tend to be somewhat cheap, but I think also offer good diversification

43:39 opportunities. Overnight, Peter, the Citigroup team,

43:41 the equity team over there, actually upgraded EU stocks with about 6% more

43:46 upside year to date in their view. And it's one of the highest in the

43:50 street. This is the reason why more certainty on

43:52 rate cuts. We've been talking a lot about that

43:54 global growth. You alluded to that and dollar weakness.

43:58 How much is dollar weakness necessary for this call to work?

44:03 Actually, I'm less convinced on the dollar weakness part of that story,

44:07 although I agree with the other comments that you made.

44:11 The European economy is growing at a much weaker pace than the US.

44:15 You know, we're looking at US growth this year of around 2.8% and in Europe,

44:21 about 0.7. But we shouldn't forget that the

44:24 European companies that dominate the indices are very global and therefore

44:29 they benefit from a recovery in global growth.

44:32 And in the global manufacturing cycle, which is beginning, beginning to happen.

44:37 And I think actually that what we find for European stocks is the growth trumps

44:43 currencies. Growth is accelerating.

44:45 European companies tend to do well. Even if the currency is actually

44:50 stronger now, it may well be weaker and that will add to its relative

44:54 competitiveness. But we don't think the currency is

44:57 actually the crucial part of this. It's much more about relative

45:00 fundamentals. Are earnings improving and as growth

45:03 improving, our interest rates coming down, all of those things suggest they

45:07 are. And Europe is only trading at around 13,

45:10 13 and a half times PE compared to something like 21 in in the US, the UK

45:17 only trades at around ten and a half times about half the valuation of the

45:20 US. And so there is a valuation opportunity

45:23 as well, which isn't really dependent I think, so much on currency.

45:26 Peter, When you look at India and China, you say India has good growth.

45:29 China can be a value opportunity. A lot of people moved to India because

45:35 they wanted to get away from China. Why do you see something interesting in

45:39 both markets? Well, I think that India is a bit of a

45:44 different story. It's got higher high growth rates, both

45:47 in terms of the corporate sector and in terms of the economy.

45:51 It's a relatively expensive market, but it's one that has good exposure to long

45:57 term growth and is benefiting a little bit from diversification of supply

46:01 chains and indeed diversification of investor focus away from China towards

46:07 India. China is a bit of a different story.

46:10 Is a valuation value play. I mean, the market trades at around

46:15 seven times earnings much, much cheaper. Of course, it has a lot more structural

46:20 headwinds and a higher risk premium giving given current developments.

46:26 And it's much less, I think, of a consensus than India.

46:30 But for a valuation like recovery, if we get any policy

46:35 stimulus, we think that there's there's reasonable upside, at least tactically

46:39 in that market as well. Got to finish on Japan.

46:42 It's just been amazing. Nikkei to 25 year today up by something

46:45 like 22%. I think we had a move over the last year

46:48 of something close to 50% PE when I buy the S&P 500 market cap weighted and I'm

46:54 buying, I'm buying megacap tech in a big way when I buy Japan PE.

46:58 Why am I think. Well, I think there's two things to say

47:01 about this. First of all, actually, just like the

47:04 US, both Europe and Japan have seen an increased concentration by stocks.

47:08 So the biggest three companies in Japan, which are very global, are actually the

47:13 biggest share of the thousand biggest that we've seen going back over several

47:18 decades. So you are getting dominant, large cap,

47:21 globally exposed companies doing very well.

47:24 I think that the Japanese market is much cheaper than the US.

47:28 Of course, it's gone up a lot, but we shouldn't forget it's only just broken

47:32 through the level that peaked at last in 1990.

47:37 And the fundamentals are finally very different because you're getting

47:41 expanding nominal GDP with finally coming out of that deflationary

47:47 stagnation that's dominated that economy over the last 25, 30 years.

47:52 But also quite a lot of restructuring stories because of bottom

47:59 up focus on improving return on investment from a low level.

48:03 So with rising margins return on equity going up, that justifies a bit more of a

48:07 higher valuation. But the dominant companies that really

48:11 are global companies in in areas around technology, high, high value added

48:17 manufacturing that benefit from a bit of a pickup in global manufacturing cycle

48:21 as well. And we think they're pretty well

48:23 positioned. John, always enjoy your thoughts.

48:26 Thanks for being with us. Peter Oppenheimer of Goldman Sachs on

48:28 the latest. Looking for a little bit more out of

48:30 stocks internationally, Nikkei to 25, four consecutive days of gains.

48:35 We were talking last week, Lisa, about what would happen, what would happen if

48:38 they hike interest rates, the yen rallies, what would it do to the Nikkei

48:40 to 25 so they hike interest rates. The yen did not rally.

48:43 No. Its stocks keep going higher.

48:44 Yeah, basically, this is the perfect combination for people to continue to be

48:48 bullish because they can buy at a discount and it looks like the currency

48:51 is going to be on their side. It's quite a run, more than 20% up yet

48:54 today. In the next hour of Bloomberg

48:55 Surveillance, we'll catch up with Mohammed al Aaron of Bloomberg Opinion

48:59 Michael Sheppard of bloomberg news, tracy mcmillion of wells fargo and

49:03 poonam go of bloomberg intelligence, all of that and a whole lot more with

49:06 equities closing once again at record highs and adding just a little bit more

49:10 weight to that rally this morning by 0.1%.

49:30 A lot of investors believe that the Fed is somehow a leading indicator.

49:34 The Fed is a lagging indicator, and the first few rate cuts that we see are

49:38 going to be driven by inflation in terms of inflation.

49:42 We've had a supply effect that I think has been maybe even more important than

49:46 the Fed. There is a sense that it's not just the

49:49 inflation point, but the supply point. Our expectation is inflation should come

49:52 back down towards 2% with growth still being okay.

49:55 This is Bloomberg Surveillance with Jonathan Ferro Lisa Abramowitz and

49:59 Annmarie Horden Hearn. At this point in the morning, I think we

50:03 really need to catch up with the equity market bear because the bullishness of

50:05 the first hour of this program has been absolutely overwhelming.

50:09 We have Bob Michael at J.P. Morgan Asset Management with us in the

50:11 last hour asked a very simple question When was the last time you were this

50:15 bullish? They said the mid 2000s laser on the

50:18 edge of bullishness with almost nothing to say back to him.

50:21 He was on the program. Okay.

50:22 Hold on a second. Everything he's saying rings true.

50:25 Companies from everything that we hear seem to be making good money.

50:29 There are some nodes of caution, FedEx, for example.

50:31 But on the flip side, how do you fight the Fed?

50:33 And I'm not just talking about the Federal Reserve.

50:35 I'm also talking about the federal government.

50:37 How do you fight both prongs? Basically, printing money.

50:40 The enthusiasm is overwhelming. And we had new all time highs in

50:43 yesterday's session, even with Apple. The full metallic of the equity market

50:47 rally in America down by something like four plus percent and losing more than

50:50 $100 billion of market cap. Absolutely.

50:53 And this has to come when you have the DOJ going after Apple saying that they

50:57 have a monopoly in how they're structured, basically talking about how

51:01 other companies, other apps, Jonathan, can't get into their software, cannot go

51:04 into the hardware. This, though, has been years in the

51:07 making. And one thing I find fascinating about

51:08 this as we talk about the upcoming election, where anything change, if it

51:12 was to go back to Trump, Trump 2.0, it won't.

51:15 This inquiry started in 2019 under the Trump administration, so the direction

51:20 of travel coming from Washington is very obvious.

51:22 Peter Oppenheimer of Goldman Sachs was saying, Look for opportunities outside

51:25 of America. And I've got very different views on

51:27 this. Based on their upgrade very recently,

51:29 many camera upgrade in their outlook from 4750 on the S&P to 5500.

51:35 And in a couple of words, just in one single line Paramo US exceptionalism is

51:39 going from strength to strength. Why would you want to fight it?

51:43 Well, here's the argument that people are saying, and this is actually exactly

51:46 the point that I was cuing in on, which is basically you have the US

51:49 exceptionalism that everyone was talking about being outside of the rest of the

51:53 world's weakness. It was the one bright light.

51:56 And now there is a question, is U.S. exceptionalism not being tamped down by

51:59 the weakness elsewhere, but actually expanding its golden rays across the

52:03 world with all of the potential profitability traveling worldwide?

52:08 This is a key question. Is it percolating outside of America or

52:11 is it remaining American exceptionalism that still hasn't been fully priced

52:15 structure? And despite widespread market optimism,

52:17 we view this as rational rather than excessive.

52:20 HSBC a little bit early this morning, Lisa, this is not a bubble.

52:24 That's what people keep saying because the earnings are there.

52:26 This, though, is really an interesting question.

52:29 This. Are they talking about the equity rally?

52:31 Are they talking about specific stocks that have gotten beat up very highly?

52:35 Are they talking about, you know, the equal weight?

52:38 That, I think is an important this because some people are talking about,

52:41 you know, how there are certain names that maybe have gotten a little over

52:43 their skis. We'll discuss this this hour.

52:46 Equities right now in the S&P 500 positive by 0.1%.

52:49 A little bit of a lift, big lift on the week heading towards the biggest weekly

52:52 gain of the year so far in the bond market running and to through the week,

52:56 yields are lower by two basis points, call it lower by almost 3 to 4 2414 on a

53:01 ten year and a euro weaker dollar stronger one away 18 on the euro dollar.

53:06 Coming up this hour, Mohamed El-Erian of Bloomberg Opinion as stocks hit their

53:10 20th record high this year. Tracie Mcmillion of Wells fargo on why

53:14 she says it's time to reduce risk in portfolios.

53:16 We found one. And bloomberg's Putnam goyle, as nike

53:19 says, sales will be squeezed during its sneakers shift.

53:23 We begin with our top story. Another day, another record.

53:25 The S&P clocking its 20th all time high this year on optimism the Fed will be

53:30 able to engineer a soft landing. Fed speak picking back up today with

53:34 Powell and Bostic all on tap. Joining us now to discuss, the president

53:38 of Queens College, Cambridge, Mohammed Al-Arian.

53:41 Mohammed, let's get straight into it. How overwhelming is the enthusiasm of

53:45 the last week for this market? It's totally overwhelming and for good

53:49 reason, drawn. Initially we had bottom up drivers,

53:53 secular themes that were very powerful, but that rally was narrowing.

53:59 Now suddenly you have a very powerful top down factor that has come in

54:03 enabling central banks that clearly are going to do what they want to do

54:08 regardless of selective data focus. So we can these two things coming

54:13 together are really powerful. We did the pre-game together.

54:16 We didn't do the post-game. So you were with us.

54:18 Fortunately, going into that news conference, were you surprised by what

54:21 came out of the news conference with Chairman Powell?

54:24 I was surprised by the extent to which he stressed patience in two ways.

54:29 Patience with inflation running higher, He basically dismissed the fact that

54:34 we've had some pretty surprising, hotter than expected inflation prints.

54:39 And then the second patience of the balance sheet saying, you know what?

54:42 We may get the slower than we would have otherwise, which means that monetary

54:47 policy is going to be more expansionary. That would have been otherwise.

54:50 So I was struck that on on the balance sheet, he took such a big step forward

54:55 when he could have waited till the next meeting to do that.

54:58 So we keep wondering what shoe is going to drop.

55:00 Right. We keep thinking everyone's bullish and

55:03 then more bullish and then bullish on top of bull.

55:05 And you have to wonder, okay, well, when does something break?

55:08 And we were talking on Wednesday. It's the inflation expectations that at

55:12 some point this is going to be a higher, more inflationary environment with a Fed

55:16 that is less willing to fight it. And yet I'm not seeing it and break even

55:19 rates. I'm not seeing it in other places that

55:22 you normally would. Why do you think that is?

55:24 You're seeing it in gold. Look at the reaction of gold, record

55:28 highs on gold. I think what you're having is and you've

55:31 all said it really well the of the everything rally so is going everywhere.

55:36 What's interesting now is this notion of market enthusiasm, not economic

55:40 enthusiasm. There's a big difference.

55:42 Market enthusiasm, Enthusiasm could spread to the rest of the world.

55:45 And that is quite a consequential statement.

55:48 If that occurs, then the US relative strength is going to be somewhat

55:54 diminished. I think it's actually too early to

55:56 pivot. I do think that, to use your phrase, US

55:59 exceptionalism, economic exceptionalism isn't going to expand to the rest of the

56:02 world. The US is really exceptional when it

56:04 comes to its economy. The others aren't doing what the US is

56:07 doing in terms of investing in the future drivers of growth.

56:10 They don't have the entrepreneurial society that we have.

56:14 They don't have the mobility of factors of production that we have.

56:17 The US is truly exceptional among other advanced economies.

56:20 So do you think it's rational for people to stay in the United States and to keep

56:25 adding more, even if valuations are at such high levels relative to the rest of

56:29 the world, to continue to kind of bet on this ship and not expect it to expand?

56:33 So I've been asked that question every single year for the last five years, and

56:37 every single year the US premium has increased and every single year I said,

56:43 Don't say the US too early. I see some argument for diversifying

56:47 away from the US purely on this enthusiasm and on relative valuation,

56:52 but I don't see it as strong. It is not being supported by

56:54 fundamentals. People have to realize this.

56:56 This is more betting on the momentum and I understand that the momentum factor is

57:01 very strong right now. You mentioned just a moment ago there's

57:04 enthusiasm for the stock market. There's not enthusiasm for the economy.

57:08 Well, doesn't that has that make any sense?

57:11 So what the reason why it makes sense and I've learned this the painful way is

57:16 that markets are not the economy. Markets can decouple from economies for

57:21 a very long time. And we've seen that happen over and over

57:25 again. But there are parts of the world, for

57:26 example, one of the biggest puzzle is while you've had a surge in inflows in

57:32 the US, high yield and corporate bonds, investment grade bonds, you haven't had

57:35 them in emerging markets and people conflict.

57:38 So we have this very peculiar situation whereby it is US investors.

57:44 Managing in the US investment grade bonds that are taking of benchmark bets

57:49 in emerging markets. And I think that's because most

57:51 investors think it's enough to be in the US.

57:54 You wear a few caps. Can we go to the Gramercy cap and talk

57:57 about what's happening in the and what's the reason for that?

58:00 What are you and the team over at Gramercy thinking about em at the

58:02 moment? I think that people have been hurt so

58:06 much and people like same reason why so many people are in cash.

58:10 They think they can get adequate returns from safer places to be in.

58:17 If we were looking at em and we saw a central bank that appeared to tacitly

58:20 accept high inflation for longer, I think we'd be doing something very

58:23 different with the assets of that country, particularly with the currency.

58:28 Why is it different with the US? Because the US issues the reserve

58:31 currency. Because the US is the place where people

58:35 outsource their savings to be managed. The US can misbehave quote unquote much

58:41 longer and in a much bigger way than any other country in the world.

58:45 Which is a reason why we've all been waiting for this to show up in longer

58:48 term bond yields and waiting and waiting and asking lots of people the question.

58:52 And everybody says it's not going to happen because we're the reserve

58:54 currency of the world. At a certain point, is the concern about

58:58 inflation only going to show up in gold? Is this the only place or will you start

59:02 to see it wake up? Is that something that you're willing to

59:05 bet on? Look, we've set aside three concerns

59:09 that are still in play. We just are not focusing on them right

59:13 now. One is the US deficit and the tremendous

59:17 amount of issuance. I remember being with you back in

59:21 October where the question was, who's going to buy all these bonds?

59:24 No one cares like that. So that's issue number one.

59:27 Issue number two is we've taken a small step in Japan for exiting from a highly

59:33 distorted monetary policy regime. And we have a really long journey ahead

59:37 of us. But no one is asking the question, will

59:40 Japanese investors have to sell all these foreign securities have bought?

59:44 And of course, the third one is the banking system.

59:46 There are this is not a banking system issue.

59:48 This is a few banks that are still facing difficulties and that is going to

59:53 play out this year. But it's not a banking system issue.

59:56 You talk about Japan and let's go there for a minute, because they did come out

59:59 with some inflation numbers overnight that were hotter than expected.

01:00:02 And yet people aren't concerned because it seems like the BOJ put is as

01:00:06 consistent as the Federal Reserve put in terms of not over hiking or being

01:00:10 overambitious about how much to really tighten the screws.

01:00:14 Does that make you think, you know what, even if that's a sort of outside threat,

01:00:18 that's not going to happen. This isn't a normalizing cycle.

01:00:20 This was simply ticking the goalpost a little bit further out the field.

01:00:24 So, Lisa, you're doing what John does, which get me on a Friday and then I

01:00:27 front run my Financial Times article coming out next week.

01:00:31 It's okay. No one's listening.

01:00:34 Go on. So I think we're going to look back this

01:00:39 week on This Week as the week in which central banks abandoned.

01:00:45 A point inflation target for a range that we're going to look back and say

01:00:51 this was the point when they realised in the case of the Fed, for example, it's

01:00:55 no longer a good idea to have a 2%. Let's have 2 to 3%.

01:01:00 It's not it's going to happen in a very slow way.

01:01:03 Is gone. The first step was taken this week.

01:01:05 When you acknowledge that inflation will be higher.

01:01:08 You acknowledge growth will be higher, but you see straight through it.

01:01:12 Japan, same thing happen. So we're going to look back and this is

01:01:16 my hypothesis on this, as this has have been a really important moment, but it's

01:01:20 going to play out very slowly. Japan is going to play out very slowly.

01:01:24 They will tolerate hotter than expected inflation for much longer than anybody

01:01:28 expected. Now, we've seen the equity market.

01:01:30 That's music to your ear as long as it doesn't get out of control.

01:01:33 And so far, inflation expectations have been relatively well anchored, as you

01:01:37 said, raises questions about what it means for the bond market.

01:01:40 We'll talk about the consequences of that a bit later.

01:01:42 That was the greatest promotion the Fed's ever had.

01:01:45 MOHAMMED That we had to do it to me every single week.

01:01:48 But it's good for everyone. We get a little bit, they get a little

01:01:51 bit. Everybody wins, okay?

01:01:54 It's the everything rally. It's literally everything.

01:01:56 It's simply thank you. It's going to stick with us in place to

01:01:58 say for most of this hour, let's give an update on stories as to why this

01:02:02 morning. Here's your plain fact Brace with your

01:02:03 horror hack case. How you horror?

01:02:05 Hi, John. Reddit rose 48% in its trading debut

01:02:08 yesterday with the social media company closing up more than $50 a share.

01:02:13 That's well above its IPO price of $34. Investor enthusiasm for the listing,

01:02:18 driven by the company's pitch to profit from the growth of artificial

01:02:21 intelligence. Reddit's IPO is the fourth largest on a

01:02:24 US exchange this year. At Market Close, the company had a

01:02:28 market cap of $8 billion. Investors took $113 billion bite out of

01:02:34 Apple's market cap following regulator moves against the company.

01:02:38 The DOJ and 16 attorneys general filed a lawsuit accusing the iPhone maker of

01:02:43 blocking rivals from accessing hardware and software features on the iPhone, a

01:02:48 claim Apple strongly refuted across the Atlantic.

01:02:51 The company is also said to be facing probes about whether it's complying with

01:02:55 Europe's Digital Markets Act. And Tesla is pulling back electric car

01:03:00 production in China amid sluggish sales growth and intense competition in the

01:03:04 world's largest auto market. Sources telling Bloomberg the company

01:03:08 instructed employees at its Shanghai facility to lower production of both the

01:03:12 Model Y sport utility and model three sedan by working five days a week

01:03:17 instead of the usual six and a half that's here.

01:03:20 BLOOMBERG Jon O'Hara, thank you. Up next on this program, regulators

01:03:23 closing in on Apple. Apple has maintained its power not

01:03:28 because of its superiority, because of its unlawful exclusionary behavior.

01:03:34 That conversation coming up next live from New York City this morning.

01:03:38 Good morning.

01:03:56 A four day winning streak on S&P 500 longest winning streak got back to where

01:04:01 they separate at a similar way to that. S&P 500 futures right now up by 0.15% on

01:04:07 the S&P, calling it the everything rally.

01:04:09 Here's a little bit more of it. Bonds rally in gold silver by two basis

01:04:12 points for 2414. Crude up by a 10th of 1%, $81 on WTI and

01:04:17 the dollar stronger the euro down to one away, 21 under surveillance this

01:04:21 morning. Regulators closing in on Apple.

01:04:25 Apple has maintained its power not because of its superiority, because of

01:04:31 its unlawful exclusionary behavior. Monopolies like Apple's threaten the

01:04:36 free and fair markets upon which our economy is based.

01:04:40 If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone

01:04:45 monopoly. Here's the latest this morning.

01:04:47 The DOJ suing Apple, accusing the tech giant of blocking rivals from accessing

01:04:51 iPhone hardware and software features. Apple raising $113 billion in market

01:04:56 value. The iPhone maker pushing back, saying

01:04:59 the lawsuit could, quote, set a dangerous precedent.

01:05:01 Empowering government to take a heavy hand in designing people's technology.

01:05:05 Bloomberg's Michael Shepherd joins us now for more from D.C..

01:05:08 Shep, can we just stop with the so-called Apple monopoly?

01:05:11 What are they getting at here? Well, what the Justice Department

01:05:15 alleges is that there are certain features that people value in

01:05:18 smartphones that Apple is tinkering with in a way that creates an advantage.

01:05:24 This includes cross-platform messaging, say, between Apple devices and Android

01:05:28 devices. It includes digital wallets and also

01:05:31 support for non-Apple smartwatches. And then finally, also cloud streaming

01:05:36 services. And what it is saying is that Apple is

01:05:39 putting its thumb on the scale in a way that hurts not only consumers, but also

01:05:43 the makers and innovators in these areas who are not named apple.

01:05:48 Shep the Wall street journal editorial this morning comes out and says the suit

01:05:51 also claims apple has, quote, suppressed mobile cloud streaming video services by

01:05:55 requiring each to be submitted as a standalone app for approval.

01:05:58 And they say lol, as the kids say, because the FTC claim that Microsoft

01:06:02 Activision Blizzard acquisition would create a cloud video game Monopoly.

01:06:07 So is the DOJ, FTC, these these regulators basically talking out of both

01:06:13 sides of their mouth. Well, that is in a way, what it looks

01:06:16 like. And that is certainly what Apple will

01:06:18 try to argue, because when you pass Apple's statement from yesterday

01:06:24 and Jonathan was good to show an element of segment of it, in short, they are

01:06:29 saying that they're being punished for being innovative, for succeeding and for

01:06:33 drawing consumers. They say that, look, we don't blame us

01:06:37 for people liking our products, for people gravitating to what we have to

01:06:41 offer because of enhancements like security that people really value and

01:06:46 that we're able to bring by setting higher and different standards for

01:06:50 access to our app store, for instance. Let's talk about the politics of this.

01:06:54 We have seen a robust regulation from the Biden administration, a more amped

01:06:59 up DOJ, FTC. But this lawsuit, the inquiry of it

01:07:04 started in 2019 under Trump. Do you expect whether we get Trump or

01:07:08 Biden, this is the direction of travel? It's an interesting question, Emery,

01:07:13 because we are in an election year and there's a lot of questions about what

01:07:17 the Trump administration, if he is elected, to return to the White House,

01:07:23 what a Trump administration would do in terms of its enforcement of the market.

01:07:28 In this case, it's interesting. Donald Trump did not have a huge love

01:07:32 affair with the tech industry and the Justice Department under Trump.

01:07:36 Also, as you said, started this case, but also pursued it on a lot of the same

01:07:41 grounds that we are seeing here articulated by the Biden administration

01:07:45 and also in the Republican Party under Trump.

01:07:49 There is a strong libertarian streak. We are seeing the party increasingly

01:07:54 reject scale, in part because Trump is trying to make that appeal to the little

01:07:59 guy voters, so to speak. Shep, I got to say, i know it's kind of

01:08:03 a fool's errand, but i'm looking for consistency.

01:08:05 I want to understand what the framework here is in terms of what the desired

01:08:10 outcome is. Is it national champions?

01:08:12 Is it smaller companies? Is it a democratization of tech?

01:08:17 Is it trying to push up tech behemoths so they can compete with China?

01:08:21 What is it? You know, that's a great question, Lisa,

01:08:24 in the way, what is the end goal? And when you look at the president's

01:08:30 platform, Biden nomics, the whole question of competition enforcement is

01:08:34 important. And what they want to ensure is that

01:08:37 innovation is not stifled, but that also consumers are not hurt.

01:08:41 And it doesn't only apply to tech, although it's getting a lot of

01:08:44 attention, of course, in the past few days with Apple.

01:08:47 But it does extend to other areas. We saw the Biden administration's

01:08:52 antitrust enforcement who sued to block the Kroger's acquisition of Albertsons,

01:08:57 for instance, trying to crack down the concentration in the grocery aisles.

01:09:01 So so there is something when you hear from the president's top economic

01:09:06 advisers, when Amery and I and Washington have talked to some of the

01:09:09 administration officials and asked them about biodynamics, this whole question

01:09:13 of fair competition to preserve innovation and fair pricing is something

01:09:18 that is very much on their mind. I think they're thinking less of so much

01:09:22 national champions and they are trying to make sure the playing field is a

01:09:25 little bit more equal. They are concerned that over the past

01:09:29 few decades we haven't seen as rigorous or robust antitrust enforcement as the

01:09:34 public and innovators deserve a chef. Great to hear from you.

01:09:38 Michael Shepherd there down in Washington, DC on the latest with Apple.

01:09:41 I'm thinking about who wins, Lisa. A lot of lawyers who are going to make a

01:09:45 lot of money. And then I'm thinking of South Korea and

01:09:48 China. I mean, who wins here?

01:09:50 It's going to be foreign smartphone makers.

01:09:52 That's who wins here. And it comes at an interesting time

01:09:54 ahead of what Samsung is expected to do, which is launch an AI infused phone.

01:09:59 That's going to change. Our sort of experience is what they are

01:10:02 saying. And we have Apple racing to catch up

01:10:04 with the Gemini partnership of Google. You just have to wonder what's the

01:10:07 ultimate goal? And if you don't have one, how do you

01:10:10 sort of create enough consistency to give people the confidence to actually

01:10:15 make deals to go out? Have a framework, a rubric for their

01:10:18 business? I mean, there's some real questions

01:10:19 here. This came up at Bank of America this

01:10:22 week. How do you get together and have a

01:10:23 conversation about doing a deal where you feel like if you're about to be

01:10:26 acquired and you sign up to that, you could be hung out to dry for a whole

01:10:29 year, waiting for the regulators to decide whether or not it's bad for

01:10:33 business. And on the flip side, you've got a

01:10:34 regional banking crisis that people say, well, there's just too many banks, there

01:10:38 are too many banks too. So you need to have more consolidation.

01:10:40 But we don't want consolidation because we don't want to have dominance.

01:10:42 It's sort of it's it's it's a little bit mind bending.

01:10:45 So please forgive me. And Mohammed, let's talk about this.

01:10:48 How interventionist is America becoming? Is becoming more interventionist?

01:10:52 I don't think there's any question about that.

01:10:54 But the more interesting question is, does it need to be more interventionist?

01:10:58 There is a view, which I must say I have some sympathy with that industrial

01:11:02 policy is going to be really important in pivoting from old style growth models

01:11:07 to new style growth models. And you're seeing it not just in the US,

01:11:10 you're seeing it elsewhere as well. Well, this is actually one of the

01:11:12 reasons why when we're talking about don't fight the Fed, the Federal

01:11:15 Reserve, but also don't fight the federal government because this kind of

01:11:17 industrial policy is going to be crucial if you want to shift away from some of

01:11:20 these supply chains. I remember maybe a year ago when people

01:11:23 thought this would be inflationary. Six months ago, people thought this

01:11:25 would be inflationary. Three months ago, probably going to

01:11:28 increase pricing. Now people don't care why.

01:11:32 The reason why people don't care is because inflation has been coming down

01:11:37 and it has come in been coming down without a sacrifice and growth.

01:11:40 So it's not a top issue right now, but it's inflationary.

01:11:44 Yes, it's inflationary. Of course it is.

01:11:46 All the restructuring that's happening in the global economy other than life

01:11:50 sciences are inflationary. The rewiring of supply chains for

01:11:55 geopolitical reason, inflationary, the rewiring of supply chains because

01:11:58 companies want more resilience and not just efficiency.

01:12:01 Inflationary. What's happening in the labour market in

01:12:04 terms of mismatches between skills and and what people have, that's

01:12:09 inflationary. So you have all this going on on the

01:12:11 other side. You have the promise of AI, you have the

01:12:14 promises of life sciences, and people right now are completely focused on the

01:12:18 promise and are willing to live with all these other restrictions ongoing.

01:12:22 We posed the question earlier on this week and there was actually a really

01:12:25 decent piece in the Wall Street Journal yesterday.

01:12:27 Not sure if they've been watching Bloomberg Surveillance through the week

01:12:29 or not, but whether America is becoming more like China as opposed to an area

01:12:33 where we believe China would become more like the United States.

01:12:36 Is America becoming more like China? That's like saying that AI as old and

01:12:41 unfit as I am and becoming more like an Olympic athletes, you know.

01:12:46 Could I take a small step? Yes.

01:12:49 But am I coming becoming anything like that person?

01:12:51 No, I'm not saying they're going to become full communist overnight in

01:12:54 Washington, D.C. There might be some Republicans worried

01:12:56 about that in the Democratic Party. I'm not saying that.

01:12:58 I'm just saying we look a little bit more like them than they do us in the

01:13:02 last couple of years. And that's not what we expected.

01:13:05 Well, we look a little bit more like here.

01:13:06 We've realized that government has to play a bigger role in enabling the

01:13:11 private sector. And we've realized that private public

01:13:14 partnerships matter. Mahamat is going to stick with us.

01:13:17 Coming up next on the program, we found a little bit of an equity market there,

01:13:20 which is refreshing because everyone on this program at the moment is very, very

01:13:24 bullish. Tracy Mcmillion of Wells Fargo.

01:13:26 As the S&P 500 hits its 20th all time high in 2024.

01:13:31 That conversation up next live from New York City.

01:13:33 This is Bloomberg.

01:13:53 What a week for stocks on the S&P 500. The rally continues.

01:13:56 Equity futures on the S&P up by 0.1%, just about unchanged on the NASDAQ.

01:14:00 They've been spoiled, though, all time highs at the close yesterday on the

01:14:03 Nasdaq 100. The banks have been tremendous.

01:14:06 Talk so much about tech in a video, stealthy rally in the financials, the

01:14:10 banks on the S&P up for five consecutive days, up close to 5% so far this week.

01:14:15 And some really decent gains year to date from the likes of Jp morgan,

01:14:18 Goldman and others. Jp morgan coming out this week and

01:14:21 saying it was increasing its dividend for the second time in 12 months.

01:14:24 So just to give you a sense, they have so much money, they don't know what to

01:14:26 do with it. They're just to funnel it back to

01:14:28 shareholders, which kind of gives you a sense of where we are.

01:14:30 I was looking at the year to date gains for some of the financials, up 17% on Jp

01:14:34 morgan, up 19% on Citi, Bank of America up 11 over the last year.

01:14:38 So you have to remember 12 months ago was like the ding dong lows of the

01:14:41 central bank malaise and regional banking crisis, if we can call it that.

01:14:45 We can't call it that, can we? You didn't like that word.

01:14:47 Regional banking stress of last spring. Jp morgan is up 60%, Goldman's up 36,

01:14:53 cities up 47%. And Bank of America is up about 40%

01:14:57 since then. This kind of relates to the conversation

01:14:59 we were just having, which is how much have they been gaining share from some

01:15:03 of those regional banks that were facing not a crisis, but stress at a time when

01:15:07 they really are the main players? I mean, again, it goes to this question

01:15:10 of is their strength a good thing or is it sort of coming at the expense of

01:15:14 those that some of the politicians want to protect?

01:15:17 Really, it's it's it's a curious moment right now.

01:15:19 Well, the banks are doing better, that's for sure, as is pretty much everything

01:15:22 else. I'm not going to weigh in on that.

01:15:24 I know that it's sensitive on market. So your ten year 30 at just briefly

01:15:27 here, this goes for you. You go to lower by two or three basis

01:15:30 points for 61 on a two year. We can finish on foreign exchange first

01:15:34 hike first hike from the DOJ in 17 years.

01:15:37 And again on the week, we've had a move of 1.7% in the dollar's favor against

01:15:42 the Japanese yen. So weaker yen on the weak.

01:15:44 Lisa one 5157 And it goes even to this point of we got how does it expected

01:15:49 inflation in Japan and yes we're seeing a little bit of yen strength but not

01:15:53 much nothing to write home about. Honestly Mohamed El-Erian column that

01:15:56 he's going to be publishing is a really good one about how it's sort of been a

01:16:00 shift, a sea change with respect to the rate hiking cycle and the potential rate

01:16:05 cutting cycle and the potential of running inflation between two and 3%

01:16:09 rather than 2%. I was speaking to T.K.

01:16:11 yesterday and I feel inspired. Let's.

01:16:13 What is he saying? Rip up the script?

01:16:14 Yes, let's do exactly that. Yeah.

01:16:15 Let's go to this piece that's coming out in the Financial Times next with I spent

01:16:19 a few minutes on that instead. What you said is really important that

01:16:23 perhaps central banks are tacitly accepting higher inflation rates without

01:16:27 actually formalizing this in any specific way, because some of these

01:16:30 central banks actually need the government to do that for them.

01:16:33 I just wonder what the consequences of that are going to be.

01:16:35 And I'm with you, Mohammed. This week was the first baby step

01:16:39 towards potentially, I stress, potentially something much bigger.

01:16:43 We saw that and the contradiction in the 24 projections.

01:16:46 And for those of us who maybe missed that, if you take it, I'm happy to go

01:16:50 through it again. The Fed Reserve came out with a medium

01:16:52 projection for 2020 for unemployment, a little bit lower growth, a whole lot

01:16:57 stronger, and CPI was revised a little bit higher, Inflation expectations were

01:17:02 firmer, yet still the median just showed three cuts for 2024.

01:17:07 Now we were trying to work out if that was just a small contradiction that they

01:17:10 could iron out. Chairman start speaking in the news

01:17:12 conference and he didn't seem fussed by it at all.

01:17:15 Didn't seem bothered by the optics of it, the substance, nothing.

01:17:19 What do you think we're going towards? And we mentioned the consequences.

01:17:22 What are the consequences going to be? The financial markets.

01:17:26 So I think the critical thing is when he said the story has not changed.

01:17:30 So we could have argued over three cuts versus two cuts.

01:17:34 All you need is one more member to move its furious accuracy.

01:17:37 But when the chair says the story has not changed, when you've had three

01:17:42 hotter than expected inflation prints and you've revised up your inflation

01:17:46 projection, I think that's a real message.

01:17:48 As the story change for bond markets, then, well, we see it in what's

01:17:52 happening in the bond market. Yes.

01:17:53 I mean, the bond market is now realizing that finally the curve is going to

01:17:57 steepen and it's realizing that we are going to tolerate higher inflation for a

01:18:02 while, but that inflation is going to be what anchored that.

01:18:05 That is a very consequential statement. So this is important because we've been

01:18:08 trying to figure out if this is good or bad for the long end of the curve.

01:18:12 Short end if they want to come, we know what happens.

01:18:14 It's influenced by the policy rate. I think Lisa was first to ask this

01:18:17 question following the news conference. What does it mean for Bonds?

01:18:19 What does it mean for the longer end of the.

01:18:21 And I remember sitting here with three Misra and she said, Don't take me there.

01:18:24 I want to talk about the front end. I want to talk about the belly of the

01:18:27 curve. Don't take me to the long end, because

01:18:30 things get ambiguous when you get beyond five years where we're taking you there,

01:18:34 What does it mean for the ten year? So I think for this year, an average ten

01:18:38 year yield of 425 around where we've been is reasonable.

01:18:43 We're going to be quite volatile around it, but that's going to be reasonable

01:18:47 and the excitement is going to be elsewhere

01:18:50 in the curve. Which raises the question, is this a

01:18:53 correct move that basically it is important for the Fed to have a little

01:18:57 bit more flexibility and 2 to 3% is a more.

01:19:01 Stimulative kind of environment for the economy to avoid the trap that we got

01:19:05 into of disinflation for so many years. So he would go full into the article

01:19:08 now. Okay,

01:19:11 So paragraph.

01:19:13 Here we go to answer your question. It is not without risk, but it is the

01:19:19 right move. It is not without risk because at some

01:19:22 point you could destabilise inflation expectations.

01:19:26 But it is the right move because we are living in a different macro paradigm.

01:19:29 We live in a paradigm where supply is inflexible enough globally and if you

01:19:34 try to run a 2% inflation target, you will end up sacrificing economic

01:19:39 well-being unnecessarily. So.

01:19:41 Does it concern you that some people are speculating just your comment about how

01:19:45 markets are not the economy, that a lot of the inflation is asset inflation.

01:19:49 It's not real world inflation because lower income families are the ones most

01:19:54 likely to spend and are the ones who are most at least likely to really benefit

01:19:58 from some of the rally that we're seeing in asset prices.

01:20:00 How much does it divorce financial markets from the fundamental economy in

01:20:05 a way that could be potentially harmful? I mean, that's been the story of QE.

01:20:08 That's why there was a call for people's QE, the recognition that the generosity

01:20:13 of the central bank was was going to a very small group of people who owned

01:20:17 assets. Look, let's not.

01:20:21 I tried to hide it. The low income people have not recovered

01:20:25 from a 9% inflation hit. Yes, their wages are going up more.

01:20:29 But the cumulative impact of the inflation we've seen since 2021 has been

01:20:34 significant. And if you don't believe me, go to food.

01:20:36 Food. Have a look at what the you know, I talk

01:20:40 to one food bank in particular and they're still seeing long lines of

01:20:44 people. So underprivileged segments of society

01:20:47 have been hit hard by inflation. The good news is that wages at the lower

01:20:51 levels are going up faster than they have been in the past.

01:20:55 But the inflation hit was painful. And that also explains why, despite U.S.

01:21:01 economic exceptionalism, it doesn't get reflected in President Biden's.

01:21:07 Polls on the economy. It doesn't get reflected because people

01:21:10 remember inflation. And for many people out there, when you

01:21:14 tell them inflation is better, they'll say, well, prices aren't coming down.

01:21:17 They think that if inflation is better than prices will be coming down.

01:21:20 So, well, frame to Mohammed, the second plank of the piece coming out Monday.

01:21:24 Coming up Monday, Tuesday. Okay.

01:21:25 Tuesday, Tuesday, they're going to send somebody copies.

01:21:28 On Tuesday, the soft landing trade in full force.

01:21:31 The S&P 500 notching the 20th all time high of the year.

01:21:33 We found someone who's a little bearish trace amount, billion of Wells Fargo,

01:21:37 same risks ahead with a weakening, consumer cash stockpiles diminishing and

01:21:41 delinquencies on the rise. Tracy, I'm pleased to say, joins us now

01:21:45 for more. Tracy, you've been looking forward to

01:21:46 this because everyone that's come on the program so far is overwhelmingly

01:21:50 constructive on this equity market. What don't you like?

01:21:53 Let's start there. Okay.

01:21:55 Well, I think to call us a bear might be a bit of an overstatement.

01:22:00 So relative to work with us, I would say that we're

01:22:04 medium term optimistic. What we're seeing is that markets can't

01:22:11 keep going up indefinitely. As you mentioned, the 20th day this year

01:22:17 that we have hit all time highs on the S&P 500.

01:22:20 I did the math. That's about one every three days we're

01:22:24 hitting all time highs, so about a third of the time this year.

01:22:28 So that said, we could see some weakness, we think, through the summer

01:22:34 as growth starts to slow down a little bit.

01:22:38 And then we could see a rebound towards the end of the year.

01:22:41 But we really don't see prices moving much higher than where they are today.

01:22:47 So some weakness through the summer, then perhaps a rebound back to the

01:22:51 levels where we are today by the end of the year.

01:22:54 So, Tracey, the lesson of the pre-pandemic markets were that people

01:23:00 had the frame of mind that you may get a sell off but is going to rebound.

01:23:04 And we never got those sell offs because people immediately put money to work on

01:23:11 any sign of a sell off. Why would it be different this year?

01:23:16 Yeah. So we don't think it's going to be

01:23:19 different this year. In fact, typically within a 12 month

01:23:24 period, we do see about a 10% correction.

01:23:28 So we think that that is possible this year.

01:23:32 We do think that, yeah, we saw some really strong growth last year.

01:23:37 Market the S&P 500, I should specify, is up 35% over the last year.

01:23:43 And we just think it's probably time to take a pause there.

01:23:49 And that would be an opportunity not necessarily to buy more large caps

01:23:56 because we're already overweight, large caps, but potentially to broaden our

01:24:01 exposure into things like small caps and potentially even emerging markets.

01:24:07 This is just amazing. The biggest bear on the street, we might

01:24:10 possibly maybe see some weakness, maybe not bearish.

01:24:13 I mean, I'm not bearish. You call me a bear is ridiculous.

01:24:16 So here's my question. Is this ultimately a valuation story or

01:24:19 are you actually seeing weakness that people aren't recognizing whether it's

01:24:23 in companies or in consumers? Yeah.

01:24:27 So one of the things we have been pointing out is that the equity risk

01:24:31 premium right now is very unattractive relative to bond yields.

01:24:36 So valuations are high. Absolutely.

01:24:40 But, you know, experience teaches us that that doesn't necessarily provide us

01:24:45 with a good timing tool. Or so

01:24:49 although valuations are high, they could go higher.

01:24:53 So it can persist, especially if equity investors think that earnings growth has

01:24:58 upside risk, which is what we think we're seeing right now, Does mean,

01:25:03 though, that we think that stocks are increasingly priced for perfection.

01:25:08 So that increases the chances that we could see a pullback on some

01:25:13 disappointing news. Does that mean that you're increasing

01:25:16 your exposure to bonds? You say that there's probably a better

01:25:18 risk premium placed on bonds. And I'm looking right now at investment

01:25:22 grade credit spreads at their tightest level going back to November 2021.

01:25:26 That still is more attractive. Yeah.

01:25:30 So we do think that bonds at four point to 4.5, 4.6, if we were to see that

01:25:38 range and that's a good entry point for the long term, we are not necessarily

01:25:44 adding to our bond positions at this point.

01:25:47 Instead, we have already overweighted short term fixed income and we think

01:25:53 that that will provide some additional cash to go into riskier assets.

01:25:59 You know, somewhere down the line when the opportunity looks more attractive.

01:26:05 Tracey, we were talking a few minutes ago about all this concern from a few

01:26:09 months ago about issuance. We're going to see massive issuance.

01:26:14 Who's going to be buying all those bonds?

01:26:16 Has that disappeared? I don't know that that is necessarily

01:26:22 disappeared because we are still running budget deficits.

01:26:25 So there is still the need to fund those budg
