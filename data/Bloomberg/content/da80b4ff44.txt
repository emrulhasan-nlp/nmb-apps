00:13 >> THE BAR FOR THE FED TO CUT IS LARGELY FROM THE INFLATION

00:16 FRONT SHOWING CONTINUED MODERATION.

00:20 >> THE MARKETS PRICING AND THIS SUMMER.

00:21 I THINK IT'S QUITE REASONABLE.

00:23 >> IT IS VERY LIKELY YOU COULD SEE THESE RATE CUTS GET PUSHED

00:29 BACK. THERE IS A CYCLICAL RECOVERY

00:32 BREWING IN THIS ECONOMY WHICH MAY NOT SUPPORT THAT CUT.

00:37 >> THE BASELINE REMAINS TWO OR THREE CUTS IN JUNE.

00:41 HOPEFULLY WE HAVE LESS CLUTTER ABOUT A HIKE OR NO HIKES.

00:47 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE WITH JONATHAN

00:50 FERRO, LISA ABRAMOWICZ AND ANNMARIE HORDERN.

00:52 JONATHAN: IT'S LIKE THE WEEKEND NEVER

00:54 HAPPENED. MONDAY MORNING THIS IS WHAT

00:57 EVERYONE IS FEELING. HORRENDOUS. LISA:

00:59 THERE'S NO REASON TO DO DAYLIGHT SAVINGS PRAYED ITS

01:04 IMPROVEMENT TO BE INCORRECT AND DOES NOT HAVE ANY ENERGY

01:09 SAVINGS PRAYED PEOPLE WANT THE ROMANCE OF A LONG WINTER,

01:14 SUMMER VACATIONS, LONG SUMMER EVENINGS AND BARBECUES.

01:16 JONATHAN: YOU KNEW OUT OF EVERYTHING THIS

01:17 A BE THE ONE THING THE WIND YOU UP. NOT MARKETS, NOT CPI.

01:24 LISA: DON'T YOU FEEL THE SAME? JONATHAN:

01:28 LET'S GET YOUR WEEK STARTED. GOOD MORNING, GOOD MORNING.

01:34 YOU FUTURES NEGATIVE BY .1 ON THE S&P 500 BRAIDED GOOD NEWS

01:36 IS GOOD NEWS. HOW ABOUT NO NEWS IS GOOD NEWS.

01:41 LAST WEEK WAS A NO NEWS WEEK. THE ABSENCE OF BLOWOUT NUMBERS

01:45 LAST WEEK I THINK THAT IS WHERE IT'S AT. LISA:

01:49 IT SHOULD BE GOOD NEWS AND IT WAS GOOD NEWS FOR THE BOND

01:52 MARKET PRAYED IS A GOOD NEWS FOR THE DURATION OF A STOCK

01:55 MARKET RALLY THAT'S SHOWING SOME SIGNS OF MAYBE THE

01:58 LEADERSHIP GETTING TIRED AND THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE FOCUSED

02:01 ON. OR IS SOME OF THE VOLATILITY MOVES WE'VE SEEN IN THE LIKES

02:06 OF NVIDIA LEANING INTO THIS FEELING THAT MAY BE THE

02:08 MAGNIFICENT SEVEN AREN'T SO MAGNIFICENT. JONATHAN:

02:14 IN THE PREMARKET WE ARE POSITIVE ON FRIDAY THIS STOCK

02:16 WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE SO AT ONE POINT IT WAS POSITIVE.

02:21 I THINK WE WERE ON A SIX-DAY WINNING STREAK UP BY 19

02:23 PERCENTAGE POINTS ON NVIDIA. FRIDAY'S SESSION WAS KIND OF

02:26 OFF GIVEN THIS MOVE IN THE STOCK. LISA:

02:31 YOU AT 250 BILLION DOLLARS OF MARKET VALUATION YOU LOST AFTER

02:37 THIS WILD RIDE UNDERSTANDABLY IT'S UP SOMETHING LIKE 87% THIS

02:38 YEAR. NO ONE IS CRYING FOR NVIDIA BUT

02:41 IT RAISES THIS QUESTION ABOUT WHAT THIS VOLATILITY MEANS

02:46 THINGS ARE TOPPING OUT. YOU'VE CALLED THIS MANY TIMES

02:51 BEFORE BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT THEY NOTICE OVER

02:52 THE WEEKEND. JONATHAN:

02:58 WE ARE BUILDING ON PAYROLLS FROM FRIDAY LOOKING AHEAD TO

02:59 CPI AND RETAIL SALES. THE REACTION FROM DEUTSCHE BANK

03:02 REMAINS THE SAME. IT WAS AN AMBIGUOUS JOBS REPORT.

03:09 BANK OF AMERICA RESILIENCE NOT RE-ACCELERATION.

03:14 WE WILL CATCH UP WITH BE AVAILABLE BIT LATER.

03:18 >> WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT WHAT THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WILL

03:20 BE TOUTING, THEY HAVE THEIR BUDGET REPORT, THIS IS JUST

03:26 BASICALLY GIVEN THE FACT IT'S ON POLICIES THE PRESIDENT COULD

03:29 EASILY ENACT PRAYED WHAT I FOUND SO INTERESTING OVER THE

03:32 WEEKEND LOOKING AT THE JOBS AND WAITING FOR INFLATION PRINT.

03:34 PRESIDENT BIDEN WAS SIGNALING A NOTE TO THE FED BECAUSE WHEN HE

03:37 SPOKE AT A CAMPAIGN EVENT FRIDAY EVENING HE SAID I CAN

03:42 GUARANTEE IT BUT YOU BET THOSE RATES ARE COMING DOWN MORE

03:44 PRAYED IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN. HE DOES NOT LIKE TO ASSERT

03:48 HIMSELF. HE SAYS THE FED IS INDEPENDENT

03:51 BUT WE SAW THIS WITH THE PRIOR JOBS REPORT. JONATHAN:

03:55 I'M NOT SURE THE LAST TIME THE FEDERAL RESERVE WAS REFERRED TO

03:59 AS SUCH. THE -- I THINK SPELLING TROUBLE

04:04 FOR BIDEN. TWO THINGS STAND OUT. AMERICANS ASSESSMENT OF THE

04:10 ECONOMY BETTER SINCE NOVEMBER. THE IMPROVEMENT OF BIDEN'S

04:15 HANDLING OF THE ECONOMY FLATLINING OVER THE SAME PERIOD.

04:18 THAT'S NOT TRANSLATING INTO BETTER POLLING FOR THE

04:22 PRESIDENT. LISA: THE NUMBERS ARE SHOCKING GIVEN

04:26 THE FACT HIS APPROVAL RATING IS 36% FOR HIS HANDLING OF THE

04:30 ECONOMY AND GET A MOST HALF OF U.S. VOTERS ASKED OF LIVING

04:34 COMFORTABLY ARE ABLE TO MEET EXPENSES WITH A LITTLE BIT LEFT

04:35 OVER. THE INFLATION SHOCK IS EBBING

04:39 BUT THE INFLATION SHOCK FOR HIS RATINGS NOT SO MUCH PRAYED

04:42 ANNMARIE: WE SEE THIS IN POLLS AND ALSO

04:43 IN THE MICHIGAN SURVEY. GETTING AN UPDATE THIS WEEK.

04:49 AMERICANS ARE STARTING TO FEEL BETTER ABOUT THEIR FINANCES,

04:52 BETTER ABOUT THE OVERALL ECONOMY BUT THEY ARE NOT GIVING

04:53 THE CREDIT TO BIDEN. THIS IS THE GAP HE NEEDS TO

04:56 OVERCOME. JONATHAN: LET'S START WITH SOME PRICE

05:00 ACTION. EQUITY FUTURES NEGATIVE ON THE

05:02 S&P 500. EQUITIES COMING OFF THE BACK OF

05:09 WEEK LOSSES REALLY MUTED MARGINAL STUFF.

05:12 DOWN ONE QUARTER OF 1% ON THE S&P. 4.0672%.

05:20 WE HAVE SEEN THE MOVE LOWER IN YIELDS ON THE TWO-YEAR, 10 YEAR.

05:23 LISA: THAT'S THE KEY QUESTION IF YOU'LL SEE THAT CONTINUE THIS

05:25 WEEK.

05:31 WHEN YOU GET CPI TOMORROW, PPI ON THURSDAY AS WELL AS RETAIL

05:35 SALES, INITIAL JOBLESS CLAIMS PRAYED ON FRIDAY WE GET

05:39 UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, TODAY THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH OIL

05:44 PRICES WILL INFLUENCE PPI AND THEN ON THE HEELS OF ALL OF

05:47 THAT IN CASE YOU ARE WONDERING THERE ARE A HOST OF BOND

05:49 AUCTIONS AT A TIME WHERE HAVE SOME OF THESE YIELDS GOTTEN TOO

05:52 LOW. WE'VE GOT THREE OR NOTES BEING

05:54 AUCTIONED TODAY. 10 YEAR BEING AUCTIONED

05:56 TOMORROW.

06:01 >> TONS OF SUPPLIES THROUGH THE WEEK. GETTING YOU THROUGH THE

06:09 ESTIMATES OF THAT MONTH OVER MONTH, COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS

06:13 MONTH, LOOKING AHEAD TO THIS WEEK'S INFLATION DATA.

06:15 TERRY HAINES OF PANGAEA POLICY.

06:22 ANDREW OF CITY ON THE FENCE -- ON THE FED'S PATH FORWARD.

06:26 A BIG WEEK AHEAD FOR GLOBAL MARKETS GOING INTO NEXT WEEK'S

06:28 FED DECISION. INVESTORS CPI REPORT AND RETAIL

06:30 SALES JUST A FEW DAYS LATER. WRITING OUR CALL FOR A MARCH

06:37 CUT AND THEN ANOTHER IN MAY WILL PROBABLY PROVE TO DOVISH.

06:39 AND WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. THE MORE LIKELY OFFER, GIVING

06:44 ITS FIRST CHANCE TO REDUCE THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE.

06:48 JEFF, GREAT TO CATCH UP WITH YOU.

06:55 IS THAT ONE INFLATION PRINT, TO INFLATION PRINT OR THREE?

06:59 >> I THINK YOU WILL KEEP THAT QUITE CLOSE TO HIS OWN CHEST

07:01 AND PROBABLY LEADS TO MORE.

07:07 NOT JUST TO HIT EXPECTATIONS BUT TO SURPRISE THE DOWNSIDE.

07:11 STARTING THE YEAR A BIT TO DOVISH AND EXPECTING THESE TWO,

07:15 EARLIER THAN EXPECTED. WE WILL GET CUTS THIS YEAR,

07:20 THERE'S TALK OF NO LANDING OR NO CUT.

07:23 WITHING THE MARKET WILL STOP PRICING THAT OUT OF THE VERY

07:26 LEAST. JONATHAN: WE WILL GET A NEW SET OF

07:28 OUTLOOK IN THE SUMMARY OF ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS.

07:32 POLICYMAKERS PUTTING IN WHERE THE THINK FED RATES WILL BE.

07:34 ALL OF THAT STUFF.

07:35 WHEN YOU PLUG IN THOSE EXPECTATIONS NEXT WEEK WILL

07:40 THEY LOOK ANY DIFFERENT TO WHERE THEY WERE BACK IN

07:43 DECEMBER. GEOFF: IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE GUIDANCE

07:52 AND I THINK POWELL WITH MOST OF THE OTHER FOMC MEMBERS WHAT

07:56 THEY NEED TO DO IS NOT WHAT SEVERAL ECB HAWKS ARE SAYING

07:59 WHICH IS WE NEED TO CONFIRM THE DATA CONFIRMS WE GET TO 2% FOR

08:03 WE CAN CUT RATES BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THE DEFINITION OF

08:06 GETTING BEHIND THE CURVE. YOU NEED TO GET AHEAD OF

08:10 DISINFLATION SO THIS MEANS FROM Q2 ONWARDS EVERY MEETING WILL

08:13 BE A LIVE MEETING.

08:15 >> A LOT OF PEOPLE PERHAPS YOU CAN TAKE THE NO RATE CUT PEOPLE

08:17 OUT OF THE EQUATION BECAUSE THEY STARTED BY SAYING THERE

08:20 BEING A LITTLE RIDICULOUS. MOVING FORWARD IT SEEMS THAT

08:24 THERE'S FEWER RATE CUTS BEING PRICED IN THE U.S. THAN EUROPE.

08:28 I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE EURO HAS REMAINED SO RESILIENT.

08:32 WHAT'S YOUR TAKE?

08:36 >> I AGREE AND I THINK MARKETS WHETHER IT'S A POSITIONING

08:41 ISSUE WHEN THE MARKETS OVEREXTENDED ITSELF IN TERMS OF

08:43 DOLLAR HOLDINGS THAT I THINK THERE WILL BE A POINT OF

08:47 RECKONING WITH THE ECB ACKNOWLEDGING THE EUROPEAN

08:50 ECONOMY FACES SEVERE ISSUES WITH REGARDS TO MANUFACTURING.

08:55 THE DEMAND IN THE EURO ZONE LOOKING AT IMPORTS FOR EXAMPLE

08:58 WHETHER YOU LOOK AT THE MATERIAL SIDE OF THINGS, THE

09:00 CONSUMER GOODS VERSUS MANUFACTURING GOODS.

09:02 DOUBLE DIGIT CONTRACTION. THAT IS EXTREMELY WORRYING AND

09:08 I THINK THE ECB AND AT THE VERY LEAST NEEDS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE

09:11 EURO IS TOTALLY MISALIGNED WITH WHERE THE ECONOMY IS NOW.

09:17 I'M STILL HOLDING ONTO MY VIEW THAT IT SOME POINT THIS YEAR WE

09:22 WILL GET PARITY IN EURO-DOLLAR PRAYED THERE WILL BE THAT POINT

09:23 WHERE THERE'S A TOTAL REVISION OF THE EXPECTATIONS FOR RATE

09:25 CUTS AND IF YOU COMPARE WITH THE FED FOR EXAMPLE, THEY MAY

09:29 START CUTTING A BIT LATER BUT THE PACE WILL BE ONE PER

09:33 QUARTER. WE WILL LOOK AT CONSECUTIVE 25

09:36 BASIS POINT MOVES. FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR.

09:40 THAT'S WHERE THE GAPS ARE REALLY GOING TO START TO OPEN

09:46 UP.

09:46 >> TO SOME DEGREE WE HAVE STARTED TO PRICE THIS AND FIXED

09:50 INCOME. WE HAVEN'T SEEN IT PUSHED

09:51 THROUGH THE FX MARKET IN A STRONG WAY IN A WAY MAYBE YOU

09:54 WOULD EXPECT. LISA IS ASKING WHY HASN'T THAT

09:56 HAPPEN? GEOFF: I WOULD GO BACK TO THE DOLLAR

09:59 POSITIONING VIEW.

10:05 U.S. REAL RATES AND NOMINAL RATES

10:09 RELATIVELY HIGH SO FOR YOUR RISK-FREE ASSETS YOU OWN THE

10:10 DOLLAR. IF YOUR RISK ON ASSETS YOU OWN

10:13 U.S. EQUITIES IS NOTHING IN BETWEEN

10:16 AND PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT THAT AS A HEDGE AGAINST THAT

10:17 OVER POSITIONING IN THE U.S.. AT THIS POINT IT'S THE WRONG

10:21 ASSET TO OWN.

10:27 MAYBE IT'S TIME TO START LOOKING AT ASIA AGAIN. LISA:

10:33 WE DID SEE THE RECESSION THAT WAS PRICED IN WAS PRICED OUT

10:40 COMING IN AT A POSITIVE 0.4% OVER IN JAPAN.

10:45 DO YOU THINK BASICALLY THIS IS BASICALLY A VERDICT ON NEGATIVE

10:47 RATE POLICIES THAT THEY WILL SUCCESSFULLY BE ABLE TO EXIT

10:51 LATER THIS MONTH IN MARCH OF THE TIME FOR THE BANK OF JAPAN?

10:55 >> MARCH IS CERTAINLY A LIVE MEETING LOOKING AT THE GDP DATA

10:59 THEY ARE ALSO LOOKING AT THE UNDERLYING DATA IN TERMS OF

11:04 WAGES. THEY ARE DEFINITELY COLLECTING

11:07 ALL THE INTEL FROM JAPANESE COMPANIES AND SEEING UPSIDE

11:12 SURPRISES AND THEY KNOW THEY NEED TO FLIP EXPECTATIONS AT

11:13 THE VERY LEAST NOW. THE CHALLENGE TO THE MARKET IS

11:18 REPRICED FOR BIG FIGURES LOWER. IS THERE SCOPE FOR MORE?

11:26 THE FEELING IN THE MARKET STILL POSITIONED AND SEE WHETHER THE

11:28 BOJ CAN SURPRISE THE HAWKISH SIDE.

11:30 THE BAR HAS BEEN RAISED FOR THAT.

11:36 >> I WONDER IF THE CHALLENGE FOR THE MARKET IS JAPANESE

11:39 EQUITIES OFF THE BACK OF WHAT YOU THINK MIGHT HAPPEN ON

11:44 DOLLAR-YEN.

11:45 WE HAD A FIFTH STRAIGHT DAY OF YEN STRENGTH INDICATING 25 WERE

11:48 THE WORST DAY SO FAR THIS YEAR. WHAT'S THE RELATIONSHIP GOING

11:50 TO BE? SO FAR WE'VE LEARNED WE DON'T

11:55 NEED A TON OF YEN WEAKNESS. WHAT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

11:59 IS WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU GET A SEVERE ABOUT OF YEN STRENGTH.

12:04 A MOVE FROM 150 TO 140, I DON'T KNOW BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE

12:06 LONG JAPANESE EQUITIES. WITHIN THEIR ALL ASKING THE

12:09 SAME QUESTION. WHAT HAPPENS?

12:15 GEOFF: JAPANESE AUTO MANUFACTURERS

12:20 FROM WHERE THEY'VE GONE BY THERE LOOKING AT BETWEEN 100

12:22 AND 110 WHICH MEANS THE JAPANESE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE AT

12:26 THOSE LEVELS THEY CAN PROBABLY REMAIN PROFITABLE.

12:30 BASICALLY MY RULE OF THUMB WOULD BE YOU HAVE A NUMBER IN

12:32 MIND AND BECAUSE OF THE INTERNAL HEDGING STRATEGIES YOU

12:36 HAVE TO GO BELOW THOSE FAIR VALUE NUMBERS BEFORE THE

12:39 NUMBERS START BECOMING A HEADWIND TO EARNINGS.

12:43 I WOULD NOT WORRY ABOUT THAT AT LEAST FOR THE NEXT 20 FIGURES.

12:47 >> WHAT WILL INTERNATIONAL INVESTORS BE WILLING TO PAY FOR

12:51 AS WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW REACTIVE WILL THEY BE TO SEEING

12:55 A JAPANESE YEN APPRECIATE THE FASHION MAYBE WE SHOULD BE

12:57 ANTICIPATING? GEOFF: IT'S ABOUT PACE AS MUCH AS

13:00 LEVELS. IF YOU TOLD THE EARNINGS ESTIMATES THAT WERE GOING TO BE

13:08 AT 130 NEXT QUARTER THAT STALKING A SERIOUS ADJUSTMENT.

13:10 IF IT'S GOOD TO BE A GRADUAL MOVE CONVERGENCE TO FAIR VALUE

13:16 MORE IN LINE WITH THE IMPLIED VOLATILITY I THINK THAT CAN BE

13:19 ABSORBED QUITE EASILY. SO MANAGE THE PACE RATHER THAN

13:20 THE LEVEL. JONATHAN:

13:26 A LOT OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND JAPAN.

13:28 JAPANESE EQUITIES PULLING BACK A LITTLE BIT BUT STILL UP 16%.

13:35 LISA: WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY DO EXIT

13:41 THE NEGATIVE RATE POLICIES PRAYED ON THE ONE HAND YOU

13:43 THINK THIS WOULD DRAW MORE CAPITAL INTO JAPAN WHICH MIGHT

13:46 BE A POSITIVE. IT'S A REAL PROBLEM IF YOU WANT

13:48 TO DISCOUNT. THE OTHER ASPECT IS THE BANK OF

13:54 JAPAN AND THE BALANCE SHEET WHAT HAPPENS TO THE ETF THEY'VE

13:57 BEEN PURCHASING AND ALL OF THE OTHER TYPES OF STIMULUS?

14:00 >> MASSIVE INFLUENCE NOT JUST OF THE BOND MARKET IN STOCKS AS

14:04 WELL PRAYED NEGATIVE BY .16%. UP NEXT, BIDEN'S REDLINE FOR

14:09 NETANYAHU.

14:15 >> THE DEFENSE IF ISRAEL IS STILL CRITICAL SO THERE'S NO

14:17 REDLINE WHERE WE WILL CUT OFF ALL WEAPONS BUT THERE ARE LINES

14:22 IF HE CROSSES, YOU CANNOT HAVE 30,000 MORE PALESTINIANS DEAD.

14:25 >> THAT CONVERSATION COMING UP NEXT. GOOD MORNING.

14:31 ♪

14:48 JONATHAN: LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY THIS

14:49 MORNING, THE MORNING. A WEEK OF LOSSES LAST WEEK

14:54 TALKING ABOUT .2%. YIELDS BASICALLY UNCHANGED ON

14:58 THE 10 YEAR 4.07%. THE EFFECTS MARKET GOING

15:01 ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE. UNDER SURVEILLANCE THIS

15:06 MORNING, BIDEN'S REDLINE FOR NETANYAHU.

15:12 >> THE DEFENSE OF ISRAEL IS STILL CRITICAL SO THERE'S NO

15:16 REDLINE I WILL CUT OFF ALL WEAPONS, THEY DON'T HAVE THE

15:17 IRON DOME TO PROTECT THEM. YOU CANNOT HAVE 30,000 MORE

15:22 PALESTINIANS DEAD. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF GOING AFTER

15:24 THEM. THERE'S OTHER WAYS TO DEAL TO

15:32 GET TO, TO DEAL WITH THE THREAT BY HAMAS.

15:37 >> PRESIDENT BIDEN WARNING ISRAEL.

15:41 CEASE FIRE TALKS WITH HAMAS HER MAIN DEADLOCKED AS THEY ENTER

15:42 THE HOLY MONTH OF RAMADAN. WONDERFUL TO HAVE YOU WITH US

15:46 THIS MONDAY MORNING. I'M TRYING TO WORK OUT THIS

15:52 DIVISION BETWEEN THESE TWO LEADERS OR IF THIS IS JUST A

15:56 CONVENIENT MEDIA NARRATIVE GIVEN THE DEMENTED POLITICS IN

15:59 THE U.S..

16:00 >> I'M WITH THE SECOND. A SITUATION WHERE THE PRESIDENT

16:07 IS DOING HIS BEST TO STRADDLE AND IT'S NOT IN THE END IT'S

16:10 NOT REALLY PLEASING ANYBODY. SECONDLY I WOULD LOOK AT IT

16:14 FROM THE ISRAELI POINT OF VIEW AS WELL, THE PRESIDENT'S

16:20 FOREIGN POLICY ABROAD EVEN WITH ALLIES IS NOT BEING GREETED AS

16:26 A PARAGON OF STRENGTH OR CONSISTENCY GOING BACK TO THE

16:31 AFGHANISTAN WITHDRAWAL SO THERE WAS THIS FICTION BEING

16:33 GENERATED IN THE UNITED STATES THAT THE UNITED STATES CAN HAVE

16:38 A HAND IN THE ISRAEL HE RESPONSE -- ISRAELI RESPONSE.

16:44 WHAT YOU'VE GOT HERE WITH THE PRESIDENT IS A MUCH MORE

16:47 POLITICAL LINE HERE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. ANNMARIE:

16:50 THIS TIME LAST WEEK BIDEN WAS HOPEFUL WE WOULD SEE A CEASE

16:55 FIRE. HOW MUCH STRAIN IS NOT HAVING A

16:58 CEASE FIRE GOING TO CAUSE IN HIS DEMOCRATIC BASE?

17:02 >> IT WILL CAUSE A CONTINUED STRAIN THROUGHOUT.

17:08 SINCE THIS WAR IS NOT AN END QUICKLY AND THE PROBLEMS CAUSED

17:12 BY OR NOT TO GO AWAY QUICKLY AS A RESULT OF IT THERE WILL BE

17:18 CONTINUED STRAIN.

17:19 THE PRESIDENTS PREDICTIVE POWERS WHETHER IT BE ON CEASE

17:22 FIRE'S OR RATE CUTS OR A LOT OF OTHER THINGS HASN'T BEEN REALLY

17:27 GOOD RECENTLY. A LOT OF THE STUFF IS

17:30 ASPIRATIONAL AND BECAUSE IT IS ASPIRATIONAL AND HOPEFUL I

17:33 THINK PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE TAKING IT TO THE BANK. ANNMARIE:

17:39 WE STARTED OFF TALKING ABOUT BIDEN'S POLL NUMBERS AND TODAY

17:43 IS CAN HAVE A LOT OF CAMPAIGN SPEAK.

17:45 THE POLLING NUMBERS SHOW PEOPLE ASSERTING TO FEEL BETTER ABOUT

17:48 THEIR PERSONAL FINANCES BUT THEY NOT GIVING BIDEN THE

17:49 CREDIT. IS THE TIMELINE ON HIS SIDE

17:53 AHEAD OF NOVEMBER?

17:54 >> SURE. BIDEN HAS GOT EIGHT MORE MONTHS

17:58 BEFORE THE ELECTION. THE BAD NEWS IS THE REST OF US

18:03 HAVE EIGHT MORE MONTHS BEFORE THE ELECTION.

18:09 WHAT YOU'VE GOT IS A NARRATIVE WITH TIME TO ADHERE AND SINK IN.

18:14 I THINK ON BALANCE THAT IS GOOD NEWS.

18:18 >> YOU RIGHT IN YOUR NOTE IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING WHEN IT

18:22 COMES TO THE BUDGET. ARE YOU PREPARED TO LEARN

18:25 ANYTHING WHEN HE RELEASES THIS BUDGET?

18:28 >> UNPREPARED TO LEARN WHAT IS POLITICAL PRIORITIES ARE AND

18:32 THAT'S ABOUT IT. ONE OF THE THINGS I SAID IN THE

18:38 NOTE IS IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME THE BUDGET DOES NOT MATTER,

18:40 LOOK AT THE CURRENT ROUNDABOUT SPENDING BILLS.

18:42 WHAT MATTERS IS SPENDING BILLS. THE BUDGET IS MEANT TO BE A

18:48 BROAD TOPLINE ASPIRATIONAL GOAL TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHAT

18:50 SHOULD BE. IN THE END NO ONE COULD BE ABLE

18:54 TO TELL YOU WHAT'S IN WASHINGTON.

18:58 THERE ARE FEW WHO CAN DO THIS. WITH THE RELATIONSHIP IS

19:01 BETWEEN A BUDGET PRIORITY AND WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND

19:05 WITH SPENDING. DEFENSE IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF

19:08 THAT. BIDEN SAID HE WANTS TO INCREASE

19:12 DEFENSE SPENDING 1%. HE SAID SOMETHING SIMILAR LAST

19:20 YEAR AND CONGRESS -- SAME THING WILL HAPPEN THIS YEAR.

19:24 >> IT'S A REASON A LOT OF PEOPLE NOT PAYING ATTENTION.

19:29 THEY ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO THINGS LIKE THE POTENTIAL

19:31 TIKTOK BAN THAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED.

19:33 RESONANT BIDEN SAYS HE WILL SIGN IT.

19:40 BLOOMBERG INTELLIGENCE THINKS THE REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATION

19:41 OR A REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATION WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO BAN IT

19:44 THAN THE CURRENT ONE. YOU AGREE? >> I THINK WHAT MATTERS THE

19:51 MOST IS HOW THE GOAL GETS DONE. WHEN YOU'VE GOT BIPARTISAN

19:58 AGREEMENT IN CONGRESS WITH THE 50-0 VOTE OUT OF COMMITTEE AND

20:02 MORE IMPORTANTLY YOU'VE HAD SENATE INTEL CHAIR MARK WARNER

20:07 WHOSE VERY RESPECTED AND NOBODY IS COUNTER MANNING HIM ON THIS

20:10 SAME TIKTOK ITSELF IS A NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT, WHAT

20:13 YOU'VE GOT HERE IS A WORLD IN WHICH SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE

20:15 SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT THIS

20:19 LAST YEAR.

20:25 I THINK THE PRESSURES TO DO SOMETHING BEFORE THE ELECTION

20:27 FRANKLY ARE GOING TO BE OVERWHELMING.

20:33 TIKTOK CONTINUES TO MAKE THIS WORSE ON THEMSELVES.

20:38 >> THE FORMER PRESIDENT, HE IS AGAINST THIS FOR SOME REASON.

20:42 DOES HE HAVE THE POTENTIAL POWER TO BLOW THIS UP?

20:44 >> HE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DO IT. TODAY I WOULD SAY THE BETTER

20:51 HALF OF THE ARGUMENT IS NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES.

20:56 THE PRESIDENT IS NOT TO COVER HIMSELF IN GLORY ON THIS.

21:02 YOU'VE GOT A SITUATION WHERE THE INTERESTING PART ABOUT THIS

21:05 IS YOU'VE GOT NOT ONLY THE FORMER PRESIDENT INVOLVED IN

21:09 THIS, YOU'VE ALSO GOT MAJOR REPUBLICAN PARTY BACKERS LIKE

21:13 THE CLUB FOR GROWTH INVOLVED IN SOME OF ITS MAJOR BACKERS

21:15 INVOLVED. THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A

21:17 FEEDBACK LOOP HERE. IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO

21:22 EMBARRASS A LOT OF PEOPLE IF FOR SOME REASON REPUBLICANS IN

21:25 CONGRESS TAKE THE VIEW THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE DOING

21:27 SOMETHING ABOUT TIKTOK.

21:29 >> DO YOU SEE SENATOR SCHUMER PUTTING IT ON THE FLOOR OF THE

21:36 SENATE?

21:37 >> HE WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

21:39 THE FIRST THING HE WILL DO IS AND GO -- ENGAGE IN

21:44 NEGOTIATIONS , PROBABLY APPOINT SENATOR WARNER OF VIRGINIA TO

21:47 DO THIS, TO TRY AND FIND A BIPARTISAN SOLUTION.

21:50 ONE THING SENATOR WARNER HAS SAID FOR EXAMPLE IS HE'S ALL

21:54 FOR BANNING TIKTOK BUT FOCUSING ON A SINGLE APP MAY PRESENT

21:58 SOME CONSTITUTIONAL PROBLEMS SO THE QUESTION OF HOW THIS WILL

22:01 GO OVER IN THE SENATE BEFORE PUTTING IT ON THE FLOOR.

22:07 >> IT'S NOT ABOUT TIKTOK OR THE ELECTION, WHEN ARE THEY GOING

22:08 TO BAN DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME? WHY HAVE THEY NOT TAKE AWAY

22:13 GIVEN THE FACT EVERYONE HATES IT.

22:16 >> I KNOW MY LIMITS AND THIS IS ONE OF THEM. IT IS INEXPLICABLE.

22:21 I DO ENJOY THE DARK. JONATHAN: TERRY HAINES, THANK YOU SIR.

22:31 LET'S TALK ABOUT TIKTOK JUST BRIEFLY.

22:33 ONE IS ABOUT THE CONTROL. AND OWNERSHIP OF U.S. DATA.

22:39 THE SECOND IS ROTTING THE MINDS OF AMERICAN CHILDREN.

22:44 THERE IS THIS I GUESSED PUSHBACK THAT IF WE ARE NOT

22:46 SOLVING EVERYTHING WE SHOULDN'T DO ANYTHING ON CAPITOL HILL AND

22:49 SOME PUSHBACK I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T SHARE. ANNMARIE:

22:55 WHAT WAS ASTONISHING WAS TRUMP REVERSAL ON THIS.

22:58 IT COMES AT A TIME AFTER HE MET WITH THE CLUB FOR GROWTH GROUP,

23:05 A HUGE DONOR ON THE SIDELINES FOR TRUMP AT THE MOMENT.

23:09 IF HE GETS INVOLVED IS THAT WHY POTENTIALLY PRESIDENT TRUMP IS

23:10 SAYING I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT TIKTOK. JONATHAN:

23:14 WE'VE ALL FORGOTTEN WHAT HAPPENED IN THE SUMMER OF 2020,

23:22 THERE WAS A DEAL STRUCK BETWEEN BYTEDANCE BACK IN THE SUMMER OF

23:24 2020 AND THEN IT DISAPPEARED. NO ONE TALKED ABOUT IN THE

23:27 MONTHS AFTERWARDS. BIDEN CAME IN AND DID NOT COME

23:30 BACK UP AGAIN. LISA: ORACLE IS REPORTING EARNINGS

23:36 AFTER THE BELL. I HADN'T EVEN REMEMBERED IT

23:40 WOULD LOOK BACK AND SAID WHY ISN'T ANYONE TALKING ABOUT THAT.

23:43 WHO PUSHED BACK? WHAT'S THE ANATOMY OF THE

23:44 FAILURE. YOU TALK ABOUT THE TWO THINGS

23:49 BOTH NATIONAL SECURITY AND THE ROTTING OF THE MINDS.

23:55 IF THEY REALLY HAVE NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS, THAT

23:57 SOMETHING THEY SHOULD EMPHASIZE AND THEY CAN REALLY IGNORE IF

23:58 THAT'S THE MAIN CONCERN. JONATHAN:

24:01 THAT'S ANOTHER REASON TO BE DESPISED BY WHAT HAPPENS IN

24:08 WASHINGTON DC.

24:09 >> PEOPLE WANTING TO CATER TO THE YOUTH VOTE.

24:12 IT SLIGHTLY ODD PRESIDENT SITS DOWN AND SAYS IF THEY PASS IT I

24:17 WILL SIGN IT AS HIS CAMPAIGN GETS TIKTOK READY.

24:21 I THINK EVERYONE KNOWS HOW I FEEL. EQUITY FUTURES DOWN BY ONE

24:24 QUARTER OF 1%. LOOKING AT DATA OUT OF CHINA

24:29 AND THE BIGGEST DATA POINT TO THE WEEK.

24:43 JONATHAN: PULLING BACK FROM ALL-TIME

24:47 HIGHS ON FRIDAY'S SESSION STARTING THE WEEK JUST SOUTH OF

24:48 THOSE LEVELS. WE ARE DOWN ONE QUARTER OF 1%

24:53 ON THE NASDAQ 100 AS WELL. WHILE SESSION FRIDAY FOR NVIDIA.

24:58 JUST ABOUT POSITIVE AND THE PREMARKET AFTER CLOSING FRIDAY

25:06 DOWN BY 5.5% POSITIVE BY ONE FULL PERCENTAGE POINT.

25:07 HERE'S THE BOND MARKET PICTURE FOR YOU.

25:10 LET'S SIT ON THE TWO-YEAR UPPER BASIS POINT.

25:13 ON A TWO YEAR YIELD. INSTEAD OF REINFORCING THE

25:19 STRENGTH OF THE JANUARY DATA I THINK THE PAYROLLS REPORT

25:20 INTRODUCING A BIGGER? OVER IT LOOKING AT SOME

25:24 ENTHUSIASM TO BUY BONDS AGAIN AND DRIVING YIELDS LOWER

25:29 THROUGH THE WEEK.

25:31 >> THE FACT OF THE WAGE INCREASE WAS LOWER THAN

25:36 EXPECTED.

25:37 AND THEN YOU HAVE THE LIKES OF RBC SAYING FADING TO QUOTE

25:41 WEAKNESS BECAUSE GUESS WHERE THE RISE NONEMPLOYMENT CAME

25:45 FROM. AT CERTAIN POINT TO ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE TRYING TO

25:50 LOOK NORTH OF TWO UNDER THOUSAND JOBS BEING CREATED

25:51 REALLY WEAK. THE DEBATE WILL CONTINUE.

25:53 >> BERKELEY SAYING MAYBE FADE SOME OF THE MOVE TO THE BOND

25:57 MARKET. A MOVE LOWER IN YIELDS ACROSS

26:00 THE CURVE.

26:03 >> I THINK ABOUT HOW ANY PEOPLE ARE PROBABLY CAN ADJOIN THAT

26:08 GIVEN THE FACT THERE IS A RISK WITH CPI AND QUITE A BIT OF

26:10 STRENGTH THROUGH NOT SEEING SOME SORT OF HUGE WAVE OF

26:15 LAYOFFS OR ANY SORT OF SIGN OF WEAKNESS JUST ISN'T AS HOT AS

26:16 IT COULD HAVE BEEN. JONATHAN:

26:19 LOOKING AT DOLLAR-YEN, NEGATIVE ON THIS CURRENCY FOR A FIFTH

26:24 STRAIGHT SESSION. I SAID BEFORE THE COMMERCIAL

26:28 BREAK THE BIGGEST DATA POINT OF THE WEEK PERHAPS NOT CPI.

26:31 MAYBE YOU'LL FIND IN JAPAN. THE LARGEST UNION ANNOUNCING

26:37 WAGE NEGOTIATION RESULTS AS A DATA POINT INFORMING CENTRAL

26:39 BANK DECISIONS, THAT MIGHT BE IT FOR THE WEEK. LISA:

26:44 A LOT OF OTHER UNIONS HAVE ALREADY NEGOTIATED WAGE

26:49 INCREASES GOING BACK TO 2011 HER EVEN MORE.

26:54 HOW MUCH DOES IT PUSH THEM TO RAISE RATES DO THEY PUSH IT

26:55 MORE POSITIVE.

27:03 >> THE START OF A CYCLE, THE FIRST SINCE 07.

27:05 ANOTHER MORNING OF YEN STRENGTH. OUR TOP STORIES INVESTORS

27:11 KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON DATA LOOKING FOR CLUES ON WHEN THE

27:12 FED MIGHT START CUTTING INTEREST RATES.

27:14 FOLLOWING THE MIXED PAYROLLS REPORT.

27:16 FEDERAL CPI OUT TOMORROW. RETAIL SALES ON THURSDAY.

27:22 EXPECTING TO HOLD INTEREST RATES STEADY FOR ITS FIFTH

27:24 CONSECUTIVE MEETING. NEXT WEEK IS ALL ABOUT THE

27:27 OUTLOOK. MOST OF THE READING OVER THE

27:33 WEEKEND SUGGESTING THEY WILL BE UNCHANGED RELATIVE TO WHAT WE

27:34 SAW IN DECEMBER.

27:39 >> IT HASN'T HAPPENED WITH RESPECT TO THE FEDS

27:41 EXPECTATIONS AND THE MARKET HAS COME TO WHAT THE FED HAS SAID.

27:47 HE CAME OUT AND SAID CPI IS NOW PRICED AS THE LARGEST RISK

27:48 EVENT IN MARCH. THAT THIS WILL BE A FED RESERVE

27:53 DEPENDENT ON THE MARCH 12 CPI AND IF IT COMES IN HOTTER THAN

27:57 EXPECTED, EXPECT SOME MORE DOUBTS RAISED ABOUT HOW QUICKLY

27:58 THEY CAN CUT RATES. ANNMARIE: LOOKING AT THE GAS PRICES FOR

28:02 REASON.

28:03 I HAVE TO SAY THAT WOULD BE INCREDIBLY INTERESTING AS

28:08 GASOLINE PRICES HAVE BEEN ON THE SIDE OF THIS ADMINISTRATION

28:12 GOING IN TO AN ELECTION AND IT'S BEEN THE JEWEL OF LOWER

28:14 INFLATION PRINTS TO HAVE THAT.

28:18 >> SHARING SOME OF THE ESTIMATES.

28:24 CPI TOMORROW, MONTH OVER MONTH LOOKING FOR 0.3%, IN PREVIOUS

28:28 MONTHS 0.4. PRESIDENT BIDEN TAKING ON

28:33 TIKTOK , A BIDEN SAYING HE WILL SUPPORT A QUICKLY MOVING

28:35 BIPARTISAN BILL TO BAN THE SOCIAL MEDIA BILL.

28:40 IT WOULD REQUIRED BYTEDANCE TO DIVESTED OR FACEUP BAN ON U.S.

28:44 APP STORES. IT CITES NATIONAL SECURITY

28:46 CONCERNS. TIKTOK IS PUSHBACK ON THOSE

28:48 ALLEGATIONS. WE ALL GET DRIVEN NUTS BY

28:52 POLITICIANS WEEK AFTER WEEK AND THIS ONE IS A MASSIVE

28:58 CONTRADICTION. SAYING THE PRESIDENT IF I PASS

29:02 IT I'LL SIGN IT AND OF THE SAME TIME SAYING I HAVE TO CAMPAIGN.

29:04 CAMPAIGNING ON TIKTOK SIMULTANEOUSLY. ANNMARIE:

29:07 SENATOR WARNER SAID HE IS UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THAT MIXED

29:12 MESSAGE. SAYING IT IS A MIXED MESSAGE

29:16 BUT THE PRESIDENT ALSO KNOWS THIS NEEDS TO GET THROUGH THE

29:19 HOUSE, THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT USING IT.

29:23 THEY FEEL THEY NEED TO GO OUT AND GET THAT YOUTH VOTE AND

29:26 HELP THEM IN -- BUT HELP THEM IN 2020.

29:31 >> I WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE ANATOMY OF THIS CONCERN WHICH

29:34 HAS BEEN PREVALENT FOR A LONG TIME. WHY DOES IT DIE AND GET

29:38 REGURGITATED?

29:42 >> EVERYONE SHOULD GO BACK TO THE STORIES OF SUMMER OF 2020.

29:46 SEPTEMBER 15 IT ALL STARTED IN AUGUST OF THAT YEAR.

29:49 IT WASN'T JUST THAT THE DEAL WENT TO ORACLE AND WALMART IT

29:53 WAS ALSO THAT THERE WAS THIS SPECIFIED AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU

29:55 HAD TO GIVE TO TREASURY TO GET THE DEAL. IT WAS ALL MOST LIKELY

30:00 COMMISSION FEE FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE WHITE HOUSE.

30:04 I THINK THE NUMBER IS ABOUT $5 BILLION.

30:05 IT WAS GOING TO THE TREASURY TO HELP EDUCATION OR SOMETHING

30:07 LIKE THAT. WHAT WAS WEIRD ABOUT IT IS WE

30:09 JUST MOVED ON. REALLY QUICKLY STOPPED TALKING

30:11 ABOUT IT. ANNMARIE: IT WAS HELD UP IN COURTS.

30:18 THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION CAME IN SAYING WE WILL DO OUR OWN

30:20 REVIEW OF IT AND NOW IT'S BEEN SITTING IN REVIEW WHILE

30:24 HARDLINERS IN CONGRESS SAID THEY WANT TO PICK UP A BILL

30:29 THAT WOULD GIVE THE PRESIDENT THE AUTHORITY WITHOUT HAVING TO

30:31 DEAL WITH POTENTIAL LEGAL PUSHBACK TO ACTUALLY BAN IT.

30:36 >> I'M NOT SURE WHAT I THINK OF THE FORMER PRESIDENT BUSINESS

30:38 MODEL THAT THE WHITE HOUSE COULD JUST BREAK UP COMPANIES

30:41 AND CHARGE COMMISSIONS TO AMERICAN COMPANIES TO BUY THEM.

30:43 IT WAS WEIRD THEN. LISA: WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT AGAIN.

30:51 JONATHAN: CPI RISING FOR THE FIRST TIME

30:53 SINCE AUGUST INCREASING FROM A YEAR AGO.

30:58 FALLING 2.7%, THE LONGEST STREAK OF DECLINE SINCE 2016.

31:02 THE ANNUAL NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS COMES TO A CLOSE IN

31:05 BEIJING. ENDA CURRAN JOINS US NOW FROM

31:07 D.C.. IT CAME FROM THIS SAYING IT WAS

31:12 A TARGET WITHOUT A PLAN. A GROWTH TARGET WITHOUT A PLAN.

31:16 DO THEY HAVE A PLAN? ENDA: THERE IS SKEPTICISM ON WHETHER

31:22 OR NOT THEY WILL GET WHAT THEY WANT THIS YEAR.

31:28 IF THE INFLATION IS COMING IN A 3% THE OBJECTIVE TARGETS.

31:33 OVER THE WEEKEND THAT'S ACTUALLY BEING PUT DOWN TO THE

31:40 LUNAR NEW YEAR HOLIDAY BECAUSE PEOPLE TRAVELED MORE, SPEND

31:44 MORE ON FOOD, TOURISM ROSE BY 23%.

31:47 A BAD WEATHER AFFECT AND A BASE AFFECT THERE AS WELL.

31:53 IF ASIA IS EXPECTED TO PULL OUT OF DEFLATION, AS YOU MENTIONED

31:56 IT'S GOOD TO BE A LOT OF THESE KEY TERMS, THE GROWTH TARGET,

32:00 THE INFLATION TARGET TO KEEP IN THE STRATEGY THEY'VE LAID OUT

32:02 FOR THE ECONOMY. THERE STILL A LOT OF PRESSURE

32:08 AND A LOT OF QUESTION MARKS ON WHETHER BEIJING HAS PLANS FOR

32:09 THE ECONOMY THIS YEAR.

32:13 >> THERE ARE ALSO QUESTIONS AROUND WHAT EXACTLY IS THE

32:17 STATE OF THE CHINESE ECONOMY BECAUSE WE SEE CONSUMER

32:20 SPENDING PICKING UP WHEN IT COMES TO CERTAIN THINGS LIKE

32:21 RESTAURANTS OR EVEN TRAVEL. AND YET IT'S FALLING THE MOST

32:25 SINCE 20. THE LOWEST SINCE AUGUST AND WE

32:29 SEEN THE STOCKPILES INCREASED DRAMATICALLY IN CHINA. ENDA:

32:33 IRON ORE IS A FASCINATING ONE TO WATCH.

32:38 I THINK IT SURPRISE MOST PEOPLE LAST YEAR DESPITE THE MOOD

32:41 MUSIC ON CHINA'S ECONOMY. WE HAVE LANGUAGE OVER THE

32:45 WEEKEND REPEATEDLY POINTING OUT HOUSES ARE FOR LIVING IN NOT

32:46 FOR SPECULATING. GOING TOWARDS THE IDEA OF A

32:51 RAPID SURGE.

32:52 I THINK AS WE ARE SEEING THIS THEIR SIGNIFICANT QUESTION

32:57 MARKS AROUND WHERE CHINA’'S ECONOMY WILL GO.

33:00 THEY HAVE SET A GROWTH TARGET OF 5%.

33:03 THEY DON'T HAVE A FAVORABLE BASE AFFECT AND THE TARGETS

33:06 THEY'VE SET OUT SUGGESTING INCREASE.

33:08 IT'S GOT A LONG WAY TO GO. I THINK MOST PEOPLE WOULD AGREE

33:13 IT'S NOT WHERE IT COULD BE AND NOT WHERE IT WAS BACK IN THE

33:15 DECADE WE JUST LEFT.

33:22 WE HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE HOUSING MARKET AND SEE WHAT

33:25 THEY DO THEIR WHEN AND IF THEY CAN TURN THAT AROUND.

33:28 AND IF THAT TURNS AROUND THAT WILL DRIVE THE REST OF THE

33:29 CHINA ECONOMY STORY.

33:33 >> I'M STRUGGLING WITH WHAT THEY SAID OVER MAY XI JINPING

33:36 DOES NOT CARE IF HE DOESN'T HIT THE TARGET AND MAYBE HE DOES

33:41 NOT CARE IF THERE ISN'T MORE STRENGTH BECAUSE THE GOALS ARE

33:43 ELSEWHERE OTHER THAN JUST SUPPORTING THE ECONOMY.

33:47 DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT THAT IT'S ESSENTIALLY NO LONGER A

33:51 PRIORITY TO KEEP THE ECONOMY WARRING -- ROARING?

33:59 ENDA: YOU CAN LOOK AT IT BOTH WAYS.

34:06 THEY ARE NOT ADVOCATING THE GO-GO YEARS WE'VE GOT USE OF

34:07 RAPID GROWTH IN CHINA. THEY WANT SUSTAINABLE GROWTH.

34:14 WITHIN THAT THEY ARE TALKING A LOT ABOUT INNOVATION,

34:17 TECHNOLOGY , HIGH-QUALITY GROWTH WAS ONE OF THE PHRASES

34:19 THAT CAME OUT. AT THE SAME TIME IF THEY SET A

34:25 GROWTH TARGET OF 5%, AUTHORITIES IN BEIJING WILL

34:27 WANT TO COME PRETTY CLOSE.

34:33 BARRING SOME KIND OF EMERGENCY DURING THE PANDEMIC FOR EXAMPLE.

34:35 BOTH CAN BE CORRECT. THEY HAVE TOP PRIORITIES THERE.

34:43 SECURITY, TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT, INNOVATION IS

34:45 PROBABLY NUMBER ONE ON THE LIST BUT THE SAME TIME GROWING THE

34:49 ECONOMY AND ENSURING CONSUMPTION OF WEALTH IS

34:50 INCREASING IS ALSO IMPORTANT. THERE IS STILL AN EXPECTATION

34:54 THE GOVERNMENT WILL COME PRETTY CLOSE TO THE TARGET WHEN IT'S

34:57 OPEN AT THE END OF THE YEAR.

35:01 >> THE CHINESE LEGISLATOR TIGHTENING THE GRIP IN CHINA

35:06 FOR THINGS LIKE -- DOES THAT HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY?

35:11 >> AND OUTSIDE LOOKING IN VIEW PEOPLE WORRYING ABOUT AN

35:16 ECONOMY PROSPER AND THRIVE WHEN YOU HAVE THIS LEVEL OF

35:22 DOCTRINAIRE CONTROL IN ALL ASPECTS OF HOW DECISIONS ARE

35:24 MADE, HOW COMPANIES OPERATE. THIS IS A SOURCE OF CRITICISM.

35:29 YOU'VE HEARD BUSINESSPEOPLE PEOPLE MAKE THE POINT THAT

35:32 CHINA FLOURISHED WHEN THEY STEPPED BACK IN THOSE YEARS AND

35:36 ALLOWED INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY AND HOMEGROWN

35:39 TECHNOLOGY TO GET OFF THE GROUND.

35:41 NOW THE PARTY IS INTERVENING IN EVERYTHING.

35:46 THIS GOES TO THE IDEA CHINA'S ECONOMY IS OUTPUTTING NATIONAL

35:48 SECURITY FRONT AND CENTER.

35:55 WANTING TO GET THE KEY PARTS OF THE ECONOMY INTEREST IN PLACE

35:59 BECAUSE THEY'RE IN A STRATEGIC RACE WITH THE U.S..

36:03 SO OF COURSE WITH CRITICISM OF THE ROLE THEY ARE PLAYING AND

36:06 CHINA PUSHES BACK WITH STRATEGIC NATIONAL INTEREST.

36:11 ANNMARIE: THERE'S BEEN NO PRESS CONFERENCE AND WE'VE SEEN THEM

36:13 TAKE A TIGHTER GRIP ON THE GOVERNMENT.

36:16 WHAT MESSAGE IS THIS GOING TO SEND TO FOREIGN INVESTORS? ENDA:

36:22 I THINK THE PRESS CONFERENCE DEFINITELY WAS A NEGATIVE LOOK

36:27 FOR FOREIGN INVESTORS. BUT THERE'S NO DOUBT THE

36:31 HIGHLIGHT EVERY YEAR WAS SPEAKING TO REPORTERS NOT ONLY

36:37 SPEAKING TO THE WORLD AND ADD -- GIVE SOME CLUE FOR WHAT

36:41 ECONOMIC POLICY WAS, NONETHELESS, ONE OF THE FEW

36:44 OPPORTUNITIES TO QUESTION ONE OF THE TOP LEADERS OF CHINA AND

36:46 WHEN THEY PULL BACK FROM DOING THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF

36:49 EVERYTHING WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, SEEING THOSE

36:54 RAIDS ON FOREIGN BUSINESS AND ONGOING CONTROL OF THE PARTY

36:55 AND BUSINESS IN BUSINESS AND THE ECONOMY.

36:59 GIVEN THE CONTEXT OF FOREIGN INVESTORS WITHIN CHINA IS

37:02 ALREADY SO LOW IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T HELP THAT.

37:10 WE SEE WITH PORTFOLIO FLOWS, I THINK THE FOREIGN WORLD REMAINS

37:12 TO BE CONVINCED ON THE CHINESE ECONOMY AT THE MOMENT. JONATHAN:

37:16 THANK YOU SIR RATES STARTED THIS BY TALKING OUT ABOUT NO

37:19 NEWS BEING GOOD NEWS STATESIDE. LOOKING AT THE HEADLINES WE SAW

37:24 THIS MORNING IN THE POLICY MARKET. LISA:

37:26 EVERYONE WAS LOOKING AT STIMULUS WAITING FOR THE

37:29 BAZOOKA TO BE COMING IN. SOME ADDITIONAL STIMULUS AROUND

37:32 THE MARGINS. PEOPLE ARE SAYING SHOW US THE

37:34 MONEY. JONATHAN: THAT BIG RED HEADLINE ACROSS

37:42 THE BLOOMBERG, GETTING HIT HARD. THE STORY IN CHINA LET'S

37:44 SCHEDULE AN UPDATE ELSEWHERE. LET'S GET TO YOUR BLOOMBERG

37:46 BRIEF. INVESTORS ARE SEEKING TO RAISE

37:52 AS MUCH AS A QUARTER OF A BILLION DOLLARS IN WHAT WOULD

37:54 BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST IPO'S SO FAR THIS YEAR.

37:59 THE COMPANY PLANS TO OFFER 22 MILLION SHARES IN THE IPO PRICE

38:02 BETWEEN $31 AND $34 EACH. READ IT IS SEEKING A LISTING ON

38:08 THE NEW YORK STOCK TICK -- REFFIT SEEKING A LISTING ON THE

38:15 NEAT -- REDDIYT SEEKING A LISTING ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE.

38:17 THE BOEING COULD BE PUSHED OUT TO 2027 IS THE PLAYMAKER

38:21 UNDERGOES CRIMINAL REVIEWS.

38:27 DELTA CEO SAID IT EXPECTED TO RECEIVE THE AIRCRAFT AS SOON AS

38:29 NEXT YEAR IT IS NOW ANTICIPATING DELAYS.

38:34 THEY HAVE ORDERS FOR 110 PLANES AND OPTIONS TO PURCHASE 30 MORE.

38:40 OPPENHEIMER PICKED UP A TOTAL OF SEVEN ACADEMY AWARDS

38:41 INCLUDING BEST PICTURE AND BEST DIRECTOR FOR CHRISTOPHER NOLAN.

38:45 BARBIE'S EIGHT NOMINATIONS AMOUNTED FOR ONE TROPHY FOR

38:47 BEST SONG.

38:54 DISNEY'S "POOR THINGS" WINNING FOUR AWARDS INCLUDING

39:00 BEST ACTRESS LILY GLAD -- INCLUDING BEST ACTRESS.

39:01 LILY GLADSTONE WAS SET TO BECOME THE FIRST NATIVE

39:07 AMERICAN WOMEN -- WOMAN TO WIN ASKED ACTRESS FOR HER ROLE IN

39:09 "KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON." LISA:

39:20 A MOVIE THAT COULD -- THE WORLDS COULD POTENTIALLY DEAL

39:21 WITH THE CONSEQUENCES FOR A LONG TIME. JONATHAN:

39:26 DO YOU WANT TO REVIEW FOR THE WEEKEND? "DUNE 2"

39:29 WAS PRETTY DECENT. ANNMARIE: DID YOU FINISH THE FIRST ONE?

39:34 JONATHAN: I GOT THROUGH MOST OF IT BEFORE

39:36 WALKING OUT OF THE CINEMA BEFORE IT FINISHED. "DUNE 2"

39:41 WAS WORTH THE WATCH.

39:47 UP NEXT ON THE PROGRAM, THE CASE AGAINST DATA DEPENDENCY.

39:52 >> DO WE WANT TO REALLY DRIVE AND LOOK IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR.

39:55 OF COURSE NOT. THAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH BEING

40:00 OVERLY DATA-DEPENDENT? JONATHAN: THAT CONVERSATION COMING UP

40:04 NEXT. ♪

40:25 JONATHAN: LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY.

40:29 STOCKS DOWN LOWER ON THE S&P 500.

40:33 A QUICK SNAPSHOT OF THE BOND MARKET UNCHANGED ON A 10 YEAR

40:38 YIELD.

40:39 FOUR POINT 0788. THE CASE AGAINST DATA

40:40 DEPENDENCY.

40:44 >> YOU HAVE EXCESSIVE DATA DEPENDENCY.

40:51 TWO FOR THE FED, IT HAS TOOLS TO OPERATE THROUGH THE LAG.

40:55 DO WE WANT TO DRIVE A CAR LOOKING AT THE REARVIEW MIRROR

40:59 WITH A MAP THAT MAY BE COMPLETELY REVISED?

41:01 OF COURSE NOT. THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH BEING

41:03 OVERLY DATA DEPENDENT. WITHOUT THAT STRATEGIC VIEW,

41:08 THAT DATA IS TAKEN ON A ROLLER COASTER. JONATHAN:

41:12 HERE'S THE LATEST THIS MORNING. BUILDING AFTER THE FEDERAL --

41:17 FEBRUARY PAYROLLS WITH MORE DATA ON DECK.

41:21 RETAIL SALES ON THURSDAY. THE LOWER YEAR ON YEAR

41:27 INFLATION SHOULD KEEP FED OFFICIALS ON TRACK TO BEGIN

41:29 CUTTING RATES IN JUNE. A CUT IN MAY AS POSSIBLE BUT

41:33 ONLY IF CPI COMES IN WEAKER THAN EXPECTED.

41:36 ANDREW JOINS US NOW FOR MORE. GOOD MORNING.

41:40 WHAT DID YOU PICK UP ON THE LINE?

41:45 HOW DEPENDABLE IS THE ECONOMIC DATA WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE

41:46 DEPENDENT ON ALL OF IT.

41:50 >> WE ARE ON THAT ROLLER COASTER HE IS TALKING ABOUT.

41:54 275 THOUSAND NEW JOBS. STRONG JOBS NUMBER FOR THE

41:56 MONTH OF FEBRUARY. YOU LOOK BACK AND YOU WOULD

42:01 167,000 JOBS WE THOUGHT WERE THERE THAT ARE NO LONGER THERE.

42:04 I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY AN EXAMPLE OF THE PROBLEM OF TYING

42:07 YOURSELF TOO CLOSELY TO THE DATA.

42:14 WHAT IS IT ABOUT NOW THAT INSPIRES CONFIDENCE BUT

42:16 ULTIMATELY INFORMS THIS IDEA WE WILL ROLL PRETTY SOON.

42:23 >> 275,000 JOBS, THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN LOOK AT IT AND SAY

42:26 THAT'S NOT A STRONG JOBS MARKET. IT IS.

42:32 THE ISSUE IS THE TRENDS YOU ARE SEEING AND THAT'S WHAT WE DO AS

42:35 ECONOMISTS IS LOOK AT THE TREND AND FIGURE OUT WHERE THAT'S

42:36 GOING. DATA HAD BEEN MIXED WHICH SHOWED WE WERE GOING INTO THIS

42:38 TRANSITION. 3.9% UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS LOW

42:44 BUT IT IS UP 0.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS OFF THE LOW.

42:47 WHEN YOU HAVE THIS SLOWING OF THE JOB MARKET WE HAVE SEEN

42:52 HISTORICALLY IT IS VERY HARD FOR THAT NOT TO DEVELOP INTO A

42:57 MORE SIGNIFICANT SLOWDOWN SO THAT'S WHAT KEEPS US THINKING

42:58 THIS WILL BE CONFIRMED LATER THIS YEAR. LISA:

43:02 WHAT IS THE FED'S ROLE IN THIS. YOU'VE BEEN OUT FRONT SAYING

43:06 THERE'S MORE STRENGTH IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR THEN

43:08 PEOPLE ARE EXPECTING A NOBLE FORCE THE FED TO CUT MORE

43:10 AGGRESSIVELY LATER IN THE YEAR. DO YOU THINK BY NOT CUTTING

43:17 RATES THEY WILL ESSENTIALLY FRONT -- CARRY FORWARD SOME OF

43:18 THE WEAKER GROWTH YOU EXPECT LATER? ANDREW:

43:23 WE ARE IN A SCENARIO WE HAVEN'T EXPERIENCED IN A DECADE.

43:27 WE HAVE INFLATION ABOVE TARGET AND WE WILL HAVE THE SURGE IN

43:31 WEAKNESS AND THEN YOU HAVE TO ASK THE QUESTION ARE YOU

43:36 RESPONDING TO THE INFLATION MANDATE, RESPONDING TO THE

43:37 EMPLOYMENT MANDATE? I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE IS A

43:43 RIGHT OR WRONG ANSWER FOR THE FED HERE.

43:45 I THINK THEY'RE SEEING ENOUGH OF THOSE READINGS.

43:52 >> JUERGEN -- YOUR COMPATRIOT STUART KAISER TALKING ABOUT CPI.

43:56 SOME EXPECTING IT TO BE HOTTER THAN EXPECTED TO THE FACT

43:59 YOU'VE SEEN GASOLINE PRICES INCREASING PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY.

44:03 HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD REALLY COLOR THEIR VIEW?

44:07 >> I'M INTERESTED IN THOSE GASOLINE PRICES ALSO.

44:12 WE'VE SEEN CONSUMERS THAT ARE MORE POSITIVE ON THE ECONOMY.

44:15 PART OF THAT IS PROBABLY GASOLINE PRICES THAT HAVE COME

44:16 DOWN.

44:22 ON THE INFLATION REPORT ITSELF AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE FED?

44:28 WE ARE PROJECTING 0.33% ON THE CPI INFLATION AND THAT'S

44:32 FOLLOWING 0.39% MONTH ON MONTH CORE CPI AND THOSE ARE SOMEWHAT

44:35 UNCOMFORTABLE READINGS IF WHAT YOU ARE TELLING THE AMERICAN

44:40 PUBLIC IS WE ARE COMING BACK TO 2% INFLATION BECAUSE IT'S JUST

44:42 NOT 2% INFLATION. IF YOU LOOK AT CORE PCE

44:46 INFLATION THAT WAS RUNNING ABOVE 3% AND WILL KEEP COMING

44:50 DOWN. THAT SHOULD BE RUNNING MORE

44:52 LIKE 2.5%. I THINK THAT KEEPS THEM ON

44:57 TRACK TO CUT RATES BUT HAVE WE REALLY DEFEATED INFLATION?

45:00 ANNMARIE: WHAT WOULD YOU NEED TO SEE FOR

45:02 A CUT IN MAY? ANDREW: ONE WOULD BE THIS CORE

45:08 INFLATION COMING IN AT 0.33. LET'S SAY IT COMES IN AT 0.20.

45:17 WE REALLY SLOWDOWN ON THIS MONTH'S PRINT.

45:20 THAT WOULD AT LEAST PUT MAY OR SOLIDLY ON THE TABLE.

45:24 YOU PROBABLY ALSO NEED SOME KIND OF ACTIVITY DATA.

45:26 2070 5000 PAYROLLS. WE THINK RETAIL SALES WILL BE

45:30 STRONG THIS WEEK. LET'S A RETAIL SALES IS WEAKER.

45:34 MAY BE A SOFTER INFLATION REPORT.

45:37 THAT COULD BECOME A REALITY. JONATHAN:

45:41 WHY WILL RATE CUTS HELP PICK THINGS UP IN THE FACE OF

45:42 ADVERSE DATA? THE GOVERNOR SAID WHAT'S THE

45:47 RUSH. THIS ANY OF THAT RESONATE WITH

45:48 YOU?

45:53 >> IT'S GETTING AT THIS NOTION OF WHERE IS THE NEUTRAL RATE OF

45:55 INTEREST WHERE WE HAVE POLICY RATES RELATIVE TO INTEREST AND

45:59 I THINK IT'S JUST REALLY HARD TO ASSESS IN THIS ENVIRONMENT

46:02 BECAUSE WE HAD INCREDIBLE FISCAL STIMULUS INTO THE

46:07 ECONOMY SO IT COULD BE INTEREST RATES HAVE THE SLOWING EFFECT

46:11 ON THE ECONOMY IT WAS OFFSET BY THE FISCAL EFFECT OF STIMULUS

46:14 SO HOW DO YOU DISENTANGLE THOSE TWO? WE DO KNOW CLEARLY WITH THE

46:19 HOUSING MARKET IF YOU RAISE INTEREST RATES YOU SLOWDOWN THE

46:20 HOUSING MARKET. THAT'S WHAT I WOULD BE REALLY

46:27 LOOKING FORWARD TO IN TERMS OF DATA OR A SENSITIVITY TO

46:28 INTEREST RATES? LISA: THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT

46:32 URGENCY. IF WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE IMMEDIATE EFFECTS, WHAT WOULD

46:37 IT MATTER IF THEY CUT 25 BASIS POINTS NOW IN -- VERSUS IN JUNE

46:41 OR OCTOBER? ANDREW: YOU WANT TO HAVE A STRATEGY AND

46:47 FRAMEWORK FOR HOW YOU ARE PURSUING THESE RATE CUTS OR

46:48 INTEREST-RATE POLICY IN GENERAL. WITH THE ECONOMY WILL RESPOND

46:54 TO , THIS VERY LITTLE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY.

46:56 WHERE IS THE 10 YEAR TREASURY. WHERE DO INDIVIDUALS BORROW FOR

47:00 A 30 YEAR MORTGAGE. THE CORPORATE SBARRO?

47:05 THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE CONTROLLING AND THAT'S GOOD TO BE DEPENDENT

47:08 ON MARKETS OVER TIME. THAT IS WHAT'S FILLED UP BY

47:15 YOUR REACTION FUNCTION BY YOUR STRATEGY SO THIS WHOLE

47:20 DISCUSSION DO YOU CUT IN MAY OR JUNE OR JULY, THE TIMING OF

47:23 THAT RATE CUT I THINK FED OFFICIALS ARE RIGHT, IT DOES

47:24 NOT REALLY MATTER. JONATHAN: JUST GOT A GREAT QUESTION FROM

47:29 A BLOOMBERG SUBSCRIBER ON THE TERMINAL.

47:31 IT'S RELATED TO MARKETS BUT EQUITY MARKETS.

47:34 MAYBE SOME MORE SPECULATIVE LIKE ASSETS ELSEWHERE IN THE

47:37 FINANCIAL MARKET. IS THE FED TO BE CONCERNED

47:39 ABOUT THAT? ARE WE AT THE POINT WHERE THIS

47:42 BECOMES A FINANCIAL STABILITY CONCERN.

47:44 ARE WE NEAR THOSE CONCERNS.

47:50 ANDREW: ULTIMATELY ITS OVERALL FINANCIAL CONDITIONS OF THE

47:52 FEED INTO THE ECONOMY. WHEN YOU SEE VARIOUS ASSETS,

47:59 SOME OF THE RISKIER ONES AT ALL-TIME HIGHS THERE SHOULD BE

48:04 AN INDICATION A SIGNIFICANT LOOSENING OF FINANCIAL

48:06 CONDITION SINCE THAT. PERIOD WE TALKED ABOUT.

48:12 THIS IS SOMETHING THE FED HAS PARTIALLY ENGINEERED THROUGH

48:15 THEIR POLICY SO IT SHOULD BE AN INPUT. JONATHAN:

48:19 STOCKS HAVE RIPPED SINCE THE END OF OCTOBER AND HAVE NOT

48:20 STOPPED RIPPING.

48:27 >> SORT OF THE KEY POSTER CHILD WHERE BITCOIN IS SURGING TO

48:28 RECORD HIGHS. AT WHAT POINT DOES THIS MATTER

48:33 AT A TIME WHEN PEOPLE ARE SAYING THIS IS EASING FINANCIAL

48:35 CONDITIONS AND PUSHING THE FED AWAY FROM THEIR TARGET.

48:37 THEY DON'T SEEM TO CARE?

48:42 >> SAID LAST WEEK, THEY ASKED THE QUESTION WILL THEY REDUCE

48:45 INTEREST RATES WITH EQUITIES AT ALL-TIME HIGHS AND CREDIT

48:48 SPREADS, WE WILL SEE PRAYED IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

48:51 ANDREW GOING INTO THE DATA LATER THIS WEEK.

48:54 A COUPLE DAYS LATER WE WILL GET RETAIL SALES.

49:00 COMING UP ON THIS PROGRAM, PRINCIPAL ASSET MANAGEMENT,

49:01 HENRIETTA OF VEDA PARTNERS. KRISHNA OF LAFAYETTE JOINING US

49:09 WITH EQUITY FUTURES NEGATIVE BY .1% ON THE S&P 500.

49:14 FOLLOWING LAST WEEK'S VERY MILD MARGINAL PULLBACK ON A WEEKLY

49:15 BASIS ON THE ECB. FROM NEW YORK CITY THIS IS

49:18 BLOOMBERG. ♪

49:48 YOU'LL HAVE MORE OF THE SAME, STRONGER GROWTH, SLOWER

49:52 INFLATION. BAD NEWS IS PROBABLY GOOD NEWS

49:55 BECAUSE IT WILL ACCELERATE RATE CUTS. WE ARE VERY MUCH IN A SOFT

49:57 LANDING. THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE

50:02 WITH JONATHAN FERRO, LISA ABRAMOWICZ AND ANNMARIE HORDERN.

50:06 JONATHAN: LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY THIS

50:11 MORNING, GOOD MORNING FOR OUR AUDIENCE WORLDWIDE THIS IS

50:12 BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE. YOUR EQUITY MARKET BASICALLY

50:17 UNCHANGED LIKE IT WAS LAST WEEK, DOWN BY A QUARTER OF 1%.

50:25 A MASSIVE WEEK FOR DATA, INFORMING FEDERAL RESERVE

50:28 DECISIONS NEXT WEEK. CPI AROUND THE CORNER. LISA:

50:34 GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE GOT A JOB NUMBER THAT WAS HOTTER THAN

50:39 EXPECTED, THE QUESTION NOW IS, DOES THIS COME WITH INFLATION

50:43 OR NOT? ULTIMATELY KAISER SAYING THIS

50:45 WILL BE THE KEY POINT FROM THE FINAL RESERVE TO WILL GUIDE THE

50:49 MARKET TO. JONATHAN: THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF WILL TELL

50:57 YOU WHEN THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL REACT. SOMETIME SOON.

51:02 ANNMARIE: THAT LITTLE OUTFIT IS WHAT THE

51:05 PRESIDENT CALLED THE FEDERAL RESERVE HE BET

51:11 THE CUTS WILL BE COMING.

51:17 THIS COULD BE SOMETHING THAT HURTS THIS ADMINISTRATION IF WE

51:21 SEE GASOLINE COME IN HIGHER-THAN-EXPECTED EVEN GOING

51:27 INTO THE SUMMER, PETE DRIVING EAK DRIVING SEASON. LISA:

51:37 THE FED IS GOING TO CUT ANYWAY. JONATHAN:

51:41 SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS CONTROVERSIAL AND I THOUGHT IT

51:42 WAS A BIT SILLY. LISA:

51:48 WHAT IS SEEN DRIVING AT, CALLING THEM A LITTLE OUTFIT?

51:50 I'M NOT WANT TO SEEM POLITICAL. ANNMARIE:

51:58 WE HAVE SEEN HIM LEAN INTO THE HOUSING MARKET.

52:04 HE IS TRYING TO GIVE REBATES TO INDIVIDUALS TO TRY TO GET ON

52:08 THE PROPERTY LADDER AND CUTTING THOSE INTEREST FEES INTO THAT

52:09 THEME. THIS FEEDS INTO THE ELIZABETH

52:13 WARREN CAP OF THE PARTY. JONATHAN:

52:21 FROM A SUPPLY-SIDE, THEY ARE UNLOCKING THE SILOS. LISA:

52:26 YOU'RE LOOKING OVER AT ME AND TRYING TO WIND ME OUT.

52:33 YOU NEED TO HAVE A MARKET BEFORE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT

52:35 THE PRICING IS AND I UNDERSTAND PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF ARE NOT

52:39 GOING TO SELL UNTIL THEY CAN BUY SOMETHING ELSE WITH THE

52:40 MORTGAGE RATE THAT MAKES SENSE. ANNMARIE:

52:45 PRESIDENT BIDEN WANTS TO GET PEOPLE LIKE YOU A TAX CREDIT

52:46 FOR SELLING YOUR HOMES. JONATHAN:

52:50 YOU WANT TO SELL YOUR HOUSE?

52:57 EQUITIES ON THE S&P 500 NEGATIVE .5 PERCENT.

52:58 IT'S A SMALL PULLBACK.

53:05 CAN WE THROW UP IN VIDEO, --

53:11 NVIDIA UP .02% FRIDAY SESSION WAS ODD, CLOSED AT -5.5%. LISA:

53:20 WHAT I FIND INTERESTING OVERNIGHT YOU LOOK AT THE

53:24 GYRATION IN NVIDIA STOCK, 300 BILLION OF MARKET CAP WIPED OUT

53:27 AND BROUGHT BACK.

53:29 IT RAISES THE QUESTION, WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

53:36 DOES IT INDICATED TOPPING OUT? JONATHAN:

53:40 THAT HAS TO BE THE BIGGEST ONE DAY CAP OUT FOR NO REASON. LISA:

53:44 AND NO ONE SEEMS TO CARE ABOUT IT ALL.

53:49 WE ARE TALKING BIG NUMBERS, A THIRD OF THE S&P'S PERFORMANCE

53:52 TIED UP WITH NVIDIA'S PERFORMANCE.

53:58 AS WYATT WON TO SEE ORACLE'S EARNINGS, HOW MUCH MONEY OUR

54:03 COMPANIES PUTTING INTO TECH INVESTMENT? JONATHAN:

54:10 IN WITH PREMARKET POSITIVE AT 1.2%.

54:18 COMING UP THIS MORNING, SEEMA SHAH AND KRISHNA HEMNAMI ON WHY

54:25 THE TIME TO BUY T-BILLS IS NOW. CPI, PPI, RETAIL SALES ALL

54:31 AHEAD OF NEXT WEEK'S FEDS DECISION.

54:37 EQUITIES WILL LIKELY SEE VOLATILITY AHEAD OF ONE AGE

54:40 FOLLOWED BY RENEWED RALLY IN THE SECOND AS RATE CUTS FINALLY

54:45 BEGAN, SMALL-CAP STOCKS AND NARROW THE VALUATION GAP WITH

54:47 LARGE CAP. IT IS GOOD TO SEE YOU WELCOME

54:52 STATESIDE. LET'S GET INTO THAT CALL, AS

54:58 IT'S STILL EARLY TO BUY SMALL CAPS STILL?

55:04 SEEMA: AS LONG AS YOU HAVE A DEBATE

55:07 GOING ON WITH RATE CUTS AND TIMING THINGS WILL BE DIFFICULT.

55:10 ONCE YOU GET CLOSER YOU COULD REALLY SEE RATE CUTS IN LINE OF

55:15 SIGHT AND IS BACKED UP BY A SOLID ECONOMY SLOWING BUT SOLID

55:18 AND THAT SHOULD BE THE GREEN LIGHT. JONATHAN:

55:24 WHAT ARE YOU LEAVING BEHIND, LARGE CAP TECH? SEEMA:

55:27 WERE NOT TRYING TO TAKE AWAY FROM LARGE CAP, WE ARE ADDING

55:31 TO THE U.S. AT THE MOMENT.

55:37 I THINK IT'S A RARE PERSON TO SAY VALUATIONS ARE EXPENSIVE

55:39 FOR LARGE STACK BUT WE ARE LOOKING AT TECH OVER THE

55:44 LONG-TERM HORIZON AND IF THERE'S ANY PULLBACK WE ARE NOT

55:48 LOOKING TO TAKE AWAY. IT WILL CREATE A LITTLE MORE

55:52 MOVEMENT IN THE SMALL-CAP SPACE. LISA:

55:56 TAKING AWAY FROM A COUPLE OF REGIONS, ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT

56:02 EUROPE? SEEMA: YES. LISA: WHY?

56:05 SEEMA: VALUATIONS CONTINUE TO LOOK

56:06 ATTRACTIVE, THAT'S NOT A NEW STORY. IT IS A VALUE TRAP.

56:15 FUNDAMENTALS HAVE TO BE IN LINE WITH THEIR VALUATIONS AND THEY

56:18 DON'T LOOK LIKE THEY ARE VERY PROMISING FOR THIS YEAR.

56:25 THERE ARE OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD TO REACH OUT TO, LATIN

56:31 AMERICA, INDIA, JAPAN WITH SOME AMBIGUITY ADDED TO THAT.

56:33 EUROPE IS NOT THE AREA WE ARE FIXED ON. LISA:

56:36 I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE SPLINTERING IN THE MAG SEVEN.

56:44 DO YOU AGREE WE CAN SEE PARITY ON THE EURO AND NOT THE DOLLAR

56:49 BECAUSE THERE'S THIS DISSIDENTS NOT RECOGNIZED BY MARKETS YET?

56:53 SEEMA: I THINK THE ECB HAS TO MOVE

56:54 EITHER WAY.

57:00 I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO CUT RATES, IDEALLY SOMETIME IN LINE

57:03 WITH THE FED BUT IF THE FED IS NOT MOVING, THE ECB HAS TO GO

57:07 BECAUSE THEY HAVE A DIFFICULT STORY AHEAD OF THEM.

57:13 IT DOES PULL APART THE EURO IN THE DOLLAR.

57:14 I WONDER HOW AGGRESSIVE THE ECB CAN BE.

57:18 THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE MORE AGGRESSIVE AND THEY CAN ONLY BE

57:19 MORE AGGRESSIVE AT THE FED IS CUTTING. JONATHAN:

57:25 YOU THINK THE FED AFFECTS THE SCALE OF EC BECAUSE? LISA:

57:30 WE KNOW IT'S TYPICALLY HAWKISH. I DON'T THINK IT DRIVES HER

57:34 DECISION-MAKING BUT COMES INTO CONSIDERATION.

57:38 THEY WILL NEVER SAY THAT, OF COURSE.

57:40 BUT AT THE BACK OF THEIR MIND IS A PLAY.

57:46 JONATHAN: THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT PARITY

57:53 AND LISA MENTIONED IF WE GET A PARITY MOVE, HOW DOES THAT

57:55 INFLUENCE THE INFLATION STORY IN THE EURO ZONE? SEEMA:

58:00 IT'S REALLY COME TO HELP THE EXPORT SIDE OF THE ECONOMY, THE

58:03 MANUFACTURING SIDE OF THE ECONOMY.

58:07 FOR A COUNTRY LIKE GERMANY WHICH HAS STAGNATION WRITTEN

58:09 ALL OVER IT, IT COULD DO WITH ANY HELP IT CAN GET.

58:15 THE CURRENCY, IT SLIGHTLY ON THE INFLATION SIDE OF BED.

58:19 THAT'S PROBABLY WHY THE ECB WILL GO LONGER THAN THEY WOULD

58:25 LIKE TO BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO STEM AND I'LL THINK OF RATES.

58:27 LISA: WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DIGEST

58:34 THE MOVES THAT APPLE, TESLA AND THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THAT

58:37 WILL AFFECT THE REST OF THE COMPLEX.

58:41 HOW DO YOU STAY CONFIDENT AND NAMES THAT HAVE RALLIED

58:42 DRAMATICALLY AND SHOWING SIGNS OF EXHAUSTION? SEEMA:

58:48 WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE EARNINGS STORY AND WE LOOK AT THE LONGER

58:50 TERM THE POTENTIAL.

58:56 THERE ARE RISK AND THOSE NAMES AND YOU CAN SEE THAT

58:59 MODIFICATION COMING THROUGH BUT WHEN IT COMES TO TECHNOLOGY WE

59:06 LOOK AT THE LONGER-TERM HORIZON WHAT AI CAN DO AND THAT'S A

59:07 POSITION WE ARE TAKING. IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE AND IT WILL

59:11 BE UNCOMFORTABLE FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS BUT YOU TAKE THE LONG

59:16 GAME. LISA: HOWDY PRICE IN THE CHINA RISK?

59:19 THE U.S. DOING WHATEVER IT TAKES TO CURB

59:24 CHINESE TAG IN THE POTENTIAL TIKTOK BAN.

59:28 IT HASN'T BEEN FULLY PRICED IN NOT JUST ATTACK BUT THE

59:33 MULTINATIONALS? SEEMA:

59:34 I DON'T THINK THAT IS SUFFICIENTLY PRICED AND OVER

59:36 THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT LARGE-CAP THE TWO

59:42 THINGS THAT ARE CONCERNING HIS REGULATION AND CHINA.

59:44 AT THE MOMENT THOSE THINGS ARE COINCIDING.

59:47 WE DON'T THINK THAT IS BEEN FAIRLY PRESTON.

59:51 IT'S SOMETHING WE ARE WATCHING CAREFULLY IF WE WORK TO SEE

59:55 SIGNIFICANT MOVEMENT ON THAT WHICH IS CHANGING PERSPECTIVES,

59:59 THEN THAT IS THE CASE FOR REEVALUATION BUT I DON'T THINK

01:00:04 WE THERE YET. IT IMPACTS THE EARNINGS STORY

01:00:07 BUT NOT SUFFICIENTLY THAT OVER THE NEXT 3-4 YEAR HORIZON IT

01:00:10 WILL TAKE AWAY AS MUCH AS MAY BE A WOULD CONVINCE US TO

01:00:15 REDUCE OUR EXPECTATION. JONATHAN:

01:00:19 I JUST WANTED THE SIGNAL YOU TAKE FROM SOME OF THESE BIG CAP

01:00:24 STOCKS. WHAT IS THE SIGNAL YOU TAKE?

01:00:27 SEEMA: THERE ARE SPECIFIC NAMES IN

01:00:30 THERE THAT WE HAVE CONCERNS ON THE EEEV SIDE.

01:00:35 WE ARE TAKING THAT INTO CONSIDERATION ON THE EEEV SIDE.

01:00:38 WE HAVE MORE SUSTAINED CONCERNS. WHEN THE CHINA ANGLE COMES IN.

01:00:45 JONATHAN: YOU'RE IN LONDON EVERY DAY, HOW

01:00:49 DIFFERENT IS THAT IN EUROPE COMPARED TO THE U.S. AND CHINA?

01:00:52 SEEMA: I THINK THE EV MARKET IN LONDON

01:00:54 IS EXTRAORDINARILY STRONG.

01:00:57 THAT DEMAND FOR EV, THE LONDON CONGESTION SOUND IS IN THE

01:01:08 WORKS. JONATHAN:

01:01:10 REGIONALLY, IT FEELS VERY DIFFERENT.

01:01:11 THE EXPERIENCE STATESIDE IS NOT WHAT WE SEE PLAYING OUT IN

01:01:13 EUROPE AND CHINA. LISA: YEAH, BETTER ADOPTION AND THE

01:01:22 WILLINGNESS TO SEE USE OF CARD. YOU SEE THAT IN THE RENTAL CAR

01:01:26 EXPERIMENT PEOPLE SHIED AWAY FROM ELECTRIC VEHICLES BECAUSE

01:01:31 THEY WERE USED TO USING THEM. JONATHAN:

01:01:35 IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU, SEEMA SHAH WILL STICK WITH US.

01:01:43 YAHAIRA: PRESIDENT BIDEN IS WARNING

01:01:45 ISRAEL THAT ANY INVASION WOULD CROSS THE ROAD DIED IN AN

01:01:50 INTERVIEW WITH MSNBC HE CRITICIZED THE HIGH DEATH TOLL

01:01:51 IN GAZA.

01:01:56 >> THE DEFENSE OF ISRAEL IS STILL CRITICAL, THERE IS NO

01:02:01 REDLINE BUT THERE ARE RED LINES THAT YOU CANNOT HAVE 10,000

01:02:06 MORE PALESTINIANS DEAD.

01:02:15 YAHAIRA: THE MOVE ADDS TO ITS LARGEST

01:02:19 RETAIL NETWORK OUTSIDE THE U.S.. THIS DESPITE SLOWING IPHONE

01:02:26 SALES IT WILL BE APPLE'S 47TH LOCATION IN THE COUNTRY.

01:02:32 COMMONERS SECRETARY SAYS U.S. COULD FURTHER TIGHTEN CONTROL

01:02:37 TO CHINESE ACCESS TO SHIP TECHNOLOGY. ADDING THE U.S.

01:02:46 WILL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO KEEP CHINESE FIRMS FROM

01:02:51 ACCESSING U.S. CHIP INFORMATION. HER COMMENTS, AS THE BIDEN

01:02:53 ADMINISTRATION WAVE SANCTIONS ON SEVERAL CHINESE COMPANIES TO

01:02:58 CURB DEVELOPMENTS OF SEMICONDUCTORS AND THAT IS YOUR

01:03:03 BLOOMBERG GREEN. JONATHAN:

01:03:05 UP NEXT ON THE PROGRAM, WASHINGTON, DC TAKING ON TIKTOK.

01:03:11 >> IT WOULD LEAD TO A PATH TO BANDING TIKTOK.

01:03:17 IF YOU DON'T THINK THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY CAN TWIST THE

01:03:19 ALGORITHM YOU DON'T APPRECIATE THE NATURE OF THE THREAT.

01:03:26 JONATHAN: LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY THIS

01:03:27 MORNING, GOOD MORNING.

01:03:46 JONATHAN: LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY, STOCKS

01:03:53 LOWER BY

01:04:02 .5% WASHINGTON DC TAKING ON TIKTOK.

01:04:08 >> IT WOULD LEAD TO A PATH TO POTENTIALLY ENDING TIKTOK, HALF

01:04:13 OF YOUNG AMERICA GETS THEIR NEWS FROM TIKTOK IF YOU DON'T

01:04:17 THINK THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY COULD MAKE THE NEWS THEY

01:04:21 SEE REFLECTIVE OF THEIR VIEWS I DON'T THINK YOU APPRECIATE THE

01:04:22 NATURE OF THE THREAT.

01:04:28 >> ITS VALUE HAS AN ALGORITHM THAT'S THE BEST IN THE WORLD

01:04:32 AND AS LONG AS THE ENGINEERS IN CHINA CONTROL THE ALGORITHM

01:04:35 THEY HAVE ACCESS TO AMERICAN DATA. JONATHAN:

01:04:40 THE HOUSE SAID TO VOTE ON A BIPARTISAN BILL THAT COULD

01:04:44 CAUSE THE PARENT COMPANY TO DIVEST. IF THEY PASS IT, I WILL

01:04:47 SIGN IT.

01:04:53 WE WON'T GET WEATHERED THE KIDS ARE COMMUNIST ALREADY.

01:04:57 I’'M TRYING TO WORK OUT IF THEY PASS IT OR NOT.

01:05:01 >> IF THEY PUT THIS ON THE FLOOR ABLE PASS.

01:05:04 THIS COMMITTEE IS BIPARTISAN. IT HAS GLOWING MARKS ACROSS THE

01:05:09 BOARD SINCE A LAUNCH. IF IT COMES TO THE FLOOR OF THE

01:05:12 HOUSE OF WILL PASS AND WHEN IT GETS TO THE SENATE, THOSE TWO

01:05:19 GUYS ARE GOING DECIDE IF THEY TAKE IT UP OR NOT.

01:05:25 THEY HAVE GONE THROUGH NUMEROUS REITERATION, BYTEDANCE HAS

01:05:26 KNOWN THIS IS COMING. THEY HAVE GIVEN YOU FAIR

01:05:32 WARNING YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN ACTING.

01:05:38 MY EXPECTATION IS IF IT GOES TO THE FLOOR ABLE PASS.

01:05:46 I THINK THE LOBBYING FOR THAT IS WHERE IT'S AT.

01:05:51 >> KELLYANNE CONWAY IS WORKING ON BEHALF OF TIKTOK, CALLING

01:05:56 LAWMAKERS TELLING THEM WHY THEY SHOULD NOT BE FENDING FOR THOSE.

01:06:00 WE HAVE SEEN TRUMP WEIGH IN ON THE BORDER AGREEMENT.

01:06:03 DOES THAT HAPPEN WITH SPEAKER JOHNSON AND TIKTOK?

01:06:08 >> IF TRUMP WAS TO DERAIL THIS PACKAGE IN THE HOUSE HE JUST

01:06:12 NEEDS TO CALL FOR SPEAKER AND LET HIM KNOW THE BILL SHOULD

01:06:14 NOT COME FOR A VOTE. IF IT COMES TO THE FLOOR, IT

01:06:18 MEANS TRUMP'S LOBBYING HAS NOT WORKED.

01:06:25 THEY WILL BRING IT TO THE FLOOR AND IT WILL PASS BUT POLITICAL

01:06:28 MEDDLING WILL KEEP IT FROM PASSING, THE BILL IS SOUND.

01:06:33 AS IT STANDS IT CAN PASS THE

01:06:40 CONSTITUTION TEST. ANNMARIE: TO JOHN'S POINT EARLIER ON THE

01:06:44 HYPOCRISY IN WASHINGTON, THEY ARE USING THEIR CAMPAIGN FOR

01:06:45 OUTREACH >> >>? IT WOULD NOT GO INTO EFFECT FOR

01:06:48 SIX MONTHS.

01:06:54 THEY HAVE STUDIES THEY CAN CONDUCT AND IT'S UP TO THE

01:06:55 PRESIDENT FOR HIS ULTIMATE DECISION.

01:06:59 THIS KIND OF THING COULD TAKE MONTHS TO YEARS BEFORE IT HAS

01:07:03 RAMIFICATIONS. LISA:

01:07:12 WHAT PROPORTION OF CONGRESS MEMBERS CURRENTLY USE TIKTOK?

01:07:17 >> MOST OF THEM, IT'S A HUGE CAMPAIGN TOOL.

01:07:21 THE PRESIDENT JUST WAIT AND THEN WITH HIS OWN TIKTOK

01:07:25 CAMPAIGN IF YOU LOOK AT THE LETTER ALL THOSE REPUBLICANS

01:07:31 THAT ARE ADAMANTLY ANTI-BIDEN HAVE JUST WRITTEN HIM A LETTER

01:07:35 TO WEEKS AGO SAYING HOW DARE YOU? THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

01:07:46 THE HYPOCRISY IS ALL THE WAY AROUND WHICH IS WHY YOU ARE IN

01:07:50 A POLITICAL UNIVERSE. THEY'RE ALL TRYING TO SCORE

01:07:51 POINTS BACK AND FORTH. JONATHAN: POLITICIANS, HYPOCRITES?

01:07:56 SHOCKING. LISA: THEY'RE SAYING AT LEAST IT

01:08:01 WON'T GO INTO EFFECT FOR SIX MONTHS SO WE COULD STILL

01:08:09 ADVERTISE. JONATHAN: WE HAVE THE NATIONAL SECURITY

01:08:13 RISK OF EV'S NATIONAL SECURITY RISK OF

01:08:14 BYTEDANCE. FOR A LONG TIME IT WAS

01:08:17 DIFFICULT FOR COMPANIES TO OPERATE IN CHINA.

01:08:21 THERE ARE CERTAIN TECH COMPANIES THAT WERE NOT ALLOWED

01:08:23 TO BE THERE.

01:08:29 WHAT WILL THE TIT FOR TAT FOR CHINA BE?

01:08:35 >> WE ARE EXPECTING A ROTATION OF TARIFFS.

01:08:50 IF FITS TIGHTLY WITH THEIR LIDAR, ACROSS-THE-BOARD,

01:08:53 CHINESE RETALIATION IS NOT LIMITED TO WE ARE NOT BUYING

01:08:58 SOYBEANS ANYMORE IS APPLICABLE TO DIFFERENT SANCTIONS REGIME'S

01:09:01 KICKING OUT COMPANIES IN THE UNITED STATES, AND CHINA THAT

01:09:04 ARE U.S. COMPANIES, EXHAUSTIVE RED TAPE.

01:09:11 WE SAW THIS DURING THE 2017 TERRACE.

01:09:13 THEY TEND TO TAKE IT OUT ON THE CORPORATIONS OPERATING INSIDE

01:09:20 OF CHINA. LISA:

01:09:22 WHAT'S THE BYLINE THROUGH TRUMP AND BIDEN.

01:09:25 >> THE TARIFFS ARE HIGHER UNDER BIDEN THAT THEY WERE UNDER

01:09:30 TRUMP. YOU SEE CHINA AND THE EU NOT

01:09:33 NEGOTIATING WITH THE U.S. RIGHT NOW AND APART BECAUSE A

01:09:41 HYPOTHETICAL PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD CREATE LOOPHOLES OR

01:09:44 EXCLUSIONS OR LICENSES OR ONE-ON-ONE TRADE DEALS LIKE WE

01:09:50 SAW WITH THE HUAWEI WHEREIN SPECIFIC COMPANIES GET A CARVE

01:09:53 OUT YOU HAVE THESE EFFORTS BROUGHT IN SCOPE.

01:09:59 GO LOOK AT USDR EXCLUSIONS. JONATHAN:

01:10:06 HOW DIFFICULT IS LIKE GOING TO BE FOR A MULTINATIONAL

01:10:09 OPERATING IN THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA? SEEMA:

01:10:13 IT'S CLEARLY CAN BE DIFFICULT BUT WE STILL THINK FOR A

01:10:18 GOVERNMENT SAID TRIED TO HIT

01:10:20 ITS OWN MAJOR INDUSTRY THERE IS SOME HESITATION THAT THERE WILL

01:10:25 BE SOME KIND OF LOOPHOLES. WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE

01:10:30 ELECTION WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, THE REST OF THE WORLD

01:10:33 IS GOING TO SUFFER. IT STILL POINTS OUT TO U.S.

01:10:36 EXCEPTIONALISM. THERE WILL BE PRESIDENTS FOR

01:10:38 U.S. MARKETS AND INDUSTRIES AT THE

01:10:42 END OF IT WHERE EUROPE AND CHINA WILL BE THE BIGGEST LOSER.

01:10:49 LISA:

01:10:50 REGARDLESS OF THE HEATED RHETORIC NOTHING WOULD GET

01:10:53 IMPLEMENTED THAT WOULD START THIS TIT FOR TAT WAR THAT COULD

01:10:56 CAUSE MAJOR HURDLES FOR MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES? SEEMA:

01:11:02 IN TERMS OF THE HEAD, WHO WILL IT GREATEST TO?

01:11:06 I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE THE U.S. I THINK IT WILL ONLY HIT

01:11:08 PARTICULARLY NEGATIVE FOR CHINA AND EUROPE.

01:11:11 IF YOU'RE DOING A VALUE TRADE THE U.S.

01:11:16 COMES OUT PARTICULARLY WELL. ANNMARIE:

01:11:19 WHAT DO YOU THINK THE U.S. IS THINKING ABOUT EXPANDING,

01:11:24 CHINESE EV'S CAN'T GET INTO THE U.S. BUT ITALY IS CONTACTING TO

01:11:29 CREATE A FACILITY. THIS IS NOT THE APPROACH BIDEN

01:11:31 WAS TRYING TO TAKE.

01:11:35 >> EUROPE HAS TO MAKE HIS DECISION DO YOU SIDE WITH THE

01:11:36 U.S. OR CHINA?

01:11:44 EUROPE HAS TERRIBLE FUNDAMENTALS AND THEY NEED TO

01:11:48 BE LANDING WHERE THERE IS THE BEST GROWTH AND THAT TAKE

01:11:52 PRECEDENCE. JONATHAN: CAN REFLECT ON THE GOOD OLD

01:11:56 DAYS OF 2020 WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS EXACT ISSUE

01:12:00 AROUND BYTEDANCE AND TIKTOK. IT WAS NOT MICROSOFT IT WAS

01:12:06 ORACLE AND WALMART AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO CALL IT, A

01:12:11 KICKBACK FEED TO THE TREASURY? $5 BILLION?

01:12:20 IT WAS ODD BUT THAT WHOLE SITUATION WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP

01:12:23 AND TIKTOK. DO WE UNDERSTAND THE POSITION

01:12:26 WITH THE PRESIDENT AND TIKTOK?

01:12:34 >> FOUR YEARS AGO IT WAS BANNED TIKTOK.

01:12:36 IT WAS WELL DOCUMENTED, YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEARCH FOR IT AND

01:12:39 NOW THAT HAS MATERIALLY SHIFTED. YOU HAD TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE

01:12:45 PRESIDENT'S VERBIAGE, ME AND THE CLUB FOR GROWTH ARE BACK IN

01:12:47 LOVE AGAIN. HIS TO DO WITH THE TOWEL

01:12:52 MILLION DONATION THAT SAVED CLUB FOR GROWTH.

01:12:59 WE WERE ALL WATCHING AS KELLYANNE CONWAY MOVE THE

01:13:00 NEEDLE WITH THE PRESIDENT THROUGHOUT HIS TENURE IN THE

01:13:02 WHITE HOUSE. TO THINK SHE IS ACTIVELY

01:13:10 LOBBYING ON BEHALF OF THIS INSTITUTION GOING OUT TO 10

01:13:14 MEMBERS, THAT'S ALL IT TAKES TO GET TO SYNC THE BILL.

01:13:18 IF DEMOCRATS DECIDE THEY WANT TO PASS IT, KELLYANNE CONWAY

01:13:23 HAS HER WORK CUT OUT FOR HER.

01:13:30 I THINK IT IS A HARD THING TO DO WHICH IS WHY ESSAY SEE IF IT

01:13:31 EVEN COMES UP. JONATHAN: JUST A MAJOR SHED.

01:13:37 HENRIETTA, IT IS GREAT TO SEE YOU.

01:13:45 COMING UP ON THIS PROGRAM, ONE YEAR ON FROM THE COLLAPSE OF

01:13:49 SVB AND THAT CONVERSATION OF NEXT.

01:14:03 JONATHAN: COMING OUT THE BACK OF A VERY

01:14:07 RARE WEEK OF LOSSES ON THE S&P. WE HAVE SEEN SO MANY WEEKS OF

01:14:09 GAINS YEAR TO DATE.

01:14:18 EQUITY FUTURES NEGATIVE BY .15% ON THE NASDAQ 100 SOFTER BY

01:14:21 0.21%. I'M SURE LOTS OF YOU WOULD LIKE

01:14:26 AN NVIDIA CHECK. NEGATIVE BY 1%. AFTER WILD SWINGS ON FRIDAY'S

01:14:33 SESSION. LISA: THREE HUNDRED BILLION CREATED

01:14:38 AND LOST, JUST OVERNIGHT. LET ALONE 250 BILLION LAWS JUST

01:14:43 ON FRIDAY. IS THIS THE TOPPING OUT OF

01:14:50 STOCK SPLIT OF GAME A HUNDRED MILLION PERCENT THIS YEAR.

01:14:54 JONATHAN: PRETTY RIDICULOUS ON THAT NAME.

01:14:59 YIELDS ARE HIGHER BY TWO BASIS POINTS LET'S CALL THIS 4.5 OH,

01:15:05 MORE THAN 20 BASIS POINTS LOWER THAN WHERE WE WERE TWO WEEKS

01:15:07 AGO AT THE CLOSE TODAY. AND WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE

01:15:13 DATED TO SEE IF IT WOULD COME FROM THE JANUARY, SPECIFICALLY

01:15:16 THE LABOR MARKET DID NOT CONFIRM. LISA:

01:15:21 IT WAS THE REVISIONS DOWN THAT LEFT THE AVERAGE OUT OF LOWER

01:15:24 PACE THAN IF THE EXPECTATIONS WERE MET.

01:15:27 IT WAS A TWO-PRONGED WOMEN. YOU HAD FED CHAIR JAY POWELL

01:15:33 NOT PUSHING BACK AGAINST THE ACTION WE'VE SEEN IN WE HAVE

01:15:36 SEEN DOWN SIDE SURPRISES THAT HAVE COME DOWN, LOOKING FOR

01:15:40 GOLDILOCKS. JONATHAN: LET'S GET THE HIGH RATES OR

01:15:44 LACK THEREOF IN JAPAN. ULTIMATELY, JAPAN IS LOOKING AT

01:15:52 HIKING INTEREST RATE SINCE THE FIRST TIME IN 2007.

01:15:59 FIVE CONSECUTIVE YEN, THE FIRST TIME WE'VE SEEN THAT SINCE JULY

01:16:00 2023. I LOST COUNT OF THE AMOUNT OF

01:16:06 REPORTS WE'VE HAD OVER THE LAST WEEK.

01:16:11 WE HAD SOURCES AROUND THE BOJ SUGGESTING THEIR GAINING

01:16:12 CONFIDENCE IN THE WAGE DATA.

01:16:19 WE HAD SOURCES SAYING THEY WERE COMFORTABLE HIKING RATES.

01:16:23 IN SOME SUGGESTION THEY WOULD GIVE UP YOUR CURVE CONTROL IS

01:16:25 WELL. WHEN WE GET THE FIRST FEEDBACK

01:16:32 FROM ONE OF THE LARGEST UNIONS ABOUT WAGE NEGOTIATIONS IN

01:16:37 JAPAN MAY BE THAT LEADS TO A BOJ THAT HIKES RATES? LISA:

01:16:42 THE MARKET CONSENSUS IS THEY WILL RAISE RATES, ARE THEY

01:16:47 GOING TO GO TO 0, 0 .5 FOUR THEY CONTINUED THEIR BONDED ETF

01:16:49 PURCHASES? THE MARKETS ARE NOT FREAKING

01:16:53 OUT. YOU ARE NOT SEEING MASSIVE DISRUPTION, THEY HAVE AN

01:16:58 OPENING DO THEY JUST DRIVE THROUGH IT? JONATHAN:

01:17:05 SEEMA SHAH WAS WITH US AND SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE ECB AND

01:17:10 THE LIMITS THEY CAN PRODUCE INTEREST RATES OF THE FEDERAL

01:17:11 RESERVE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING.

01:17:17 THEN YOU HAVE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEM AND THE BOJ. LISA:

01:17:22 YOU DON'T HAVE THE SAME RUNAWAY GUILDS THAT COULD

01:17:25 HAPPEN IF YOU HAVE THE REST OF THE WORLD HIKING RATES.

01:17:31 WILL WE LOOK BACK AND SAY OPERATION OSTRICH WAS

01:17:36 SUCCESSFUL? JONATHAN:

01:17:37 POSSIBLY THAT WAS A ONE-SIDED GENERATION OPPORTUNITY TO

01:17:41 REFRAME AND REDO INFLATION EXPECTATION IN JAPAN.

01:17:45 THAT INFLATION WAS A WELCOME STORY AND EVERYWHERE ALSO WAS

01:17:50 NOT.

01:17:50 IT'S WHAT THEY'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR FOR DECADES AND ABRASIVE.

01:17:54 LISA: WHAT IS THE IMPLICATION FOR

01:17:56 EQUITIES WHICH IN JAPAN HAVE BEEN RUNNING AWAY GIVEN THE

01:18:00 FACT IT MAY NOT BE AS CHEAP IF YOU HAVE DOLLARS TO GO WHEN

01:18:06 ABIDE? JONATHAN:

01:18:07 TWO FAVORITE SECTORS RIGHT NOW TO AND DISCRETIONARY STATESIDE.

01:18:10 TWO FAVORITE REACHES U.S. AND JAPAN.

01:18:16 JAPAN AFTER THE DOLLAR-YEN THAT MOVED TO A DOLLAR 50 AND STAYED

01:18:17 THERE.

01:18:24 DO YOU NEED DOLLAR WEAKNESS FOR JAPANESE YEN TO PERFORM WELL?

01:18:26 JAPANESE EQUITIES CARRIED ON RIPPING.

01:18:29 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU START TO SEE YEN STRENGTH KICK IN?

01:18:38 IF YOU GO FROM 1.5, 1.30 WILL JAPANESE STOCKS HOLD UP IN THE

01:18:39 FACE OF THAT? LISA: OVERNIGHT IT WASN'T

01:18:44 NECESSARILY POSITIVE. THAT WILL BE THE KEY QUESTION

01:18:47 FOR THAT FAVORITE TRADE. JONATHAN:

01:18:51 UNDER SURVEILLANCE THIS MORNING OUR TOP STORY THE FED ENTERING

01:18:59 THE QUIET PERIOD WITH PLENTY OF

01:19:06 DATA TO SUGGEST, DIGEST. CPI, RETAIL SALES AND JOBLESS CLAIMS

01:19:10 IN THE QUESTION WE ASKED FRIDAY HOW DEPENDENT IS THIS

01:19:13 ECONOMIC DATA? LISA: MOHAMED EL-ERIAN SAID THEY

01:19:19 NEED TO ROADMAP BECAUSE THEY GET REVISED DOWNWARD AND THEY

01:19:23 DON'T HAVE A ROADMAP. WHAT YOU DO WITH THIS DATA?

01:19:27 YOUR PEOPLE GAMING IT OUT. CPI WILL BE REALLY IMPORTANT

01:19:31 BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE WEAKNESS OR STRENGTH AND YOU DON'T HAVE

01:19:35 INFLATION IT DOESN'T MATTER. JONATHAN:

01:19:38 MOHAMMED SAID THAT DATA POINT WHATEVER YOU WANTED TO MEAN, IT

01:19:42 EXPLAINS A MARKET PERFORMANCE WE SAW ON FRIDAY. ANNMARIE:

01:19:46 IT EXPLODES WITH THE ADMINISTRATION WAS SAYING, THIS

01:19:52 RE-ENFORCES A SOFT LANDING BUT THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN TOUTING

01:19:57 THIS MANUFACTURING NUMBER, BUT NOT IN THE MOST RECENT LABOR

01:20:01 REPORT, DOWN BY 4000 REPORTS. JONATHAN:

01:20:07 THUS THE ECONOMIC DATA, THAT'S YOUR WEEK AHEAD TO FRAME IT FOR

01:20:09 YOU. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE POLITICS.

01:20:16 THE LATEST FROM THE PRESIDENT AGAINST THE ATTACK ON THE

01:20:20 SOUTHERN CITY OF RAFAH. HE PREVIOUSLY HOPE TO HAVE A

01:20:25 CEASE-FIRE BY THE BEGINNING OF RAMADAN BUT THE HOLY MONTH

01:20:30 STARTED AT SUNDOWN. THEY SAID THEY HAVE TO INVADE

01:20:34 PROFIT BECAUSE IS THE LAST BASTION OF HAMAS BUT IT WOULD

01:20:38 BE A CROSSING OF A REDLINE. LISA:

01:20:43 THERE WAS A NUANCED APPROACH THAT BIDED TOOK.

01:20:45 HE WANTED TO SHOW A LITTLE SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL AND SUPPORT

01:20:49 THE PALESTINIANS AND MAKING

01:20:55 SURE THAT MESSAGE WAS RELATED TO THE MSNBC IN THE LAB.

01:21:01 HE SAID THE DEFENSE OF ISRAEL IS STILL CRITICAL BUT A REDLINE

01:21:03 WITH PALESTINIAN LIVES I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANOTHER 30,000

01:21:06 PALESTINIANS DEAD. JONATHAN:

01:21:12 WAS THAT THROWN TOGETHER ON THE WEEKEND? ANNMARIE:

01:21:18 IT WAS PUT TOGETHER BECAUSE HE VIEWED THE STATED THE UNION AS

01:21:22 A KICKSTART ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND THERE WAS ANOTHER

01:21:23 PART OF THE INTERVIEW THAT GOES TO THIS IDEA OF WAS THIS THROWN

01:21:28 TOGETHER? HE RECEIVED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT

01:21:33 OF PUSHBACK ON THE USE OF ILLEGAL WHEN TALKING ABOUT THE

01:21:36 ALLEGED IMMIGRANT THAT KILLED THAT YOUNG GIRL IN GEORGIA WHEN

01:21:42 HE HAD THAT MOMENT WHERE REPRESENTATIVE MARJORIE TAYLOR

01:21:49 GREENE IN THE INTERVIEW HE SAID HE REGRETTED IT. JONATHAN:

01:21:54 WILL THE FAR LEFT OF THE PARTY ISOLATE THE REST OF THE COUNTRY?

01:21:58 ANNMARIE: FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FAMILY

01:22:02 IS MEETING WITH LINCOLN RALLIES FAMILY AND THE LEFT IS DEBATING

01:22:07 ABOUT WORDS AND WHAT THEY WOULD CALL SEMANTICS, WHILE THE RIGHT

01:22:10 IS TALKING ABOUT THE FACT AT THE END OF THE DAY, THIS PERSON

01:22:13 ALLEGEDLY MURDERED A CITIZEN.

01:22:19 JONATHAN: YESTERDAY MARKING THE ONE-YEAR

01:22:21 ANNIVERSARY SINCE THE COLLAPSE OF SILICON VALLEY BANK LEADING

01:22:27 TO THE WORST MONTH SINCE THE PANDEMIC.

01:22:33 NEW YORK COMMUNITY BANKS EXPOSURE TO COMMERCIAL REAL

01:22:34 ESTATE SINKING AT STOCK.

01:22:42 TO WEIGH IN OVER THE PAST 12 MONTHS, HERMANN CHAN FOR

01:22:46 BLOOMBERG INTELLIGENCE. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE LAST 12

01:22:50 MONTHS BEFORE WE GET INTO THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.

01:22:51 WHAT IF WE LEARN THE WHAT IF WE CHANGE? HERMAN:

01:22:59 REGIONAL BANKS THAT HAVE BEEN OVER RELIANCE OR CONCENTRATION

01:23:03 CAN LEAD TO INSTABILITY. WE SAW THAT WITH SVB AND THEIR

01:23:08 INTEREST RATE RISK AND SECURITIES PORTFOLIO AND WE ARE

01:23:11 SEEING IT IN NEW YORK COMMUNITY WITH CONCENTRATION RISK AND

01:23:18 MULTIFAMILY REAL ESTATE, BRITT REGULATED APARTMENT LENDING.

01:23:21 THE REST OF THE REGIONAL BANKS HAVE A MORE DIVERSE INVESTMENT.

01:23:28 THAT SERVES THEM IN OPERATING ENVIRONMENTS. LISA:

01:23:32 WHERE ARE WE ON THE REGULATIONS TARGETING SMALLER

01:23:34 BANKS THAT HAVE BEEN HIGHLY CONTENTIOUS?

01:23:38 HAVE THEY MOVED CLOSER TO REALITY OR FURTHER AWAY? HERMAN:

01:23:42 IT DEPENDS ON WHICH REGULATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:23:46 THE BASEL THREE ENDGAME RULES

01:23:53 OF INFLUX GIVEN THE COM MENT FROM THE FEDERALLY.

01:23:58 WE EXPECT THE ENDGAME TO INCORPORATE THE UNREALIZED

01:24:02 LOSSES IN THE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO WITHIN THE CAPITAL

01:24:06 REGULATIONS. WE ARE CLOSER TO REALITY.

01:24:09 WE ARE STILL WAITING TO HEAR POTENTIAL ROLES DOWN THE PIKE

01:24:16 INCLUDING A LIQUIDITY POTENTIAL RATIO WHICH WOULD ADDRESS THE

01:24:22 OUTFLOW ISSUE THAT SVB FACE AFTER. LISA:

01:24:25 THERE HAS BEEN RELUCTANCE BECAUSE A LOT OF TRANSACTIONS

01:24:30 HAVE NOT GONE THROUGH. DO HAVE A SENSE HOW PENT UP THE

01:24:36 DEMAND IS TO CONSOLIDATE SHOULD THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT BE

01:24:39 MORE AMENABLE TO THAT TYPE OF TRANSACTION? HERMAN:

01:24:45 ONE YEAR AFTER SVB, AN IMPORTANT LESSON IS SCALE

01:24:52 REALLY MATTERS.

01:24:54 YOU HEARD THAT VOCALLY FROM BNC, BANKS LIKE U.S.

01:24:56 BANK HAVE GAINED SCALE IN RECENT YEARS.

01:25:00 THE INDUSTRY IS REALLY WATCHING WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN WITH

01:25:04 THE CAPITAL ONE/DISCOVERY DEAL ONE OF THE LARGEST DEALS WE

01:25:06 SEEN IN THE PAST TWO YEARS.

01:25:12 AND IF IT DOES GET REGULATORY APPROVAL IT CAN OPEN UP THE

01:25:15 FLOODGATES FOR MORE M&A. ANNMARIE:

01:25:23 WHAT OPTIMISM DO YOU HAVE THE DEAL GOES THROUGH BECAUSE THE

01:25:25 DIRECTION OF TRAVEL IN WASHINGTON IS TO BLOCK THESE

01:25:26 TYPES OF DEALS? HERMAN: YOU HAVE HEARD A LOT OF

01:25:32 CONSTERNATION FROM THE DEMOCRATS INCLUDING SENATOR

01:25:37 WARREN IN TERMS OF THE COMPETITION INVOLVING CREDIT

01:25:44 CARDS.

01:25:45 IN OUR VIEW, OUR COLLEAGUES SEES A BETTER OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:25:49 APPROVAL AND I WOULD POINT TO THE FACT THAT IF WE ARE TALKING

01:25:55 ABOUT VISA AND MASTERCARD, THEY COULD POTENTIALLY CREATE A

01:25:56 THIRD PLAYER IN THAT SPACE WHICH WOULD OPEN UP MORE

01:26:00 COMPETITION WHICH WOULD BE GREAT FOR THE ECONOMY. JONATHAN:

01:26:04 HERMANN CHAIR THERE FOR BLOOMBERG INTELLIGENCE.

01:26:06 YOU THINK ABOUT WHERE WE WERE 12 MONTHS AGO NO LANDING TURNED

01:26:13 IN TO HARD THE HERE WE ARE 5.5%, GDP GROWTH IS CONSISTENT

01:26:18 AND PEOPLE ARE REALLY TALKING ABOUT IT ANYMORE. LISA:

01:26:23 IDIOSYNCRATIC AND HOW LONG CAN IT REMAIN THE STORY WHEN YOU

01:26:31 HAVEN'T SEEN THAT CAVE YOU INDEX RECOVER MATERIALLY?

01:26:34 JONATHAN: CAN WE GET THROUGH THIS CYCLE

01:26:37 WITHOUT CREDIT ISSUES. IF LAST YEAR WAS A GREAT STORY,

01:26:43 WILL THIS YEAR BE A YEAR OF CREDIT ISSUE?

01:26:48 WE ARE WILLING TO LOOK AT A SINGLE IDENTITY. LISA:

01:26:54 A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING THIS MATURITY WHILE ISN'T

01:26:58 COMING TO THE FORE YET AND WITH NEW YORK COMMUNITY BANK IT HAD

01:27:02 ISSUES THAT HAVE TO DEAL WITH NEW YORK CITY.

01:27:07 I KEEP GOING BACK TO HOWARD MARKS WOULD MATURITIES COME DUE.

01:27:13 WILL WE SEE THOSE HIGHER RATES BITE IN A MATERIAL WAY?

01:27:17 IT'S BEEN A VERY LONG AND PROLAPSED. JONATHAN:

01:27:22 CAN THEY SURVIVE UNTIL 2025? EQUITY FUTURES NEGATIVE 5.2%.

01:27:27 HERE IS YOUR BLOOMBERG READ. YAHAIRA:

01:27:33 WRITE IT AND INVESTORS ARE SEEKING TO RAISE 750 MILLION IN

01:27:36 WHAT WOULD BE THE BIGGEST IPO'S THIS YEAR.

01:27:43 THE COMPANY PLANS TO OFFER 22 MILLION SHARES PRICED BETWEEN

01:27:47 31-$41 EACH. CREDIT IS SEEKING A LISTING ON

01:27:50 THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE. MORE TROUBLE FOR BOEING, DELTA

01:27:58 EXPECTS DELIVERIES OF ITS BOEING 737 MAX AIRCRAFTS COULD

01:28:04 BE PUSHED OUT TILL 2027. DELTA CEO SAID YESTERDAY IT HAD

01:28:10 EXPECTED TO RECEIVE THE AIRCRAFT NEXT YEAR BUT IS NOW

01:28:12 ANTICIPATING DELAYS. THE AIRLINE HAS ORDERS FOR MAX

01:28:20 AND PLANS AND OPTIONS TO PURCHASE 30 MORE.

01:28:26 WARREN BUFFETT BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY SOLD 1% OF ITS STAKE

01:28:29 LAST QUARTER THE LAST TIME THEY SOLD THE STOCK THE SELLING

01:28:34 PERSISTED FOR SEVERAL QUARTERS. APPLE HAS BEEN HIT HARD BY A

01:28:41 SLEW OF NEGATIVE NEWS INCLUDING 2 BILLION TRUST FINE AND

01:28:45 SCRAPPING OF A DECADE LONG CAR PROJECT.

01:28:49 THE STOCK IS DOWN 11% THIS YEAR. JONATHAN:

01:28:55 I'M NEXT ON THIS PROGRAM, LOOKING AHEAD TO THIS WEEK'S

01:28:56 BIG DATA POINT.

01:29:00 >> THEY'VE DONE A GOOD JOB IN TERMS OF GETTING TO A

01:29:01 NORMALIZED LEVEL OF POLICY. INTEREST RATE CUTS ARE VERY

01:29:07 MUCH IN THE PICTURE, I THINK THAT IS QUITE REASONABLE.

01:29:10 JONATHAN: THAT CONVERSATION UP NEXT, BUY

01:29:13 FROM NEW YORK CITY. THIS IS BLOOMBERG.

01:29:31 JONATHAN: STOCK SEWERS ON THE S&P 500,

01:29:34 FUTURES -5.2%. YIELDS ALMOST A BASIS POINT.

01:29:41 UNCHANGED ACROSS THE BOARD. EURO-DOLLAR GOING NOWHERE.

01:29:47 IF YOU WANT SOME PRICE ACTION GO TO DOLLAR-YEN, FIVE DAYS OF

01:29:52 YEN STRENGTH WITH PLENTY OF SPECULATION THEY WILL BE HIKING

01:29:53 MAY BE AS SOON AS THIS MONTH. LOOKING AHEAD TO THIS WEEK'S

01:29:58 BIG DATA POINT.

01:30:03 >> THEY ARE MOSTLY FOCUSED AROUND INFLATION.

01:30:05 THEY THINK THEY HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB AND STARTING TO GET TO

01:30:09 A NORMALIZED LEVEL OF POLICY AND THEY DON'T NEED INFLATION

01:30:13 TO BE A TARGET TO CUT INTEREST RATES THEY CAN NORMALIZE POLICY

01:30:19 AS THE ECONOMY REACHES OF BETTER BALANCE.

01:30:21 INTEREST RATE CUTS ARE VERY MUCH IN THE PICTURE.

01:30:23 I THINK THAT'S QUITE REASONABLE. JONATHAN: I KEY WEEK OF U.S.

01:30:29 DATA WITH FEBRUARY CPI REPORT SAID TO DETERMINE WHETHER TO

01:30:33 ADD TO BULLISH WAGES.

01:30:41 THE DISINFLATIONARY CONTINUES WILL IT BE THE CAUSE FOR BREAK

01:30:42 BECAUSE? IF THERE WAS A TIME TO BUY

01:30:47 T-BILLS UNTIL IT WASN'T LAST YEAR, IS NOW.

01:30:52 KRISHNA JOINS US NOW. WHY IS IT T-BILLS UNTIL NOW?

01:30:58 CHRISTMAS: WHEN EVERYONE WAS GETTING

01:31:05 EXCITED ABOUT RATES AT 5.5% WE WERE ON THE VERGE OF EQUITIES

01:31:06 DOING WELL. IF YOU BOIL THINGS DOWN, THE

01:31:11 U.S. ECONOMY CONTINUES TO DO WELL,

01:31:12 INFLATION IS GOING DOWN. THIS SET UP IS PERFECT.

01:31:17 MARCUS HAVE DISCOUNTED THAT. I THINK LOOKING FOR EQUITY

01:31:24 MARKETS TO DO FABULOUSLY WELL FROM HERE IS PRETTY SMALL.

01:31:28 ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU GET 5.5 PERCENT RETURN ON T-BILLS SO

01:31:34 YOU CAN AFFORD TO WAIT. JONATHAN:

01:31:36 DO YOU THINK WERE ON THE PRECIPICE OF EQUITY MARKET

01:31:38 WEAKNESS? KRISHNA: I DON'T THINK WERE ON THE

01:31:45 PRECIPICE OF ECONOMIC WEAKNESS, MAY BE A SLOW DOWN BUT A

01:31:48 SLOWDOWN THAT IS MANAGEABLE. THE GROWTH RATE IS QUITE

01:31:49 SUBSTANTIAL. THESE ARE NOMINAL INSTRUMENTS.

01:31:56 I DON'T THINK THERE IS A BIG CORRECTION IN THE OFFING.

01:31:59 A SIGNIFICANT RALLY IS NOT IN THE OFFING INVESTED DIFFERENCE.

01:32:04 LISA: WHEN DO YOU STOP BUYING T-BILLS AGILITY?

01:32:08 KRISHNA: FOR THAT, THE PROBABILITY OF

01:32:11 RATE CUTS. WE ARE THINKING OF JUNE BUT

01:32:14 THERE IS A WHOLE LOT OF SPACE BETWEEN NOW AND JUNE.

01:32:16 WE WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO WORK THROUGH THAT PERIOD BEFORE IT

01:32:22 BECOMES A TIME FOR GETTING BACK INTO EQUITIES IN A MEANINGFUL

01:32:28 WAY. LISA:

01:32:29 DON'T YOU HAVE FOA MO? I WELLPOINT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE

01:32:34 A NEGATIVE MORE THAN A POSITIVE? KRISHNA:

01:32:38 IF YOU LOOK AT IT FROM AN EQUITY INVESTOR STANDPOINT AS

01:32:48 OPPOSED TO NVIDIA PERSPECTIVE. NO ONE WANTS TO LOOK AT IT THIS

01:32:49 WAY. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS,

01:32:55 EQUITIES HAVE DONE WELL BUT AWAY FROM TECH IT HASN'T DONE

01:32:58 SPECTACULARLY WELL AND THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY IN THAT SPACE IF

01:33:01 THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO GROW.

01:33:07 IF THERE IS GOING TO BE FOMO IT WILL BE THE U.S.

01:33:09 ECONOMY REMAINING AT THIS PACE ON A SUSTAINED BASIS THAN WHAT

01:33:11 WE ARE THINKING TODAY. LISA: T-BILLS UNTIL, INSTEAD OF WHAT?

01:33:19 IF YOU LIKE BIG TECH AND THERE

01:33:26 IS STRENGTH OF THE ECONOMY, YOU WANT TO BE EXPOSED TO THAT AS

01:33:27 WELL? KRISHNA: I DON'T THINK IT IS SAYING

01:33:33 YOU'RE EQUITY EXPOSURE SHOULD BE ZERO.

01:33:36 THIS IS PROBABLY NOT THE TIME TO BE ADDING EQUITY EXPOSURE IS

01:33:38 REALLY THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE.

01:33:42 WE ARE IN A SIDEWAYS MARKET FOR THE TIME BEING AND IN THAT

01:33:46 ENVIRONMENT, WHY TAKE THE RISK WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO?

01:33:50 YOU CAN GET 5.5% OR A LITTLE MORE THAN THAT. JONATHAN:

01:33:55 I WOULD NOT FRAME U.S. A RAGING BEAR.

01:33:59 YOU SAID THE BIGGEST RISK WAS AN UPSIDE RISK TO EQUITIES.

01:34:01 THIS IS A CHANGE FOR YOU. WHAT IS FED POLICY MEAN FOR YOU

01:34:06 AND HOW IT INFORMS HER FOR YOU? HAVE IN A WHILE WHAT THE RUSH,

01:34:09 WHY DO ANYTHING? IF THEY WIN THE ARGUMENT ON THE

01:34:15 FOMC AND THE FED DOES NEXT TO NOTHING THIS YEAR, WHAT IS THAT

01:34:18 MEAN FOR STOCKS, EQUITIES? KRISHNA:

01:34:25 THAT IS REALLY THE QUESTION AND THE ANSWER OF T-BILL UNTIL HIS

01:34:29 DEAL WITH THOSE KIND OF FOMC MEMBERS.

01:34:33 IF WE GO BACK TO WHAT WELL THERE WAS SAYING THAT LAST

01:34:36 YEAR, HE WAS FAR MORE RULES-BASED.

01:34:41 WHAT CAME OUT IN FEBRUARY, JANUARY IS THE U.S.

01:34:44 ECONOMY IS DECELERATING. LIKE EVERY GOOD CENTRAL BANKER

01:34:47 HE WANTS TO KEEP HIS OPTIONS OPEN AND THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE

01:34:52 DOING. THE LIKELIHOOD OF THEM NOT

01:34:54 CUTTING THIS YEAR IS ZERO.

01:35:00 AT THE SAME TIME, THE LIKELIHOOD OF THEM BEING IN A

01:35:02 HURRY TO CUT, THOUSAND PRETTY SMALL AS WELL.

01:35:05 THUS THE REASON WHY THE MARKETS WILL REMAIN SIDEWAYS. JONATHAN:

01:35:11 LET'S MAKE KRISHNA AND EDITOR OF THOSE SPEECHES.

01:35:17 YOU COULD REVIVE COMMENTS FROM FED OFFICIALS, DOES ANY OF

01:35:18 ATTENTION AT ALL? KRISHNA: IF YOU LOOK AT HAWKINS

01:35:27 TESTIMONY OF CHAIR POWELL, IT WAS THE SAME THING HE GAVE AT

01:35:29 THE PRESSER. NOTHING HAS REALLY CHANGED.

01:35:32 IN THE U.S. ECONOMY, NOTHING HAS CHANGED.

01:35:36 WHAT MAY HAVE CHANGED SLIGHTLY AS THE STRENGTHEN THE ECONOMY

01:35:38 OF THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF THE YEAR BUT THE EMPLOYMENT REPORT

01:35:42 DOES AWAY WITH THAT, ISM AND OTHER THINGS DO AWAY WITH THAT

01:35:44 AS WELL.

01:35:52 AS LONG AS I WAS THE CASE, FOR US IT MARKETS WHAT MATTERS MORE

01:35:54 AND HOW LIKELY ARE THEY TO RAISE RATES?

01:36:00 AS LONG AS THAT IS NOT IN THE PICTURE, WE ARE ALL GOOD. LISA:

01:36:03 WHY ISN'T THE DOLLAR STRONGER? KRISHNA:

01:36:09 IT'S NOT STRONGER BECAUSE THE LIKELIHOOD OF RATES GOING UP IS

01:36:10 NOT MEANINGFULLY STRONG.

01:36:16 THE DRIVER OF THAT -- IF THE ECONOMY CONTINUED ON THE PESO

01:36:19 WAS IN JANUARY OF FEBRUARY I WOULD'VE EXPECTED THE DOLLAR TO

01:36:23 STRENGTHEN FURTHER. SUBSEQUENT DATA IS TAKING WAY

01:36:27 AS A ONE-OFF RATHER THAN SUSTAINED. JONATHAN:

01:36:34 I WONDER IF WE HAVE SEEN THE PEAK OF THAT STORY?

01:36:37 GROWTH INFLATION WILL IMPROVE AND PLACES LIKE EUROPE, U.K.

01:36:39 RELATIVE TO WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE U.S.? KRISHNA:

01:36:44 IF YOU LOOK BACK AT THE NOMINAL GROWTH RATE WHICH MATTERS MORE

01:36:45 THAN ANYTHING ELSE. IT IS EXCEPTIONAL. JONATHAN:

01:36:51 WITHOUT A DOUBT BUT HAVE WE SEEN THE PEAK OF THAT STORY

01:36:55 WITH MATTERS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE? KRISHNA:

01:36:59 THE LIKELIHOOD WE WILL GO BACK AND REVISIT THE GROWTH RATES

01:37:04 THAT WE HAD IN 2021, 2022, I DON'T THINK THAT IS IN THE

01:37:05 CARDS ANYMORE. JONATHAN: I WONDER IF THAT'S A BETTER WAY

01:37:11 TO THINK ABOUT IT IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE.

01:37:14 THE SPREAD BETWEEN EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES WAS WIDE AND

01:37:18 IT WILL STAY WIDE BUT CAN I GET WIDER?

01:37:19 THAT'S A QUESTION WERE TRYING TO ANSWER?

01:37:25 DON'T WORRY KRISHNA, YOU JUMP IN. KRISHNA:

01:37:31 I THINK EXPECTING EUROPE TO KEEP UP THE SAME PACE AS THE

01:37:34 U.S. IN THE CURRENT CONTEXT, THAT IS

01:37:36 UNLIKELY. JONATHAN:

01:37:42 CAN A CLOSER THE GAP? KRISHNA:

01:37:48 BUT THAT WILL COME FROM U.S. DECELERATION. JONATHAN:

01:37:53 FX DOESN'T CARE BECAUSE YOU WILL HAVE TO PUSH START RATE

01:37:57 TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE. KRISHNA: I THINK EUROPEAN GROWTH HAS

01:38:03 BEEN OK COMPARED UP TO WHERE IT'S BEEN IN THE LAST 10, 15

01:38:04 YEARS. LISA: BASICALLY HE DOESN'T THINK

01:38:09 PARITY IS LIKELY. JONATHAN: THAT'S WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE.

01:38:19 JONATHAN: CHRIS MED, I ENJOYED THIS.

01:38:22 I'VE ENJOYED THIS BAIT.

01:38:29 COMING UP, WE WILL CATCH UP WITH BANK OF AMERICA AND

01:38:32 BLOOMBERG'S ED LUDLOW. A WHOLE LOT TO COME, FROM NEW

01:38:36 YORK CITY THIS MORNING, GOOD MORNING. ♪

01:39:01 >> THE BAR FOR THE FED TO CUT IS LONG WAY FROM THE INFLATION

01:39:03 FRONT, SHOWING CONTINUED MODERATION.

01:39:06 >> THE MARKET IS PRICING IN THE SUMMER.

01:39:08 THAT IS QUITE REASONABLE.

01:39:12 >> THEY HAVE ROOM TO BE VERY PATIENT.

01:39:15 >> LIKELY YOU COULD SEE THE RATE CUTS GET PUSHED BACK.

01:39:18 THERE IS A CYCLICAL RECOVERY ROOM IN THIS ECONOMY WHICH MAY

01:39:21 OR MAY NOT SUPPORT THAT JUNE CUT.

01:39:25 >> THE BASELINE REMAINS TWO OR THREE CUTS STARTING IN JUNE.

01:39:29 HOPEFULLY NOW WE HAVE LESS CHATTER ABOUT A HIKE OR NO

01:39:33 HIKES THIS YEAR.

01:39:35 >> THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE WITH JONATHAN

01:39:39 FERRO, LISA ABRAMOVITZ, AND ANNMARIE HORDERN. JONATHAN:

01:39:41 GOOD MORNING. THIS IS BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE.

01:39:43 YOUR EQUITY MARKET IS NEGATIVE BY ONE THIRD OF 1% ON THE S&P

01:39:50 500. CHAIRMAN POWELL SAYS HE NEEDS

01:39:53 MORE EVIDENCE. HE WILL GET MORE EVIDENCE THIS

01:39:55 WEEK. CPI, PPI, RETAIL SALES, JOBLESS

01:40:00 CLAIMS ALL ON DECK. LISA: CPI IS ON DECK TOMORROW, LIKELY

01:40:08 THE BIGGEST. WILL A DECLINE IN YEAR-OVER-YEAR CPI, WHEN YOU

01:40:14 STRIP OUT FOOD AND ENERGY, FALLING TO 3.7% BE SUFFICIENT

01:40:16 TO CUT RATES? MAYBE NOT THIS MONTH BUT MAYBE

01:40:20 IN JUNE. JONATHAN: THAT DATA HAS WHIPSAWED MARKETS

01:40:26 BUT HAS NOT RATTLED THIS FEDERAL RESERVE.

01:40:27 THEY HAVE STAYED ON MESSAGE. CHAIRMAN POWELL HAS NOT CHANGED

01:40:34 HIS MESSAGE FROM JANUARY TO THE SEMIANNUAL TESTIMONY LAST WEEK.

01:40:38 MAYBE A LITTLE BIT ON FINANCIAL REGULATION FOR WHATEVER THAT IS

01:40:40 WORTH, BUT YOU HAVE PEOPLE LIKE GOVERNOR WALLACE SAYING WHAT IS

01:40:43 THE RUSH? THEY ARE UNMOVED BY WHAT WE

01:40:46 HAVE SEEN THE LAST MONTH. LISA: THE MARKET IS FIGHTING BACK.

01:40:54 THE KEY QUESTION IS HOW MUCH THEY KEEP THEIR STATEMENTS OF

01:40:58 ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS THE SAME, AT WHAT POINT DOES THE MARKET

01:40:59 FIGHT BACK MORE?

01:41:07 NO WAIT CUTS THIS YEAR, OR AS SOME SAY, MAYBE THAT IS NOT THE

01:41:08 CASE? JONATHAN:

01:41:14 IN THE SEP, THAT IS WHERE YOU GET THE OUTLOOK FROM THE FED

01:41:15 OFFICIALS. MOST PEOPLE WE HAVE HEARD FROM

01:41:20 SUGGEST THEY WILL BE NO CHANGE IN THAT FROM DECEMBER TO WHERE

01:41:22 WE ARE RIGHT NOW. ANNMARIE: IT'S IMPORTANT NOT JUST FOR

01:41:27 CONSUMERS AND INVESTORS BUT POLITICIANS, ESPECIALLY AS THIS

01:41:31 IS AN ELECTION YEAR. THEY NEED TO KNOW WHERE THE

01:41:37 ECONOMY IS GOING. I LOVE THE COMMENT BIDEN MADE

01:41:39 ON FRIDAY. HE SAYS, I BET YOU RATES ARE

01:41:43 COMING DOWN. PRETTY MUCH WHAT JAY POWELL

01:41:46 SAID ANYWAY.

01:41:54 LISA: I DON'T KNOW WHY HE WOULD EVEN

01:41:56 WEIGH IN ON THIS, THEY WILL CUT RATES. DOES THIS FEATURE IN THE

01:41:59 AMERICAN MIND? JONATHAN:

01:42:05 NO EQUIVALENCE BETWEEN WHAT HE SAID AND THE SAME THING THAT

01:42:06 SENATOR WARREN SAID. THEY ARE NOT THE SAME THING.

01:42:10 WHATEVER. THAT IS WHAT I THOUGHT ABOUT IT

01:42:14 GOING INTO THE WEEKEND. IF THIS IS THE HEIGHT OF

01:42:19 CENTRAL-BANK INTERFERENCE, WE WILL TAKE IT.

01:42:22 THE FEDERAL RESERVE THEMSELVES WOULD TAKE IT.

01:42:28 IF THAT IS FAR AS HE WILL GO, AND IF WE CAN EVEN CHARACTERIZE

01:42:31 THAT AS INTERFERENCE IN CENTRAL-BANK INDEPENDENCE --

01:42:34 LISA: CUTE. JONATHAN: EQUITIES ON THE S&P 500

01:42:39 NEGATIVE BY A THIRD OF 1%. IN THE BOND MARKET, YOU'LL TIRE

01:42:44 BY TWO BASIS POINTS ON THE 2-YEAR. 10'S NOT DOING MUCH.

01:42:51 EURO DOING NOTHING THIS MORNING. 1.03 ON THE CURRENCY PAIR.

01:43:00 WE WILL CATCH UP WITH DAVID SOWERBY.

01:43:09 AARON DAVID MILLER ON BIDEN'S REDLINE FOR ISRAEL.

01:43:14 THE TOP STORY, THE STOCK MARKET RALLY AHEAD OF THE LAST BIT OF

01:43:17 DATA BEFORE NEXT WEEK'S DECISION.

01:43:21 CPI, PPI, RETAIL SALES ON DECK THIS WEEK.

01:43:26 RETAIL SALES SET TO REBOUND, SUPPORTING THE FED'S NO RUSH

01:43:29 CUT VIEW. DAVID SOWERBY OF AND CAR

01:43:33 ADVISORS JOINS US. I WANT TO GO STRAIGHT TO THE

01:43:38 EQUITY MARKETS AND WHY YOU THINK WE MIGHT BE ON THE

01:43:41 PRECIPICE OF A DOWNSIDE HERE, MAYBE SIZABLE SALAFI. DAVID:

01:43:47 IN ANY CALENDAR YEAR, THE AVERAGE INTRIGUE YOUR SELLOFF

01:43:48 IS ABOUT 14%. WE HAVE NOT SEEN ONE IN AT

01:43:53 LEAST NINE MONTHS TO A YEAR. WHILE I THINK THE TONE OF

01:44:01 COMPANIES IS STILL QUITE POSITIVE ESPECIALLY WITH

01:44:02 RESPECT TO THEIR CASH FLOW AND FREE CASH FLOW GROWTH, JUST THE

01:44:05 FACT THAT MORE PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO WEIGH IN THAT THE

01:44:08 FED MAY NOT BE AS AGGRESSIVE AND AS SOON IN REDUCING

01:44:15 INTEREST RATES, THAT COULD BE THE CATALYST THAT SENDS STOCK

01:44:17 PRICES DOWN IN THE NEAR TERM. OUT OF THAT, YOU'LL HAVE AN

01:44:22 OPPORTUNITY TO BUY NAMES THAT ARE DOWN 15% OR MORE. JONATHAN:

01:44:28 I KNOW WHAT LEAD ON THE WAY UP, CAN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT WILL

01:44:29 LEAD ON THE WAY DOWN? DAVID: MARKET DOESN'T LIKE UNCERTAINTY.

01:44:37 WE SAW AT THE END OF LAST OCTOBER, WHEN THE FED SAID GET

01:44:41 BACK IN THE POOL, WE ARE THINKING ABOUT INTEREST RATE

01:44:44 CUTS, MARKETS RESPONDED QUITE WELL.

01:44:46 NOW THAT WE ARE BEGINNING TO SEE SOME NEWS THAT INFLATION IS

01:44:51 NOT QUITE AT THE TAME LEVEL YOU WANT IT TO BE, THAT IS WHAT

01:44:56 COULD POTENTIALLY TAKE THE MARKET DOWN 10%, MAYBE A TOUCH

01:44:58 MORE. LISA: YOU THINK PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED

01:45:03 ABOUT RATES BEING TOO HIGH FOR TOO LONG, STOCKS HAVE NOT WOKEN

01:45:06 UP TO THAT FACT YET, IS THAT CORRECT? DAVID:

01:45:13 I THINK THE MARKET GOT AHEAD OF ITSELF ANTICIPATING, AT ONE

01:45:15 POINT, TALKING ABOUT SIX INTEREST RATE CUTS.

01:45:18 THAT WAS ABSURD, WASN'T GOING TO HAPPEN.

01:45:22 WE KNOW THE MARKET CAN HAVE SOME SCHIZOPHRENIA IN THE NEAR

01:45:25 TERM AND THAT IS MAYBE WHAT IS GOING TO FACE THE MARKET.

01:45:29 BUT LAST WEEK, I WAS AT AN INVESTMENT CONFERENCE.

01:45:32 320 PUBLIC COMPANIES ARE PRESENTING.

01:45:36 I THOUGHT THE TONE WAS QUITE GOOD, B, B-, AND THEY ARE STILL

01:45:40 GENERATING A LOT OF FREE CASH FLOW.

01:45:44 IF YOU GET THIS A LOT, IT WILL BE A BUYING OPPORTUNITY. LISA:

01:45:51 WE JUST HAD KRISHNA MY MONEY ON TALKING ABOUT IT IS NOT A

01:45:54 CONCERN FOR HIM ABOUT REINVESTMENT RISK, STAYING IN

01:45:57 T-BILLS WHEN PEOPLE EXPECT THE FED TO STAY HIGHER FOR LONGER,

01:46:00 AND THERE COULD BE A SELLOFF. IS THAT HOW YOU THINK ABOUT IT

01:46:09 RIGHT NOW, A TIME TO BE IN T-BILLS, WAIT FOR THAT

01:46:10 DOWNDRAFT BEFORE ENTERING? DAVID:

01:46:14 IT GIVES YOU OUTLOOK FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS.

01:46:17 YOU MIGHT GET EXCITED ABOUT A 5% YIELD BUT TO STEP BACK AND

01:46:23 SAY ABSENT A NEAR-TERM HICCUP IN MARKETS, STOCKS STILL

01:46:28 REPRESENT THE BEST PLACE, PARTICULARLY U.S.

01:46:31 STOCKS, IF YOU WANT TO COMPOUND YOUR WILL UP AT 8% OR BETTER.

01:46:35 WE KNOW THE BOND MARKET TO DATE IS FLAT TO DOWN 1% BECAUSE WE

01:46:40 SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN INTEREST RATES GO HIGHER.

01:46:44 I DON'T SEE A LOT OF EXCITEMENT IN THAT WAR CASH. JONATHAN:

01:46:49 HOW RELEVANT IS MONETARY POLICY TO YOUR CALL?

01:46:52 YOU HAVE REFERRED TO IT AS SOME SORT OF BRAND EXPERIENCE.

01:46:56 HOW HAS IT BEEN? DAVID: IT IS AN EXPERIMENT THAT WE ARE

01:47:00 STILL NOT OUT OF THE LABORATORY YET.

01:47:06 WE HAD MONEY GROWTH ACCELERATING 20% YEAR-OVER-YEAR.

01:47:08 IN THE LAST 15 MONTHS, WE HAVE SEEN NEGATIVE INTO MONEY SUPPLY

01:47:11 GROWTH. WE HAVE NOT SEEN THAT IN MORE

01:47:14 THAN 50 YEARS. WE ARE STILL IN THIS MONETARY

01:47:19 EXPERIMENT THAT THE FED PUT US IN OUT OF COVID.

01:47:22 IT WAS GOOD FOR THEM TO BE STIMULATIVE.

01:47:25 THEY SIMPLY STAYED AT THE PARTY TO LONG.

01:47:28 NOW THEY ARE EMBARRASSED AND WE ARE LIVING THROUGH THIS

01:47:32 EXPERIMENT, YET TO BE PLAYED OUT ON INFLATION AND INTEREST

01:47:33 RATES. JONATHAN: AMAZING WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN

01:47:40 FOUR YEARS, RECORD LOW INTEREST RATES, INTEREST RATES AT

01:47:42 MULTI-DECADE HIGHS IN JUST A FEW YEARS.

01:47:46 THE BANKING SECTOR HAS BEEN WHIPSAWED BY THAT, FAILING TO

01:47:49 MANAGE THAT RISK. THAT WAS LAST YEAR'S STORY.

01:47:51 WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE IS CREDIT RISK AROUND THE

01:47:54 CORNER. IS THAT THIS YEAR'S STORY OR

01:47:57 NEXT YEAR? DAVID:

01:48:03 CREDIT RISK IS PROBABLY A YEAR OUT. LOOK AT THE PROPERTY EQUITY

01:48:07 SECTOR THAT IS MORE OF A FLOATING-RATE BORROWER.

01:48:09 THAT IS WHERE THE TROUBLE IS. GOOD COMPANIES, TWO AND A HALF

01:48:15 YEARS AGO, WERT GOOD AT FLOATING THEIR DEBT, EXTENDING

01:48:18 DEBT TRUDGES OUT FURTHER. THAT HAS BEEN QUITE POSITIVE IN

01:48:23 THE FACE OF THIS MONETARY EXPERIMENT.

01:48:28 WHEN IT COMES TO THAT HOLY TRINITY, THE BALANCE SHEET WAS

01:48:29 TOO LONG IGNORED. NOW IT IS FRONT AND CENTER.

01:48:35 COMPANIES HAVE DONE A PRETTY GOOD JOB MANAGING THEIR BALANCE

01:48:36 SHEET AND INTEREST RATE RISK HERE. LISA:

01:48:42 IF MONETARY POLICY WAS AN UNPRECEDENTED EXPERIMENT,

01:48:44 FISCAL POLICY TRY TO RIVAL THAT IN MANY WAYS OVER THE PAST FEW

01:48:45 YEARS. I'M CURIOUS HOW YOU MANEUVER

01:48:51 AROUND A FISCAL POLICY THAT HAS BOLSTERED CERTAIN ASPECTS,

01:48:57 ELECTRIC VEHICLES, INDUSTRIAL STOCKS, WHEN PEOPLE ARE

01:48:58 QUESTIONING HOW THAT WILL PLAY THROUGH.

01:49:01 HOW DO YOU FACTOR THAT IN WHETHER TO DECIDE TO PICK UP

01:49:06 THE PACE IN SOME AREAS THAT HAVE FALLEN OUT RECENTLY? DAVID:

01:49:13 I MIGHT HAVE AN OPINION ON THE FEDERAL RESERVE, GOD FOR BID,

01:49:18 TRY TO FORECAST INTEREST RATES, BUT IN THE 30-STOCK PORTFOLIO I

01:49:23 MANAGE, I'VE ALWAYS OPERATED UNDER EXPECT GOVERNMENT TO DO

01:49:24 THE LEAST AMOUNT TO FIX THE PROBLEM.

01:49:27 THAT HAS PROBABLY BEEN THE BEST RULE FOR MANAGING A PORTFOLIO

01:49:31 IN THE FACE OF WHAT HAS BEEN DISAPPOINTING FISCAL DISCIPLINE.

01:49:34 AND IT WILL CONTINUE. LISA:

01:49:41 YOU ARE SAYING THE INDUSTRIAL POLICY, THE MONEY THAT A LOT OF

01:49:44 PEOPLE SAY ARE GOING INTO DIFFERENT AREAS, THAT IS BEING

01:49:45 OVERPRICED? DAVID: TO SOME EXTENT.

01:49:53 WE SAW IT WITH THE AUTO INDUSTRY, THE EXCITEMENT OVER

01:49:56 ELECTRIC VEHICLES, AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES.

01:50:00 THAT HAS STARTED TO EBB A LITTLE BIT AS PEOPLE STILL WANT

01:50:02 THEIR INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE.

01:50:05 PICKING THE WINNERS AND LOSERS IN INDUSTRIAL POLICY, IT ALWAYS

01:50:08 SOUNDS GOOD AT THE BEGINNING. YOU LOOK AT IT AFTER THE

01:50:16 OUTCOME, AND MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, GOVERNMENT HAS NOT DONE A

01:50:17 GOOD JOB PICKING THE WINNERS AND LOSERS AS OPPOSED TO THE

01:50:19 MARKETPLACE AND MILLIONS OF INVESTORS EVERY DAY THAT VOTE

01:50:22 WITH THEIR DOLLARS. JONATHAN: CENTRAL PLANNING NEVER ENDS

01:50:25 WELL. DAVID SOWERBY, THANK YOU FOR

01:50:28 YOUR TIME. LET'S GET YOU AN UPDATE ON

01:50:31 OTHER STORIES. HERE IS YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF.

01:50:37 YAHAIRA: COMMERCE SECRETARY GINA RAIMONDO SAYS THE U.S.

01:50:39 COULD FURTHER TIGHTEN CONTROLS ON CHINA'S ACCESS TO CHIP

01:50:40 TECHNOLOGY. SHE TOLD REPORTERS WE CANNOT

01:50:46 ALLOW CHINA TO HAVE ACCESS FOR THEIR BLITZ EVERY ADVANCEMENTS

01:50:49 TO OUR MOST SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGY. SHE ADDED THE U.S.

01:50:54 WILL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO KEEP CHINESE FIRM FROM

01:50:56 ACCESSING U.S. CHIP INFORMATION. HER COMMENTS COME AS THE BIDEN

01:51:01 ADMINISTRATION WAYS OF SANCTIONS ON SEVERAL CHINESE

01:51:04 COMPANIES IN ORDER TO CURB THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEMICONDUCTORS.

01:51:08 AT LEAST 50 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INJURED AFTER A MIDAIR INCIDENT

01:51:17 ON A LET HIM FLIGHT F WHICH CAUSED STRONG MOVEMENTS ON

01:51:19 BOARD. A DOZEN PEOPLE ON BOARD WERE

01:51:24 TAKEN TO HOSPITAL INCLUDING ONE PATIENT IN SERIOUS CONDITION.

01:51:30 OPPENHEIMER PICKED UP A TOTAL OF SEVEN ACADEMY AWARDS

01:51:31 INCLUDING BEST PICTURE AND BEST DIRECTOR.

01:51:36 BARBIE'S EIGHT NOMINATIONS AMOUNTED TO ONE TROPHY FOR BEST

01:51:41 SONG, AND A NIGHT THAT SAW HOLLYWOOD'S OLD GUARD RETURN TO

01:51:43 GLORY AMID DISAPPOINTMENT FOR STREAMING COMPANIES.

01:51:54 POOR THINGS SAW EMMA STONE WHEN IN THE AWARD FOR BEST ACTRESS.

01:51:57 THAT IS YOUR BLOOMBERG BRIEF. JONATHAN:

01:52:00 ROBERT DOWNEY JUNIOR WAS SO GOOD IN THAT MOVIE.

01:52:05 SO GOOD, I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT THAT IT WAS HIM UNTIL THE END.

01:52:08 LISA: HE WAS SUCH A GOOD ACTOR.

01:52:15 IT IS A FANTASTIC MOVIE, REALLY WAS, FROM A DRAMATIC

01:52:17 PERSPECTIVE AND ALSO PHILOSOPHICAL PERSPECTIVE.

01:52:19 JONATHAN: WELL-DESERVED. I KNOW EVERYONE LIKES TO FRAME

01:52:28 THE OSCARS IN SOME LEFT-WING THEORY, BUT OPPENHEIMER WAS

01:52:30 JUST THE BEST MOVIE, HANDS DOWN. LISA:

01:52:33 DO PEOPLE THINK THAT BARBIE SHOULD HAVE WON INSTEAD?

01:52:37 I HAVE SEEN BOTH. JONATHAN: SOME PEOPLE DO.

01:52:46 NEXT ON THE PROGRAM, BIDEN'S REDLINE FOR ISRAEL.

01:52:50 PRESIDENT BIDEN: THERE IS NO REDLINE I WANT TO

01:52:56 CUT OF ALL WEAPONS, BUT YOU CANNOT HAVE 30,000 MORE

01:52:57 PALESTINIANS DEAD. JONATHAN: THAT CONVERSATION UP NEXT.

01:53:06 ♪

01:53:22 JONATHAN: SESSION LOWS ON THE S&P 500,

01:53:25 NEGATIVE BY 0.5%. NVIDIA WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE

01:53:29 ON FRIDAY SUCCESSION. POSITIVE 5%, -5%.

01:53:35 THE STOCK IS DOWN BY ANOTHER .8%. LISA:

01:53:39 WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE VOLATILITY?

01:53:42 IS THERE A SIGNAL THERE OR IS IT JUST ALL NOISE? JONATHAN:

01:53:44 HARD TO SAY. ALL I CAN SAY IS WE HAVE HAD A

01:53:50 MONSTER RUN UP INTO FRIDAY. SIX DAYS, 19%.

01:53:56 20% AND A COUPLE TRILLION IS A LOT OF MONEY. LISA:

01:54:01 WE ARE TALKING HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON MARKET

01:54:03 CAPITALIZATION GAINED OR LOST LIKE THAT.

01:54:06 HOW DOES THAT WORK GOING FORWARD IF THAT HAS BEEN ONE OF

01:54:09 THE MAIN DRIVERS OF THE S&P 500? JONATHAN:

01:54:12 THAT IS THE MODERN-DAY MARKET IN 2024.

01:54:15 IN THE BOND MARKET, HIGHER BY TWO BASIS POINTS.

01:54:20 2-YEAR AROUND 4.50. UNDER SURVEILLANCE THIS

01:54:25 MORNING, BIDEN'S REDLINE FOR ISRAEL. PRESIDENT BIDEN:

01:54:30 THERE IS NO REDLINE THAT I WANT TO CUT OFF ALL WEAPONS SO THEY

01:54:35 DON'T HAVE THE IRON DONME TO PROTECT THEM BUT YOU CANNOT

01:54:39 HAVE 30,000 MORE PALESTINIANS DEAD AS A CONSEQUENCE OF GOING

01:54:43 AFTER THEM. THERE IS ANOTHER WAY TO DEAL

01:54:46 WITH THE DRAMA CAUSED BY HAMAS. JONATHAN:

01:54:50 PRESIDENT BIDEN SLINGING HIS HARSHEST CRITICISM YET AS IS

01:54:58 REALLY PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU, DIVISION GROWING

01:55:00 OVER THE NEXT PHASE OF THE WAR, AS BOTH SIDES FAILED TO REACH

01:55:02 ANY AGREEMENT ON A CEASE-FIRE BEFORE RAMADAN.

01:55:06 AARON DAVID MILLER JOINS US NOW FOR MORE.

01:55:09 THANKS FOR BEING WITH US. DO YOU BELIEVE THERE IS A REAL

01:55:14 SPLIT TAKING PLACE BETWEEN THESE LEADERS OR IS THIS A

01:55:17 CONVENIENT MEDIA NARRATIVE TO BENEFIT THE PRESIDENT HERE

01:55:20 DOMESTICALLY AARON: I THINK IT'S REAL.

01:55:22 ANGER AND FRUSTRATION ON THE PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION IS

01:55:24 GROWING. I DON'T THINK WE ARE ON THE

01:55:27 CUSP OF A BREACH. THE PROBLEM IS WITH NO HOSTAGE

01:55:34 OR PRISONER RELEASE DEAL, A DYNAMIC IS LADY THREADBARE FOR

01:55:35 ALL TO SEE. HAMAS IS USING TUNNELS AND TIME

01:55:40 TO CREATE PRESSURES INSIDE ISRAEL AND EXTERNALLY FROM THE

01:55:45 UNITED STATES ON THE NETANYAHU GOVERNMENT.

01:55:48 BENJAMIN NETANYAHU IS DETERMINED TO PURSUE AN

01:55:54 OPERATION IN ROUGH -- RAFAH TO DESTROY TUNNELS AND WHERE HE

01:55:56 BELIEVES THE SENIOR HAMAS LEADERSHIP IS. IT'S VERY REAL.

01:56:01 THE QUESTION IS CAN IT BE MANAGED?

01:56:05 THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO MAKE A DECISION WHETHER HE WANTS TO

01:56:06 MAKE A POINT OR MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

01:56:10 IF HE WANTS TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE, I'M NOT SURE IF HE

01:56:14 HAS MUCH CHOICE TO WORK WITH THE ISRAELIS.

01:56:19 WITHOUT IS REALLY ACQUIESCENCE, THIS WILL GO ON AND ON.

01:56:24 IT HAS ALREADY TAKEN A TOLL ON THE PRESIDENT'S ELECTION

01:56:25 PROSPECTS. ANNMARIE: DID HE ACTUALLY CREATE A

01:56:28 REDLINE? HE SAID AFTER THERE IS A

01:56:34 REDLINE WHEN IT COMES TO GAZA, HE SAID HE STILL SUPPORTS

01:56:35 ISRAEL. THEY WILL NOT TRY TO TAKE AWAY

01:56:38 ANY WEAPONS. THE WALL STREET JOURNAL SAID,

01:56:42 AS IS OFTEN THE CASE, IT IS HARD TO TELL WHAT MR. BIDEN

01:56:50 MEANS. AARON:

01:56:51 AMERICAN LINES OFTEN TURN PINK WHEN IT COMES TO ISRAEL.

01:56:56 JOE BIDEN HAS A PROFOUND COMMITMENT EMOTIONALLY,

01:57:00 POLITICALLY TO THE IDEA, PEOPLE OF ISRAEL, SECURITY OF ISRAEL,

01:57:03 NOT SO MUCH OF THE NETANYAHU GOVERNMENT.

01:57:07 BY THE SAME TOKEN, HE IS WATCHING A FEW MILITARY

01:57:11 DISASTER IN GAZA, WHERE THE ISRAELIS COULD CLEARLY DO MORE

01:57:12 TO FACILITATE THAT. AND AGAIN, WE ARE REACHING A

01:57:15 POINT.

01:57:22 IF TUNNELS AND TIME WORKS TO THEIR ADVANTAGE, THE ISRAELIS

01:57:26 WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE THEIR OPERATION, AND THAT WILL LEAD

01:57:29 TO A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF PALESTINIAN CASUALTIES.

01:57:34 I THINK WE ARE IN FOR A BAD PATCH IN U.S.-ISRAELI

01:57:38 RELATIONSHIPS, BUT NOT IN FOR A BREAKUP. ANNMARIE:

01:57:43 TALKING ABOUT A COME TO JESUS MEETING WITH BENJAMIN NETANYAHU.

01:57:46 DO YOU EXPECT PRESIDENT
