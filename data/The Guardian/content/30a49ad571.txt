The organizers of a women’s running race in Spain has apologised after the winner was offered a food processor to take home, something that has sparked accusations of sexism.

The 7km Carrera de la Mujer issued a statement on Twitter saying it hadn’t considered the kitchen appliance – donated by a sponsor – would have sexist implications.

“We apologise but we consider this a product with no sexist character and ideal for any athlete who wants to improve their nutritional habits,” the statement said. “We regret if any woman felt offended.” The organisers promised to “take measures” to avoid similar incidents in the future.

Serbia’s Ivana Zagorac won the race, which took place in Madrid and had 32,000 entrants. The race took place on Mother’s Day in Spain, and supported domestic violence and cancer survivors. It is also held in other cities across Spain.

The choice of prize went largely unnoticed until Ángela Rodríguez, Spain’s secretary of state for equality, tweeted that the winner had received a food processor and others were given 0% fat products. “If you win: housewife and if not at least you’ll lose weight,” Rodríguez tweeted.

The race has previously featured T-shirts with the slogan: “Today, the girls win!”
