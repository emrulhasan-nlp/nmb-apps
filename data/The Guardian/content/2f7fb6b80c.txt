Braverman suggests liberalism and support of immigration are “luxury beliefs”. She says:

I know there are some who think that emphasising the importance of law and order or secure borders, is unedifying.

They look down on those of us who care about such things.

Of course, they are entitled to their beliefs.

But let’s be honest.

These are luxury beliefs.

What do I mean by that?

Our politically correct critics have money. They have status. And they have loud voices.

They have the luxury of promoting seductive but irresponsible ideas safe in the knowledge that their privilege will insulate them from any collateral damage.

The luxury beliefs brigade sit in their ivory towers telling ordinary people that they are morally deficient because they dare to get upset about the impact of illegal migration, net zero, or habitual criminals.

And you can be sure of one thing.

People with luxury beliefs will flock to Labour at the next election because that’s the way to get the kind of society they want.

They like open borders. The migrants coming in won’t be taking their jobs. In fact, they are more likely to have them mowing their lawns or cleaning their homes.

They love soft sentences. The criminals who benefit from such ostentatious compassion won’t be terrorising their streets or grooming their children.

They are desperate to reverse Brexit. They think patriotism is embarrassing and have no use for a British passport if it doesn’t entitle them to live in their second homes in Tuscany, Dordogne or Barcelona.

For these people, I have a simple message … You are entitled to your luxury beliefs, but the British people will no longer pay for them.
