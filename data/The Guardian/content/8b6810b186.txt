From 5 Feb 2024 11.18 GMT At least six members of US-backed Kurdish-led group killed in drone strike in Syria – reports In the first significant attack in Syria or Iraq since the US launched strikes over the weekend against Iran-backed militias that have been targeting its forces in the region, six allied Kurdish fighters were killed late Sunday by a drone attack on a base also housing US troops in eastern Syria. Associated Press reports the US-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said Monday the attack hit a training ground at al-Omar base in Syria’s eastern province of Deir el-Zour, where the forces’ commando units are trained. No casualties were reported among US troops. The SDF initially accused “Syrian regime-backed mercenaries” of carrying out Sunday’s attack but in a second statement blamed “Iran-backed militias” after investigating the attack. An umbrella group of Iran-backed Iraqi militias, dubbed the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, released a video claiming responsibility and showing them launching a drone from an unspecified location. Iraq and Syria share 600km (370m) of border. Britain-based opposition war monitor Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claimed at least seven SDF fighters were killed in the attack on Sunday, and at least 18 others wounded, some in critical condition. The SDF said it has the right to respond to the attack. The US strikes on Saturday came after three of its service personnel were killed in a drone strike on a US base in Jordan on 27 January. Two US defense officials told CNN at the weekend that during those strikes “all but one of the 85 targets were ‘destroyed or functionally damaged’”. Share

US secretary of state Antony Blinken arrived in Saudi Arabia on his fifth visit to the region since October in the coming hours. He will visit Israel as well as Egypt and Qatar. Speaking Monday after meeting in Washington with Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Blinken said there was “real hope” for success of a “good, strong [ceasefire] proposal”. Jake Sullivan , president Joe Biden’s national security adviser, said Blinken would press Israel to allow more food, water, medicine and shelter in to Gaza, which has been left in rubble by nearly four months of bombardment.

In its latest operational update the Israeli military claims it has killed “dozens of terrorists” in the central and northern Gaza Strip in the last 24 hours. Palestinian news agency Wafa reports that Israeli bombardment continues in Khan Younis , with large areas east of the city of Deir al-Balah also being targeted. At least 20 Palestinians were killed over the weekend in Israeli strikes on Rafah , the city previously designated a safe zone by the Israeli military and to where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had fled, according to the UN agency humanitarian agency OCHA.

The Palestine Red Crescent Society has reported on social media that Israeli forces have detained the general manager and the administrative director of the Al-Amal hospital in Khan Younis .

A 14-year-old Palestinian child was shot dead by Israeli security forces near occupied East Jerusalem after what they claimed was an attempted stabbing attack.

Spain will send the UN Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA an additional €3.5m (£3m / $3.8m) in aid, foreign minister José Manuel Albares told lawmakers on Monday. The agency has warned of a significant funding shortfall after several large donors suspended funding after Israel accused 12 UNRWA employees of participating in the 7 October Hamas attack inside southern Israel.

Russia summoned Israel’s ambassador in Moscow over comments Simona Halperin made in an interview. She had criticised Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov for playing down the importance of the Holocaust and said Russia was being too friendly with Hamas. Share

5 Feb 2024 13.44 GMT US secretary of state Antony Blinken has arrived in Saudi Arabia, Reuters reports. In Riyadh, Blinken is expected to meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as well as his Saudi counterpart, foreign minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud. It is Blinken’s fifth visit to the region since the 7 October attack by Hamas inside southern Israel. Blinken is also set to visit Egypt, Qatar and Israel later this week in an attempt to secure a pause in fighting that will allow hostages to be released. Hamas is believed to still have about 136 people in captivity in Gaza, not all of whom are believed to still be alive. In recent days the US has carried out strikes inside Syria, Iraq and Yemen on targets it says are Iran-backed militants. In July 2022, US president Joe Biden visited Saudi Arabia, and said afterwards he told the crown prince that he held him personally responsible for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. The Biden administration later ruled that the crown prince enjoyed head-of-state immunity from any decision by an American court on the murder of the journalist, who had been living in exile in the US before his death.

5 Feb 2024 09.44 GMT Al Jazeera has a report from Mohammed R Mhawish who has remained in Gaza City with his family throughout the Israeli assault on the territory. He writes: My family – father, mother, sister, wife, and two-year-old son – and I are seeking relative refuge in the parking garage of a destroyed apartment building. On rainy nights, I take off my coat and wrap it around my baby, making it both a blanket and protection for him against the cold, with hope and prayer that it will be enough for his small body. Beyond shelter is the struggle for food. I cannot recall the last proper meal my son had. Wheat is nowhere to be found so we have been using animal feed-grade barley and corn to grind into flour for bread. If you secure food, you still have to cook it and, with no cooking gas, people are combing the ruins to find anything they can burn for a cooking fire, exposing themselves to bombing at any time. And so, when every hour of the day is spent either looking for food or a means to make it, we cannot always worry about staying safe. Share

5 Feb 2024 08.33 GMT In Russia, Tass reports that “the Israeli ambassador will be summoned to the Russian foreign ministry in connection with unacceptable public statements.” Reuters notes that in an interview in Russia’s Kommersant, published on Sunday, Simona Halperin criticised Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov for playing down the importance of the Holocaust and said Russia was being too friendly with Hamas.

Hamas subsequently released two Russian-Israeli dual nationals it had seized from southern Israel as hostages, under a separate hostage release agreement negotiated between Hamas and Russia. The ministry described Halperin’s comments as “an extremely unsuccessful start” to her diplomatic posting, which began last December. Share
