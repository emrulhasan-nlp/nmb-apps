From 7 Mar 2024 11.49 GMT Hamas confirms ceasefire talks continue, despite delegation leaving Cairo and official saying Israel 'thwarted' deal A Hamas statement has confirmed that talks over a deal with Israel will continue, despite a Hamas delegation leaving Cairo where talks were being held, and a senior Hamas official claiming that Israel had “thwarted” any deal. “Hamas’s delegation left Cairo this morning for consultation with the leadership of the movement, with negotiations and efforts continuing to stop the aggression, return the displaced and bring in relief aid to our people,” Reuters reports Hamas statement said. Earlier, official Sami Abu Zuhri told the news agency Israel had been “thwarting” efforts to conclude a ceasefire deal mediated by Qatar and Egypt during the four days of talks hosted in Cairo. Abu Zuhri told Reuters that Israel was rejecting Hamas’s demands to end its offensive in the territory, withdraw its forces, and ensure freedom of entry for aid and the return of displaced people. There was no immediate comment from Israel, which is demanding the release of about 134 hostages still believed to be kept inside Gaza. Not all of them are thought to be alive. Hamas pledged to continue the Cairo talks, but officials said a ceasefire must be in place before hostages are freed, Israeli forces must leave Gaza and all Gazans must be able to return to homes they have fled, many of which have been destroyed during five months of intense aerial bombardment of the Gaza Strip by Israel. Reports had said Israel was staying away from the Cairo talks because Hamas refused to provide a list of hostages who are still alive. Hamas says this is impossible without a ceasefire first, as hostages are scattered across Gaza. Share

7 Mar 2024 15.09 GMT Summary of the day … It has just gone 5pm in Gaza, Cairo, Beirut and Tel Aviv. Here are the latest headlines … A Hamas statement has confirmed that talks over a deal with Israel will continue, despite a Hamas delegation leaving Cairo where talks were being held, and a senior Hamas official claiming that Israel had “thwarted” any deal. Official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters that Israel had been “thwarting” efforts to conclude a ceasefire deal mediated by Qatar and Egypt during the four days of talks, rejecting Hamas’s demands to end its offensive in the territory, withdraw its forces, and ensure freedom of entry for aid and the return of displaced people.

Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer said “it is Hamas who is the stumbling block right now by not telling us who is alive and who they have in their custody”. Separately an Israeli official told the CNN network it believes Hamas is playing a “game”, and that the group does know where hostages are being held.

At least 30,800 Palestinians have been killed and 72,298 have been wounded since Israel began its military assault on Gaza after the 7 October Hamas attack inside Israel, according to the latest figures from the health ministry. In addition, the Palestinian Authority ministry of health – which is separate to the Hamas-led one that operates inside Gaza – says that 424 Palestinians have now been killed by Israeli security forces or settlers in the Israeli-occupied West Bank since 7 October.

It claims in the last 24 hours to have located “weapons manufacturing facility, explosive devices and military equipment” as well as having “dismantled command centers used by terror organizations in the Gaza Strip”.

Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel will push on with its offensive in Gaza, including in Rafah, regardless of international pressure. Israel’s prime minister said “There is international pressure and it’s growing, but particularly when the international pressure rises, we must close ranks, we need to stand together against the attempts to stop the war.”

The health ministry in Gaza said Israel on Thursday returned 47 bodies of Palestinians it had killed earlier during the military offensive. Images appeared to show a mass gave being prepared near where people are sheltering in makeshift tent camps in Rafah .

Israel ’s foreign minister, Israel Katz , is reported to have instructed diplomats to push calls for the UN to declare Hamas a terrorist organisation in the wake of a UN report on sexual violence occurring during and after the 7 October attacks inside southern Israel.

Turkey ’s Red Crescent is sending its biggest aid shipment yet to Gaza via Egypt, with a ship carrying about 3,000 tons of food, medicine and equipment leaving for the Egyptian port of Al-Arish.

The IDF has said that it struck on Thursday at what it described as two Hezbollah outposts inside Lebanon .

Lior Haiat , spokesperson for Israel’s foreign affairs ministry, has accused South Africa of acting “as the legal arm of Hamas in an attempt to undermine Israel’s inherent right to defend itself and its citizens, and to release all of the hostages”. South Africa has been pressing the international court of justice in The Hague to order Israel into a ceasefire.

Three crew members of the True Confidence dry bulk carrier were killed in a missile attack off Yemen on Wednesday, the owners and manager of the ship confirmed in a statement on Thursday. Two other crew members sustained serious injuries. The ship is drifting away from land and salvage arrangements are being made.

Russia ’s Federal Security Service said it prevented an attack on a synagogue in Moscow that was plotted by an Islamic State cell.

Malaysia’s prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, has criticised the west for its attitude to the situation in Gaza during a speech in Australia. He said the west had been “so vociferous, vehement and unequivocal in the condemnation of the Russian invasion of Ukraine” but “utterly silent on the relentless blood-letting inflicted on innocent men, women and children of Gaza”. Anwar said it would foolish to think these inconsistencies would “go unnoticed”. We are closing this live blog now. You can find all of the latest on the Israel-Gaza war here. Share

7 Mar 2024 15.07 GMT At the Kerem Shalom border crossing today an attempt by the Standing Together movement to deliver aid to Gaza appears to have been blocked. The convoy, consisting of numerous vehicles with banners proclaiming “No to starvation,” was en route to the border when it encountered a halt at the police checkpoint near the border gate. Co-director of the Jewish-Arab movement which campaigns for peace, equality & social justice in Israel, Alon-Lee Green, posted to social media saying: In the very minutes that the police and the army block us – 10 minutes from the border with Gaza with an aid and food convoy – a group of settlers are allowed to be at the border itself and completely prevent the transfer of food and aid to millions of people who are starving. This proves that there is an official policy of starvation, a policy of eternal war in which we will all lose. זה לא פחות מדהים. ממש בדקות שאותנו המשטרה והצבא חוסמים - 10 דקות מהגבול עם עזה עם שיירת סיוע ואוכל - לחבורת המתנחלים מאפשרים להיות בגבול עצמו ולמנוע לגמרי העברה של אוכל וסיוע למיליוני אנשים שגוועים ברעב.

His 19-year-old son, Nimrod Cohen, was stationed along the border when he was kidnapped during the 7 October attacks by Hamas, and Cohen told reporters at the event: If 134 hostages will be marched from Gaza back to Israel, suffering from both sides will stop. What we want, after 153 days, 22 weeks, 5 months, to bring all our loved ones back home, we know he’s alive there. He wasn’t there to harm anyone, he was there to defend, he was an innocent boy. Hamas took innocent children, innocent women and kidnapped them just for the spite of it, and we want them all back home.

7 Mar 2024 13.43 GMT IDF chief of staff publishes letter to commanders on process of reviewing conduct during war Describing a review of Israeli military performance as a “lever that allows for improvement after failure”, the IDF chief of the general staff has issued a letter to commanders about a review process to assess performance during a war which it says began with “a difficult start”. The letter, published openly by the IDF, starts: The “Swords of Iron” War began with a surprise that resulted in a difficult outcome and a significant loss of civilian and soldier lives. Since then, the IDF has been defending and striking successfully and effectively - we had a difficult start, we recovered and we are making significant progress.



Reviews hold an honorable place in our military values. They are the lever that allows for improvement after failure, a way to be better after success, the tool with which a unit can build itself a climbing route that will elevate it indefinitely.



Just as charging in the face of enemy fire requires strength and courage, holding ourselves accountable and facing reviews also requires bravery and leadership. The letter appeals to IDF troops for “honesty” in the review, stating that “when dealing with complex situations, it is critical to explore and make decisions that allow for evaluation and learning.” The letter concedes that the review will not be able to “thoroughly examine every step, every bullet fired”. It also laments that “some of our people are no longer here with us, and we will not be able to hear their point of view.” It concludes “Just as I trust the IDF’s ability to fight well, I believe each of us has the ability to ask questions in an unassuming, but constructive manner. This is how we’ll learn, and this is how we will better defend Israeli civilians in the future.” Share

7 Mar 2024 13.14 GMT An Israeli official has told the CNN news network that it believes Hamas is playing a “game”, and that the group does know where hostages are being held in the Gaza Strip, despite insisting on a ceasefire before it can compile and give the information. “I think they do know, it’s a game,” the official said, claiming that both Israel and Hamas have “intelligence” on where the remaining abductees are being held. Reportedly the failure of Hamas to give Israel a precise list of which hostages are being held has been a stumbling block in efforts to get them released. Hamas official Basem Naim has previously said “There is no way to know the fate” of captives until a ceasefire is implemented. Share

7 Mar 2024 12.16 GMT Lior Haiat, spokesperson for Israel’s foreign affairs ministry, has accused South Africa of acting “as the legal arm of Hamas in an attempt to undermine Israel’s inherent right to defend itself and its citizens, and to release all of the hostages”. In a statement posted on social media, he said “the repeated requests for provisional measures made by South Africa in order to assist Hamas are yet another cynical exploitation of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which has already twice rejected the baseless attempts to deny Israel its right and obligation of self-defence”. South Africa continues to act as the legal arm of Hamas in an attempt to undermine Israel’s inherent right to defend itself and its citizens, and to release all of the hostages.
