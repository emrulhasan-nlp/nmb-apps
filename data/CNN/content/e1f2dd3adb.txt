Megan Rapinoe has played her last professional match.

The 38-year-old bid farewell during a 2-1 loss to Gotham FC in the NWSL Championship on Saturday, November 11. Rapinoe exited the game with an injury in the opening minutes.

Since making her international debut in 2006, Rapinoe has gone on to become an Olympic gold medalist and two-time Women's World Cup winner. She was described by US Soccer as "one of the most impactful figures in the history of soccer in the United States and in the global women's game."

Off the field, Rapinoe is known for her work on social issues, including gender and pay equity, LGBTQ+ rights and racial inequality.

Rapinoe played in her fourth and final World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. The Americans were eliminated in the round of 16 after a penalty shootout with Sweden.
