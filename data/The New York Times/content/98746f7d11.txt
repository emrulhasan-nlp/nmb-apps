The Rev. C. Welton Gaddy, who started his career in the Southern Baptist Convention but became increasingly troubled as the denomination grew more aggressively conservative, and who went on to lead the Interfaith Alliance, an organization devoted to religious and cultural diversity and to keeping religion and politics separate, died on June 7 in Monroe, La. He was 81.

Northminster Church of Monroe, where Dr. Gaddy was senior pastor from 1991 until his retirement in 2016, posted news of his death on its Facebook page, saying he had been having serious health issues for several months. The Interfaith Alliance, of which he was president from 1997 to 2014, also noted his death on its website.

“Across so many areas,” the group’s president and chief executive, the Rev. Paul Brandeis Raushenbush, said in that post, “Welton used his platform to project a vision for America that was inclusive of different beliefs and respectful of every individual’s inherent dignity.”

Dr. Gaddy, while leading congregations in several Southern states, held various posts in the Southern Baptist Convention in the 1970s and the first half of the ’80s, including serving on its executive committee from 1980 to 1984. But although he seemed to be a rising star in the denomination during this period, he was often at odds with its emerging conservatism, which was largely being orchestrated by the strategists Paul Pressler and Paige Patterson. Mr. Pressler and Mr. Patterson were on the warpath over what they perceived as liberal trends in doctrine and were putting like-minded people in positions of power.
