State courts in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota and elsewhere have so far declined to rule in favor of challenges asserting that Donald Trump should be disqualified from holding the presidency again under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. (Cases in Michigan and Colorado have been appealed.)

Challengers assert that Mr. Trump is barred because, as stated in Section 3, he was an officer of the United States who, after taking an oath to support the Constitution, “engaged in insurrection or rebellion against” the country or gave “aid or comfort to the enemies thereof” before and during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.

Mr. Trump and his campaign have called this claim an absurd conspiracy theory and labeled efforts to bar him as election interference. Some election officials and legal scholars — many of them otherwise opposed to the former president — have also been critical of the efforts.

The Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, writes that invoking Section 3 “is merely the newest way of attempting to short-circuit the ballot box.” Michael McConnell, a former judge and a professor at Stanford Law School, claims that keeping Mr. Trump off the ballot on grounds that are “debatable at best is not something that will be regarded as legitimate.”
