Legislation like Florida’s Parental Rights in Education Act—known by critics as the “Don’t Say Gay” law—and increased attempts to ban books censor discussions on sexuality and gender identity with young people. But many kids today are growing up with queer parents and other extended family members, as well as in communities with queer families and classmates. Silencing basic information prevents them from understanding their world, fictionalizes reality for all kids—and further erases those who are LGBTQ.

I would know. In 1993, my school district drew nationwide attention for removing and banning Annie on My Mind—one of the first young adult novels about two girls who fall in love—at a time when I was beginning to struggle with my own identity. Reading books about LGBTQ life and identity shows all children how others live, while also holding up a mirror for some kids to see themselves, said Nicole Champoux, a Montessori school administrator and teacher in Washington state. And today there are hundreds of age-appropriate children’s books exploring queer families, history, gender expression, and more.

But for those of us who grew up in eras when those books didn’t exist—or in communities where they weren’t yet accessible—it can be hard to know where to start in choosing books for our own kids. We asked Champoux, as well as a dozen other queer librarians, educators, and booksellers, for their reading recommendations for kids of all ages. Here are their picks, along with options to support independent, queer-owned bookstores.
