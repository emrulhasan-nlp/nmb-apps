In Los Angeles, a Muslim organization condemned public school officials for “not acknowledging the dispossession of the Palestinian people,” after a “We Stand With Israel” message was posted on the district’s official website.

And in New York, public school leaders have released a wide-ranging patchwork of memos that have often prompted the same response from different factions of parents and teachers: outrage.

Over the past two weeks, American public school districts have wrestled with the dilemma of how — and whether — to respond to the Hamas attack on Israel and the subsequent Israeli bombardment of Gaza, which together have killed thousands of civilians. A restrained email with a list of counseling resources? A lengthier letter that denounces the attackers or delves into the region’s history? Or, say nothing at all?

For ethnically and religiously diverse districts, it can be a daunting calculation. But as the war continues and a rise in threats against both Jewish and Muslim Americans stirs fear, addressing the crisis could become unavoidable — and more complicated — for schools.
