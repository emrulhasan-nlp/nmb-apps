I’ve been traveling the country speaking to corporate executives about seismic shifts in higher education: a demographic cliff, decreased state funding, ever-rising tuition and a recent poll showing that over half of Americans don’t believe college is worth the cost. And, of course, the Supreme Court’s decision on affirmative action, which was handed down on Thursday, banning the use of race in college admissions.

If you haven’t connected the dots for how this will affect your organizations, it’s time to wake up, I have been warning them. For decades, companies in America have relied on colleges and universities to deliver a diverse and well-prepared work force. That gravy train is officially over.

The executives often express shock. Recently, a leader at a Fortune 500 company wanted to know — as many others have asked — what higher education was going to do about it.

The real question, I told her, is: What are you going to do about it?

America’s corporations count on having a diverse, well-prepared work force that knows how to work well with all different kinds of people. That’s why 82 major employers, including Google, Apple, General Electric, Mastercard, Meta, General Motors and Verizon, submitted amicus briefs to the Supreme Court in support of race-conscious policies in college admissions.
