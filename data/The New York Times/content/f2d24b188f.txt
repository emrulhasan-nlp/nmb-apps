A GREAT DISORDER: National Myth and the Battle for America, by Richard Slotkin

“A patriot is not a weapon,” Adrienne Rich wrote in a 1991 poem. “A patriot is one who wrestles for the soul of her country/as she wrestles for her own being.” The historian Richard Slotkin uses these words as an epigraph for his sweeping new work, “A Great Disorder,” his effort to redeem nationalism from its violent and exclusionary politics through an exploration of Americans’ ideas about their country. His book is the culmination of a prolific career and a new way to make sense not only of the past, but of the contemporary culture wars.

Across three books of U.S. history — “Regeneration Through Violence,” about the period from 1600 to the Civil War; “The Fatal Environment,” about industrialization in the 1800s; and “Gunfighter Nation,” about imperial ambitions in the 20th century — Slotkin argued that Americans repeatedly turned to what he called the “myth of the frontier,” a notion that reinvention could be achieved only through the white supremacist violence of Indigenous displacement and fatal shootouts. The results were environmental degradation and capitalist exploitation.

An American iconography developed. The idea of the cowboy, the wilderness explorer and the fertile but deadly frontier landscape consumed the white American imagination, inspiring late-19th-century prospectors who hunted for coal and oil in Texas and Oklahoma as well as John F. Kennedy, who invoked the “opportunities and perils” of a “new frontier” to call for bold economic and civil reforms at home while waging brutal Cold War battles abroad.

Having interpreted 400 years of American history through this lens, Slotkin now turns his attention to the 21st century. Distressed by the division and dysfunction that have come to define U.S. politics, especially since the election of Donald Trump in 2016, he looks again to the motives we find in the stories we tell.
