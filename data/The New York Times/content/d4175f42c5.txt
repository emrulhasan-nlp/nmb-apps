New York City’s official Pride theme this year is Strength in Solidarity, an apt reminder that Pride was born as a protest movement against bigotry wherever it manifests. Not that there isn’t room to party, too.

The actor and singer Billy Porter and the activist Randy Wicker are among the grand marshals of this year’s Pride March, which kicks off at noon on June 25 at 25th Street and 5th Avenue. (It will be broadcast on ABC 7.) Also that day, Christina Aguilera headlines Pride Island, the big annual dance party, at Brooklyn Army Terminal.

New York’s official Pride calendar also features a Juneteenth brunch with Black L.G.B.T.Q. chefs on June 18 and, on June 24, events centered on people of color and a Youth Pride party.

Other area Pride marches and festivals will be held in the Hudson Valley (June 3); Queens (June 4); Brooklyn (June 10); Long Island (June 11); the Bronx (June 17); and Harlem (June 24). The annual Dyke March — “a protest march, not a parade,” according to organizers — is June 24.
