The writer and producer Norman Lear, who died on Tuesday at 101, got his start in television in the 1950s, selling jokes and sketches to comedians like Jerry Lewis. After dabbling in film as a screenwriter and a director, Lear — already approaching his 50s — found unlikely success and a new career path when he convinced CBS to take a chance on his sitcom “All in the Family” in 1971. Though the show was based on the British series “Till Death Us Do Part,” Lear made his version distinctly American and of the moment, bringing spirited arguments about race, class, religion, politics and the generation gap into living rooms across the country.

When “All in the Family” became a phenomenon, Lear and his colleagues started producing spinoffs and similar series, filling the airwaves throughout the 1970s with critically acclaimed and high-rated shows about families from varied ethnic and economic backgrounds.

Lear’s golden touch dimmed by the end of the decade, as the audience’s tastes changed. But he’s still regularly cited as an influence and even sometimes as a direct mentor by TV writers and producers interested in engaging with pressing social issues in entertaining and provocative ways. And his original work had an unusual revival in the 21st century, which saw a modernized version of Lear’s “One Day at a Time” and multiple broadcast TV specials in which actors performed old Lear scripts live, treating them like canonical theater pieces.

Here are six of the best shows Lear was involved with:

‘All in the Family’ (1971-79)

For much of the 1960s, television producers tried to compete with the movies by making their shows more visually dynamic — more “cinematic,” in other words. But with “All in the Family,” Lear and his frequent writing-producing partner Bud Yorkin took TV back to its roots in live theater, staging what were essentially weekly one-act plays about the Queens-based Bunker family: the grouchy bigot Archie (Carroll O’Connor), his doting but dim wife Edith (Jean Stapleton), his feminist daughter Gloria (Sally Struthers) and his feisty liberal son-in-law Mike (Rob Reiner).
