The allure of an ambassador’s life is obvious: wielding government power and throwing parties for influential people in a far-flung location. “The Diplomat,” which premiered last month on Netflix, highlights the glamour while omitting the drudgery of the job — the memos, press engagements and red tape.

In the show, Keri Russell plays a U.S. ambassador to Britain named Kate Wyler, who spends her days managing international crises with quippy retorts. She lives in a mansion, is photographed for Vogue and is married to a former ambassador, played by Rufus Sewell.

“The Diplomat” was Netflix’s most popular show in recent weeks, and U.S. ambassadors around the world are watching. It transforms diplomatic doublespeak into a smooth script, but does it accurately reflect the job? New York Times bureau chiefs and correspondents around the world asked ambassadors how well the show represented their work.

“We’re not as tough as the military, nor as cunningly cool as intelligence operatives,” John Feeley, a former U.S. ambassador to Panama, told my colleague Damien Cave. “So to have Keri Russell and Rufus Sewell have sex and call it a diplomatic rapprochement? Well, heck. I’ll take it. But it’s a fantasy.”
