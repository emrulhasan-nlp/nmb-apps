On June 24, 1983, Byllye Avery welcomed busloads of Black women to the campus of Spelman College in Atlanta. She was in a state of disbelief. The women had traveled from Mississippi, New York, Pennsylvania — even as far away as California — for a three-day event billed as the First National Conference on Black Women’s Health Issues.

She had hoped that 200 women would attend; nearly 2,000 showed up.

The event inspired a remarkable change in attitudes. There were panels and workshops on high blood pressure, diabetes, lupus, childbirth and mental health. But more than addressing specific illnesses, the conference encouraged Black women to share information and consider how oppression affected their interactions with the health system. Crucially, it reframed health as inextricable from racism.

In the most popular workshop, led by Lillie P. Allen, a public health activist, women shared their stories in a space so crowded that the attendees began to remove conference room doors from their hinges and camp out in a concourse to participate. Ms. Allen took off her high-heeled shoes and stood on a platform to address the crowd.

Ms. Avery decided to organize the conference when she was researching a paper on Black women’s health. What scant information she could find told a deeply troubling story. Black women had disproportionately high rates of disease across a swath of ills — hypertension, diabetes, cervical cancer, to name a few.
