In July, Shinjiro Atae, a 34-year-old Japanese pop star, made an unexpected declaration onstage in front of 2,000 fans: He came out as gay. In Japan, a conservative country that has not legalized same-sex unions, his announcement stunned the crowd.

But not Motoko Rich, a reporter in the Tokyo bureau of The New York Times, who was seated in the audience. The day before, Ms. Rich had visited Mr. Atae at his sister’s apartment in Tokyo. The two sat on the floor and, for an hour and a half, discussed how he came to terms with his sexuality. Mr. Atae told her that it was his recent move to the United States that persuaded him to come out publicly.

“He was very open,” Ms. Rich said in a recent interview. “He talked about living in Los Angeles and learning that there was another way to be in the world.”

In recent months, Ms. Rich has covered other pivotal moments for Japan’s L.G.B.T.Q. community, including the passing of a contentious bill aimed at tackling “unfair discrimination.” Here, she explains the significance of Mr. Atae’s public declaration and why the new bill, in some ways, still falls short of real change. This interview has been edited.
