anna martin

From “The New York Times,” I’m Anna Martin. This is “Modern Love.” And today, we have a little treat for you. I’m here with my colleague Astead Herndon. Hey, Astead.

astead herndon

Hey, Anna. Thank you for having me.

anna martin

So, Astead, you’re a political reporter here at “The Times.” And you’re the host of “The Run-Up,” which is our weekly politics show. And you’re here because you recently went to a speed dating event. Not for yourself; for reporting purposes. I want to be very clear about that. And, Astead, you went to this event to find out how are single people bringing politics into their search for love, and do their political beliefs influence who they decide to date? I cannot wait to talk to you today. But I got to ask first, as a political reporter, did you ever think you’d be on “Modern Love“?

astead herndon

No, [LAUGHING]: I am a listener, a fan, but —

anna martin

You don’t consider yourself a modern lover?

astead herndon

No, I wouldn’t say that. I’m more of a —

anna martin

Old-school.

astead herndon

Old-school, yeah. I was going to say, what’s the opposite of modern and love? Old school and — [LAUGHING]

anna martin

Old-school hater.

astead herndon

Yeah, old-school hater, exactly. That’s more my vibe. [LAUGHING]

anna martin

Well, welcome. We welcome that vibe on the show. So your beat is politics. Mine is love. But you just made an episode recently that combined the two. So can you tell me about what you wanted to investigate and how your team went about it?

astead herndon

Yeah, I mean, so much of our show is focused on themes of division and political polarization. One of the things we wanted to do was see how politics is playing out in people’s day-to-day lives and their individual choices that they’re making. And we thought that there is nothing more intimate and personal than your choices of dating and love and romance. And so we decided that we would actually go to a speed dating event out in Pennsylvania in a suburb right outside of Philadelphia, and talk to people who were there to find love about how they view these issues of politics and dating, and how it plays out in their own individual romantic choices.

anna martin

Why outside Philly? What was the choice there?

astead herndon

I mean, the TLDR is it’s just the closest swing state. And we can also say that this is a place where they’re going to be bombarded with political ads.

anna martin

Yeah, so give me a sense of how all this worked. What was it like walking in there?

astead herndon

We got there early. We made sure we introduced ourselves to people before the event officially started. So by the time they were actually ringing the bell and sitting down, mostly everybody knew that there were these two reporters here and what we were trying to do.

anna martin

There was a physical bell that they rang?

astead herndon

Yeah, so I think you had six or seven minutes for each person. The women stayed seated. And the men rotated. And they would ring the bell, a physical bell, when it was time to move.

anna martin

Like a musical chairs of men.

astead herndon

Yes.

anna martin

I like it. OK, so now we’re actually going to hear this reporting you and your producer Elisa did, the people you talked to, and your observations about what it all meant. Let’s hear it.

astead herndon

Yeah, let’s hear it. [MUSIC PLAYING]

astead herndon Shall we go in? elisa gutierrez Yeah, let’s go in. Yeah, we have a half an hour.

astead herndon

When we walked in, we were greeted by a big bunch of pink and red heart balloons. And a bucket of roses for $5 apiece was sitting on the counter.

elisa gutierrez We’re here for work. So stay on mission, Astead. Don’t get distracted. [LAUGHING]

astead herndon

We set up shop at the hotel bar, talking to people throughout the night. And here’s what we wanted to know. If you had just a few minutes to win someone’s affection, how political would you get? And is there anything at all to be learned about national politics or the mood of the country from dating?

ashley I’m Ashley. radhia I’m Radhia. ashley And I’m out here because of her. [LAUGHING] astead herndon Oh, well, she brought you? ashley We’re cousins. astead herndon You’re cousins. ashley Yes. radhia No, just trying a different way to meet people. I mean, we’ve been trying on dating websites, and it hasn’t been working. So we thought, let’s give this a try to see maybe we’ll have better luck. ashley The struggle is real. astead herndon Do you care about politics or issues or things like that? Do they come up? Does it matter? ashley You know what? I will say, if it’s like super extreme. You know what I mean? And you can’t respect, as an adult, someone else’s opinion. You know what I mean? But if you’re hardcore one way, I can’t — astead herndon You’re saying it doesn’t matter that someone agrees with you. It just really matters if they disagree with you. ashley I think, and this might — I mean, whatever. I think it’s hardcore disagree for me. astead herndon That’s what you don’t want to see. That’s the deal-breaker. ashley Exactly, yes. astead herndon More than agreeing with everything. ashley We can disagree. But if you’re riding hard like this is one of your family members, I can’t. astead herndon Is that about an individual candidate? Are we talking Donald Trump? Is it about individual issues like abortion or guns? Is there some things that matter at the top of that list? ashley Things that I’ve run into on the apps, I don’t know about this, but usually someone will ride for a candidate. Right now it’s Donald Trump. And anything he says is gold. And it’s like, come on. You know what I mean? Nothing anyone says is gold. astead herndon Would it matter on the opposite side. If someone thought everything Joe Biden said was gold, would that be a problem? ashley I mean, I lean more towards his social values more than the other side, but I can take from both. You know what I mean? But to ride hard right or left — astead herndon That would be a red flag for you, or would it be a deal-breaker? ashley It’s a beige flag. astead herndon Beige flag, OK. [BELL RINGING] samoya So my name is Samoya. And what brought me here is just I need to find love. I just want someone compatible. astead herndon Does politics matter any? samoya I do not want it to come up. They always say, your first date, don’t introduce your ex. Don’t talk about your ex. Don’t talk about anything of that harsh — yeah, we don’t want that right now. astead herndon All good. All good vibes. samoya Very chill, just to see how the person flows with you. I think that’s what I want to do. astead herndon When does it come up then? samoya It’s going to probably flow out maybe on the second date and the second and a half. I was actually dating somebody initially. He told me that he supported Trump. And I just completely just told him it won’t work. But then I felt like, you know what? Maybe I need to — because I am new in this country, maybe I need to educate myself a little bit more. So I feel like I should have stayed around a little bit just to hear his perspective and to do my history, do my research. astead herndon Do you regret cutting it off? samoya I feel like I’m sorry I did because there’s always room for learning. And you should never really cut somebody off. [BELL RINGING] john All right, I’m John. I’m 41. Single for the last five years. Owning a business. And this was a great opportunity to get out. astead herndon One question we have is specifically about division and politics. Are there things you try to not talk about? john Yeah, politics. astead herndon Politics? john Yeah, yeah, yeah, there’s no real point in talking about politics. We’re all just people. Our thoughts aren’t going to change anything, unfortunately. So unless the government was actually going to listen to the people, there’s no sense in talking about it. If somebody wants you to pick a side, that’s too much — too demanding. astead herndon You don’t want to pick a side? john I don’t want to pick a side, no. I just want to be myself. astead herndon If someone was a strong Democrat or a strong Republican, both of those would be things that you stay away from? john Yeah, I think most people are somewhere in the middle of a little bit of both. And everybody’s allowed to have their own opinions. That’s what makes us such a great country. Somebody that’s going to stop you or try to change your opinion, it’s just an opinion. I’m not doing what the other side’s telling me to do. Just let me be me. [BELL RINGING] astead herndon Time to go in. Thank you so much.

astead herndon

It was funny. Our team spends so much time in political settings, at rallies, and campaign events, places where people define themselves through common political beliefs. But here, it was entirely different. Politics wasn’t just in poor taste or a subject to be avoided. It was a complete turnoff.

karen OK, so my name is Karen. I came here with a couple of girlfriends. They were like, oh, let’s do this. It’s something different. It beats being online. astead herndon Are there values or things that you would put at the top of your priority list when you think about a partner or a match? karen I definitely have ones that, just from past experiences and from my past relationships, I know generosity is something that I value. I don’t want someone who’s trying to mooch off of me. But I also don’t want someone who’s trying to take from the world. I want someone who’s giving back and who will help others give back. And to be honest, I really don’t like to pay for things.

[laughing]

So I do want them to be generous with me, too.

astead herndon Are there beliefs? Are there things like that? Do you ask about that? karen So I’m very anti-political. I’m not political at all. I’m a big believer in everyone’s entitled to their own beliefs. I’m a big believer that they shouldn’t be pressing that on someone else. So I don’t care if you’re the two different sides. I just don’t want you to try to push that on me. And I don’t want you to try to diminish me for what I believe in or don’t believe in. I don’t watch the news. The only thing I watch is Bravo. Obviously, that’s the only news that people should be informed on. It’s just that’s the stance that I’ve taken, just seeing what the political world has done to the society that’s meant to be united. [BELL RINGING] astead herndon What’s your strategy when you go into these type of things? What are you looking for? speaker 1 Well, depending on how I feel, I guess first impressions, you want to have a good first impression. But at the same time, you don’t want to put yourself out there as a generic candidate of like, oh, I’m indifferent to things. So maybe not being overtly direct about your political ideologies, at least at the very beginning. Let’s say you don’t want to come off as someone that’s only like — in a way that’s like, oh, you’re solely a political activist for one side or the other. I don’t know how to — I don’t know if that’s the best way to put it. I mean, I just kind of go with the flow. So if it comes up, it comes up. But I wouldn’t bring it up apropos of nothing, because that just makes it seem like you’re an extremist, like this is all you want to talk about. astead herndon Does it come up, historically, as you have been out there? Or is it easy to avoid? speaker 1 I think it’s probably easy to avoid. I don’t think most people are as extreme as we get an idea of on social media and stuff because you just get the loudest voices on social media. I think a lot of people are a little hesitant to bring stuff up if they think it’s going to be a little risque. astead herndon I guess it seems easy to avoid. It seems like you’re having to have — at least for that initial first one, make sure you’re sticking on a more general basis. speaker 1 Yeah, I mean, I’m not here to make statements about my political views or anything like that. I’m just here to meet someone. astead herndon Yep. [BELL RINGING] What brought you out here today? speaker 2 My friend here. My friend here invited me. speaker3 Just an experience. Just a friend experience tonight. astead herndon Yeah, do you ask about more serious or heavier topics? Do you expect to be asked about it? speaker 2 Absolutely not. I don’t expect to be asked about it because my questions don’t really give off don’t ask me if I’m a liberal. I feel like it’s very natural conversations. It’s very awkward to — a lot of people are getting out of their shell. This is their first time. I don’t think to ask about their political values or anything like that. astead herndon So there are things that they look for that would be deal-breakers for them politically. Do you have those type of things? speaker 2 I mean, yes and no, within reason. How crazy are you? How radical are you, I should say? Because if you’re radical, then I’m like, oh, well, no, no, no, no. I don’t think about politics every day. So it really just depends. Rather doesn’t rule my life. I do other things. astead herndon The bad sign would be if it takes up a lot of your life. That would be scary. speaker 2 Yeah, I think there’s a healthy ground here when you talk about things that — because I don’t think — if you live and breathe politics, then it must be your job. And if it’s not your job, then you’re crazy passionate about something that doesn’t go within your day to day. And if I’m a part of your day to day, that’s great that you fit that in there. It doesn’t really correlate with my life. But if that’s your values, that’s fine. They’re not for me if they’re really, really intense about it. But I don’t — astead herndon Is that how you feel is, like, that — speaker 3 Yeah, I’m kind of the same way where it’s like, obviously, if there’s something that we completely disagree on, that’s a big flag. astead herndon What about specific issues when we think about gun rights or abortion rights or anything like that? Is there issues that matter just as much? Or is it just — is it like — speaker 3 There are definitely specific issues like women’s rights, obviously. astead herndon Yeah, I was going to say, can you tell me what a deal-breaker is? speaker 3 Just like dating as a minority, if someone comes off a little racist, I’m going to say no.

[laughing]

I think equality matters just in all instances. So, yeah, as long as someone’s aligned on that affiliation, then —

astead herndon As long as they’re aligned on those big things, then you will figure out the smaller things. speaker 3 Yeah. astead herndon Well, thank you. I really appreciate y’all’s time. speaker 3 Oh, yeah. [MUSIC PLAYING]

astead herndon

Almost every single person we talked to said a version of the same thing. When it comes to politics and dating, they weren’t concerned about finding a partner with an identical viewpoint, but avoiding people that came off as too rigid in their thinking be it right or left. In fact, the only automatic deal-breaker, at least to this crowd, was someone being too into politics. [BELL RINGING]

speaker 4 Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention, please? We’re going to take a five-minute break. We’ll reconvene after five minutes. OK, five-minute break.

anna martin

Hey, it’s Anna again. And we’re going to take a little break, too. Then I’ll be back with Astead to debrief his experience at the mixer. [MUSIC PLAYING] OK, so, Astead, coming out of that mixer, I have to ask you, would you ever try to meet someone that way? Or is it just the apps from now on?

astead herndon

I mean, I actually — I feel like speed dating generally really won me over. I found it really wholesome and kind of endearing to try to meet someone in real life, to put yourself out there. I definitely am someone who believes that dating via apps has become gamified and a little gambly. And I definitely think that the apps are a self-selecting group of people who are most willing to judge for a political opinion. And so there was a way that the speed dating really made me feel like, oh, this is a type of person that is more focused on building a relationship. Everyone there was serious about it.

anna martin

I love that. I mean, unlike the apps with their filters and whatever, this mixer was a room full of strangers trying to make a genuine connection with other strangers. Yeah, it’s really sweet. OK, so at that mixer, you met people looking for love who didn’t want to bring up politics too soon, and also didn’t want to date someone who was too obsessed with politics. But some people did acknowledge that differences in politics or values would come up if they made it past the first date, right?

astead herndon

Absolutely, we talked to one guy specifically who was telling us that his Christian faith is really important to him personally. And so he was really weighing when and how to reveal that, because he worries about the type of assumptions that people make in regards to someone being religious.

anna martin

Yeah, let’s hear from that guy.

speaker 5 I think what ends up happening, a lot of people start making it very political. And then I just do not want to go down that. astead herndon What do you mean? speaker 5 Like typically, if you’re a Christian, then it’s like, oh, you’re a Republican, or you’re conservative in very specific areas like the abortion or the gun rights and everything like that. And then that’s where it’s just like — I don’t want these preconceived notions. I don’t want that to be how we’re communicating to each other. And I want it to be a little bit more relaxed, and want them to feel comfortable that way. elisa gutierrez I mean, specifically, what are the preconceptions people have that you think — would say you don’t agree with? [BELL RINGING] speaker 5 I’m pro-life no matter what. astead herndon That’s the conception people have? speaker 5 Yeah, because I’m a Christian, yeah. astead herndon Can I ask, are you? speaker 5 I’m more pro-choice, to be honest. astead herndon Do you say that on dates? Does that come up? speaker 5 I don’t mention that ever on a date, yeah.

[laughing]

That’s not something —

astead herndon You got to go. Thank you so much for talking to us.

anna martin

So this guy’s faith is so important to him. But he’s conflicted about when to bring it up on a date because of the political baggage attached to it. You touched on this a bit, but it strikes me that people like him are just very different from who we normally hear from on your show “The Run-Up.” When you’re talking to people at rallies and campaign events, those people are showing up with their political identities front and center, right?

astead herndon

More often, yeah. I mean, a lot of the type of events that we go to that are on the campaign trail are full of people whose political identity is their own, and who really gravitate to people who share and reflect that. But that’s not who decides elections. The majority of people who vote, who live in this country sound a lot like those daters. They don’t have politics in the forefront of their minds. They’re not thinking about this stuff day to day. And for some people, they don’t think politics is a core determining factor of who someone is. And so I think it’s important for us to make sure we’re finding people who are doing that same level of wrestling like the guy that we’re hearing, because that’s the type of way that most people interact with this in their lives. People want to be seen outside of just one defining factor.

anna martin

I mean, when I hear that guy, I think it’s super relatable to be like, I want someone to get to know all of me, not just one piece.

astead herndon

Yeah, and, I mean, I said this to him, my father’s a pastor. And I’ve been on a date when I’ve been like, oh, this is what my parents do. Or it’s a big part of stories of how you grew up. But when you reveal those things, I can feel the assumptions happening. Almost always it’s like, well, what do you believe? Are you religious now? I totally understood where he was coming from because I have had that experience before. When I think about the scene at speed dating, I think about some of the reporting that our colleague has done, Jessica Grose who writes about dating and relationships on the opinion section. And she has this phrase that thirst conquers all. And I think that —

anna martin

Thirst conquers all.

astead herndon

Yeah, thirst conquers all. And I feel like that was really on my mind. For a lot of people, the desire for companionship and connection is such where they could put some of those rules to the side if someone has other qualities that they think might matter more. So respect and connection and support and all of those things can come ahead of whether we agree on this big thing right or whether we vote for the same person. I think dating is one of those areas that exposes that, for a lot of people, those rules are a lot more squishy.

anna martin

Totally, I was going to say we might assume that politics is all red versus blue. But people are so much more complicated than that when it comes to their personal lives, to their dating lives, the people they want to fall in love with.

astead herndon

Our political system does not recognize nuance and difference. It forces people into binary choices and into corners that are not reflective of their own beliefs, right? One thing I like about thinking about love and dating and the work that you all do, is that there is more nuance in individual people than there is in who you vote for.

anna martin

Totally, I said this at the beginning of our conversation that your beat is politics, and my beat is love. But hearing your reporting on the complexities of the dating world, I’m starting to think that maybe our beats are not as far apart as I assumed.

astead herndon

No, I don’t think they are.

anna martin

Astead, thank you. I had so much fun today. Thank you for coming on the show.

astead herndon

Thank you. I did, too. I appreciate you having me. [MUSIC PLAYING]
