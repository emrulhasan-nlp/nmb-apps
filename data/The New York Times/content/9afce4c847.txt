New Yorkers will soon be able to get a year’s worth of hormonal birth control from pharmacies without a prescription.

The New York State Department of Health issued an order on Tuesday formally authorizing the measure, which was passed last year by the State Legislature and signed by Gov. Kathy Hochul.

Under the law, pharmacists can dispense three different types of hormonal birth control to both New York residents and out-of-state visitors: birth control pills, vaginal rings and contraceptive patches. They will also offer counseling and information about the medication as well as the risks of H.I.V. and other sexually transmitted diseases.

Officials say the aim is to remove barriers to contraception access and safeguard reproductive freedoms while other states restrict them.

“This is about access to care, it’s about the individual autonomy, it’s about health equity,” said James McDonald, the state health commissioner. “But it’s also about protecting reproductive rights, which are all very core to the mission of the New York State Department of Health.”
