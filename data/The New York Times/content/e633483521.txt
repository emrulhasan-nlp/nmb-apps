China’s economic problems can seem sudden and surprising. Just a few years ago, its economy inspired worldwide envy. Today, signs of trouble appear to be everywhere.

The real estate market is in a serious slump. Consumer spending is weak. Unemployment among young adults has surged above 20 percent — and the government has responded by suspending the release of that statistic.

“The most terrifying thing is that everyone around me is at a loss of what to do next,” Richard Li, the owner of an auto parts business who has closed two of his four stores, told my colleague Li Yuan. “I used to believe that our country would become better and better.”

Today’s newsletter is intended to help you make sense of the turnabout. My main argument is that China’s problems are not, in fact, new. They have been building for years, and Chinese leaders have long vowed to address them. So far, though, they have mostly failed to do so. That failure is catching up to them.
