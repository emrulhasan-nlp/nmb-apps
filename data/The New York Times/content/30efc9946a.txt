Re “Trump and Allies Seeking Vast Increase of His Power” (front page, July 17):

Donald Trump plans, if elected next year, to revamp the administrative state, also known to conservatives as the deep state, also known to Mr. Trump as the warmongers, the globalists, the “communists, Marxists and fascists,” “the political class that hates our country.”

Once revamped, this new state would be much more under Mr. Trump’s control, without those pesky independent agencies that are beyond his reach.

We had a state like that in the past, headed by King George III, and decided that we did not like it, which is why we have what are quaintly known as “checks and balances,” designed precisely to prevent the president from amassing too much power.

Are we really ready to replace “Hail to the Chief” with “Hail to the King”?
