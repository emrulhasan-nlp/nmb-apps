Californians could soon be paid far more for jury duty.

A bill moving through the State Legislature would give certain jurors $100 a day for serving on a criminal trial jury, a big jump from the current daily rate of $15. If the legislation passes, jurors will be eligible for the higher stipends in Los Angeles, Alameda, Kern, Monterey and San Francisco Counties through 2025.

The proposal was inspired by a pilot program in San Francisco that has increased the racial and economic diversity of the county’s jury pools by providing $100 daily payments to low- and moderate-income jurors. In California, employers are required to give workers days off to complete jury duty, but they don’t have to pay employees’ wages.

In San Francisco, more than a third of residents say that serving on a jury poses an economic burden, according to city officials. So many lower-income jurors were being excused for financial hardship that juries were becoming increasingly wealthy and white, because of the correlation between income inequality and race, said Assemblyman Phil Ting, who sponsored the new legislation. That further slanted the criminal justice system against people of color, he said.

During one criminal trial observed by San Francisco’s public defender’s office, people of color made up roughly 50 percent of the initial pool of jurors. After jurors were excused for financial hardship, the composition of the jury pool became 39 percent people of color and 61 percent white people.
