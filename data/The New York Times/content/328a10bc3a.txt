To advance his relentless political ambition, Donald Trump has ridden a promise, a commitment and a pledge.

A promise to end the illegal flow of migrants, drugs, cash and guns “across our border.”

A commitment to stop other countries seeking “to suck more blood out of the United States.”

A pledge to impose law-and-order solutions on cities “where there is a true breakdown in the rule of law,” describing a majority-Black city like Baltimore as “a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess” and warning gangs of shoplifters just last week that if he is elected again, “we will immediately stop all of the pillaging and theft. If you rob a store, you can fully expect to be shot as you are leaving that store.”

How relevant will those themes be heading into the 2024 election? Will they work to attract enough voters for him to win? Do they address the sources of voter anxiety?
