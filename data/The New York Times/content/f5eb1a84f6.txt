Sarah Wunsch, a civil liberties lawyer who championed citizen protections on issues of race, gender and free speech and helped persuade New Yorkâ€™s highest court to declare that men could be prosecuted for raping their wives, died on Aug. 17 at her home in Brookline, Mass. She was 75.

The cause was complications of a stroke she sustained three years ago, her spouse, Christine Ernst, said.

As deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts for almost three decades, Ms. Wunsch brought innovative challenges before the courts, aimed at safeguarding a wide range of public behavior, including panhandling for small amounts of change, tattooing, wearing certain hairstyles in school and videotaping on-duty police activity.

She even ghostwrote a letter to the state legislature on behalf of her bull terrier, opposing a bill that would have forced owners to muzzle and chain some dog breeds while in public.
