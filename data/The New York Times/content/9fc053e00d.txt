For a spell this summer, it appeared as if Nashville was headed toward another season of polarization.

In May, the superstar Jason Aldean released “Try That in a Small Town,” a middling single from his 11th studio album that likely would have fizzled were it not for an incendiary music video, which arrived two months later, filled with scenes of urban unrest and culture-war dog whistles. It became a talking-head flashpoint, a symbol of what’s widely presumed to be a not-so-latent conservatism in country music.

Then, into that white-hot climate landed “Rich Men North of Richmond,” a bracing, out-of-nowhere statement of anti-government, anti-elites skepticism by a previously unknown musician who performs as Oliver Anthony Music. Starting as a frills-free YouTube clip filmed by a local public-radio station, it became perhaps the year’s biggest viral sensation, going straight to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. Through the lens of “Try That in a Small Town,” “Rich Men North of Richmond” seemed to many to be conservative manna, with its allusions to Jeffrey Epstein conspiracies and commentary on the welfare state.

But things were not quite as they seemed — it was a conflagration, but one quickly extinguished. Recently, the men of country music — and as per usual, they are mostly men — have been singing songs about sin and redemption, personal struggle, the fragility of emotional bonds. The music is inward-looking in sentiment, and only sometimes nods to broader political and social concerns. It suggests a genre that, fitfully at least, may be inching away from the sectarian and toward the ecumenical.
