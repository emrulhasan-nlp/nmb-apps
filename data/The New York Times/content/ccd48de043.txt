Updated with articles and multimedia linking Dr. King’s work to the Black Lives Matter protests that many believe may be the largest movement in United States history.

Martin Luther King Jr. Day, an annual federal holiday since 1986, celebrates the national civil rights leader who was instrumental in challenging the racial caste system that delineated how millions of Americans lived their lives.

All 50 states celebrate the public holiday on the third Monday in January, but not all states, cities and towns dedicate it solely to the Rev.
