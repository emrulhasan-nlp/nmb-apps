The final day of California’s legislative session is here.

That means we’ve reached the last, harried hours for lawmakers to pass any remaining bills for 2023, on tackling the state’s housing crisis, labor battles, fentanyl problem or anything else.

Each year, lawmakers tend to delay decisions on the highest-profile and most contentious bills until the very end of the legislative session, which makes the final few days particularly hectic. After today, legislators aren’t scheduled to reconvene until January. (Though California has two-year legislative sessions and the current one runs through next November, Capitol insiders refer to the annual deadline for floor votes as the “end of session.”)

A major compromise has already been reached this week between labor groups and fast-food companies, paving the way for workers to be paid a minimum wage of $20 an hour. An attempt to bail out home insurance companies has apparently failed for now. Lawmakers approved a bill limiting who could carry guns in public, setting up a fight that some believe could end up at the U.S. Supreme Court.

I reported on Wednesday from the State Capitol in Sacramento, where the Senate and Assembly held lengthy floor sessions to make their way through hundreds of bills. A piece of legislation needs approval from both chambers — and must have any amendments approved by the originating house — in order to reach Gov. Gavin Newsom, who can either sign or veto it. (The Legislature can override a governor’s veto, but rarely does so.)
