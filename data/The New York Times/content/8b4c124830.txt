The above graph was previously published in The New York Times. The data is from an online survey of 1,495 young adults ages 18 to 34. Young adults who responded that they are not in contact with their living parents were screened out of the survey.

1. After looking closely at the graph above (or at this full-size image), answer these four questions:

What do you notice?

What do you wonder?

How does this relate to you and your community?

Create a catchy headline that captures the graph’s main idea.

The questions are intended to build on one another, so try to answer them in order.

2. Next, join the conversation online by clicking on the comment button and posting in the box. (Teachers of students younger than 13 are welcome to post their students’ responses.)

3. Below the response box, there is an option to click on “Email me when my comment is published.” This sends the link to your response which you can share with your teacher.

4. After you have posted, read what others have said, then respond to someone else by posting a comment. Use the “Reply” button to address that student directly.
