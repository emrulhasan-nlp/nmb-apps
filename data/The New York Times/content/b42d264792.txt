For months, Beth Levine, an attorney in New York, grew worried about developments in Israel, where the far-right government has sought to diminish the judicial branch’s independence. Its efforts provoked massive protests in Israel and smaller ones in the United States, including most Sundays in Manhattan’s Washington Square Park. Though sympathetic to the cause, Ms. Levine, who lives in the Bronx, never attended.

Then two things happened:Israel’s government passed the first of its judicial changes in July, a move supportive ministers said would eliminate an obstacle to the popular will. And Israeli expatriates in New York, loosely organized under a grassroots group called UnXeptable, planned a rally this summer across the street from Israel’s consulate in Midtown to coincide with the Jewish holiday of Tisha B’Av, which commemorates the destruction of the ancient temples in Jerusalem and other tragedies. The timing resonated with Ms. Levine, and, for the first time, she came.

“It seemed to me very significant,” she said. “Many of the worst things that happened on that holiday happened because of ‘sinat chinam,’ or baseless hate, among Jews.”

This month promises a flurry of activity. Organizers staged rallies in dozens of cities globally Sunday, two days before Israel’s Supreme Court considers an appeal of the first overhaul law, including one in front of the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington. Protesters in New York plan to greet Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, on Sept. 21 when he is scheduled to speak at the United Nations General Assembly. And a “democracy prayer” co-authored by a prominent American rabbi will be read at synagogues across the country for Rosh Hashana, the Jewish new year festival, which begins Friday evening.
