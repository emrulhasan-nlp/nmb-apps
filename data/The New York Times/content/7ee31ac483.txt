Ernesto Londoño I’m a reporter for The New York Times based in Minnesota, covering news in the Midwest and keeping a close eye on drug use and counternarcotics policy.

What I Cover

I have a broad range of interests and appreciate how often my job allows me to learn about interesting people and places. Spending a year working on a forthcoming book about medicinal psychedelics made me deeply interested in the intersection of mental health and drug use. Other subjects I’m drawn to include crime and punishment, gender identity, immigration and mindfulness.

My Background

I was born and raised in Bogotá, Colombia, and moved to the United States for college in 1999. My journalism career began in 2003 at The Dallas Morning News, where I covered local news. In 2005, I moved to The Washington Post, where my assignments included covering the Pentagon, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the Arab Spring. I joined The Times in 2014 as an editorial writer and later served as the newspaper’s correspondent in Brazil for a little over four years. In 2023, after working on my book project, I became part of a team of reporters covering the Midwest.

In addition to English, I speak Spanish and Portuguese. I have a daily meditation practice that has shaped my approach to journalism, perhaps most significantly by making me a better listener.

Journalistic Ethics

I take pride in helping to uphold The Times’s standards of integrity and professionalism outlined in our Ethical Journalism Handbook.
