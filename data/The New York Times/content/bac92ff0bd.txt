What’s the best way to choose the right college? And is there one “right” college for anyone? Most published rankings are one-size-fits-all, based on formulas that don’t factor in your priorities, goals and needs.

So we’ve created a tool to help find the best American colleges — for you. Do you care most about making money after graduating? Low college costs? Diversity? Academics or athletics? Staying close to home? Use our tool’s sliders and filters to tell us what you value, and we’ll give you college rankings that fit.
