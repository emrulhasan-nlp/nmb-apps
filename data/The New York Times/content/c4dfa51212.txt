JOHN LEWIS: In Search of the Beloved Community, by Raymond Arsenault

MEDGAR AND MYRLIE: Medgar Evers and the Love Story That Awakened America, by Joy-Ann Reid

In the spring of 1961, John Lewis and Medgar Evers found themselves at odds with the leadership of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The N.A.A.C.P. executive secretary, Roy Wilkins, wanted Black freedom won through institutional channels: voter registration and the courts. As 21-year-old Lewis and the other young Freedom Riders prepared to set off by Greyhound for Mississippi that May, Wilkins fretted: What would their new allies in the White House think? He dismissed the journey as a “joy ride.”

It was anything but. As a pair of new biographies show, Lewis and Evers helped to develop the direct-action protest tactics that reshaped the civil rights movement. In the deeply researched and accessible “John Lewis,” for example, the historian Raymond Arsenault describes how the Freedom Riders were arrested and jailed almost as soon as they reached Jackson. (They tried to use the whites-only restroom at the bus station.) Their incarceration garnered national attention, and, by the end of the summer, more than 400 activists were inspired to participate in more than 60 different rides. Two-thirds of them ended up in prison in Mississippi.
