The indictment of Donald Trump on Tuesday on four counts stemming from his attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election has reanimated a question legal scholars have long debated: Are Trump’s false claims that the election was stolen from him protected by the First Amendment?

In May 2022, the Brennan Center at N.Y.U. held a round table discussion on just this question (“Is the ‘Big Lie’ Protected Speech?”).

“We are in a five-alarm fire for democracy, and this is something that started in 2016,” one of the panelists, Katy Glenn Bass, the research director of Columbia University’s Knight First Amendment Institute, said. “It is the result of decades of campaigns to undermine faith in the media, and all sorts of declining trust in public institutions.”

“Lies spread by presidents and other high-ranking government officials,” she added, “are so damaging to democracy that America must find constitutional ways to hold them accountable, more than we hold other liars to account.”
