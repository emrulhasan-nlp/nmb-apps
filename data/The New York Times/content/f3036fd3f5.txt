Sitting in his empty cab on Thursday as another taxi driver pushed it from behind, Miguel Ángel Dorantes surveyed the scene of devastation left by the most powerful hurricane to hit the Pacific coast of Mexico, wondering if he would be able to reach home. Mudslides blocked off his hillside house in Acapulco. Basic goods were scarce because of aggressive looting following the storm.

“We have no gas, no water, no food,” he said, as people ran past his car and other gridlocked vehicles, carrying bottles of water, bags of beans and anything else from nearby stores. “Everything has been looted. There’s nothing to take anymore.”

The extent of the destruction left by Hurricane Otis, which turned a once popular tourist destination into a scene of chaos, only started to come into view that morning. More than two dozen people were killed and three were missing after the storm made landfall in the early hours of Wednesday with an intensity that shocked forecasters and government officials.

Thousands of military officers, medical teams and government officials confronted a devastated Guerrero State on Thursday. Communication and power systems remained largely off in much of the state, making the scope of the hurricane’s toll difficult to ascertain.
