Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida has conducted a long-running campaign to limit the autonomy of Disney World, one of his state’s largest employers.

His efforts have widely been seen as retaliation for Disney’s opposition to legislation that Mr. DeSantis signed last year that prohibits classroom instruction and discussion about sexual orientation and gender identity in some elementary school grades.

Here is some background on the yearlong dispute.

What have Mr. DeSantis and Disney been fighting over?

In March of last year, the governor signed into law the Parental Rights in Education Act, often referred to by critics as the “Don’t Say Gay” bill.

The legislation prohibited classroom instruction and discussion about sexual orientation and gender identity in certain elementary school grades.
