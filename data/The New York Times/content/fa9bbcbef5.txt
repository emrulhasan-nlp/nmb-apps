When Representative Mike Johnson of Louisiana wanted to make the case against abortion rights last year during a Capitol Hill committee hearing, he grilled a witness in graphic fashion.

“Do you support the right of a woman who is just seconds away from birthing a healthy child to have an abortion?” he asked at a Judiciary Committee hearing.

When the witness, Dr. Yashica Robinson, a board member for Physicians for Reproductive Health, responded that such a situation had never occurred, Mr. Johnson only doubled down.

“Never happened in your practice, ma’am,” Mr. Johnson fired back. “But it happens. How about if a child is halfway out of the birth canal? Is an abortion permissible then?”
