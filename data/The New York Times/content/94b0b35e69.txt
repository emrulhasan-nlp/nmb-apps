At Eton College — the boarding school in the British countryside that has educated princes and 20 prime ministers — students wear tailcoats and white ties to classes. But some have worn waistcoats with the symbol of Black History Month underneath.

The students still sleep in ivy-covered stone dormitory buildings, some dating to the 18th century. Some of them have rainbow pride flags fluttering from them.

It’s an all boys school, but there also is a feminism society and a celebration of International Women’s Day.

“They’re on the right track,” said Alasdair Campbell, a 19-year-old recent graduate.

“Horrible,” said Felix Kirkby, 21, another of its alumni. “It’s destroying its reputation.”
