It was an enticing new option for pandemic-era child care, and almost infuriatingly simple: What if stay-at-home parents watched the children of parents who had to work?

Helen Mayer, an entrepreneur based in Boston at the time, came up with the idea after she had to shut down her college-focused company at the start of the pandemic, joining the millions of women who were pushed out of the work force. Overnight, she became a stay-at-home parent to her toddler twin boys.

As she searched for jobs, Ms. Mayer, 26, became more and more frustrated by the lack of affordable, quality child care options. At one point, she had to turn down a job offer because the company did not include any child care benefits. As she witnessed versions of her story play out across the country, she started to get “really mad,” she said. “It shattered the anchors that I had as a woman, going through college and believing that I would have a level playing field if I ever decided to start a family.”

Harnessing her outrage, Ms. Mayer became a kind of matchmaker: By the end of 2020, she had helped 400 families find child care by linking them up with nearby stay-at-home parents who could provide it. She called the service Otter (her mother’s favorite animal), and it soon attracted the kind of investor attention that has been rare for a start-up focused on child care and rarer still for start-ups led by female founders.
