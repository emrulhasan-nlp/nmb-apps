The global climate summit’s declaration on fossil fuels got all the headlines this month in Dubai. But nature scored quite a win of its own.

In the final agreement, attendees of COP28 recognized that climate change threatens ecosystems and the billions of people who depend on them. They also committed to halting all deforestation and forest degradation by 2030, as well as the destruction of other land and marine ecosystems.

In a first, negotiators also aligned the climate declaration with a separate agreement to protect biodiversity that includes goals such as safeguarding 30 percent of the world’s land and seas.

“The ministers chose today to break from traditional silos and to pursue strategies that put nature at the heart of climate change responses,” Joe Walston, the executive vice president of Wildlife Conservation Society, said in a statement.
