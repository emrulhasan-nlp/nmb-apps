From “The New York Times,” I’m Sabrina Tavernise. And this is “The Daily.” [THEME MUSIC] In the two years since the US pulled out of Afghanistan, what was feared has now come to pass. The Taliban has shut women and girls out of public life. My colleague Christina Goldbaum traveled across Afghanistan to talk to women about how they’re managing these changes. What she found is not what she expected. Today she brings us the stories of three women. It’s Monday, June 5. So, Christina, the last time we talked about Afghanistan on the show was last summer. And, at the time, the Taliban had banned young women from high school. You went to Afghanistan earlier this year on a reporting trip. Catch us up on what’s been going on.

christina goldbaum

Sure. So remember, after the Taliban seized power in August 2021, there were a lot of questions around just how far the Taliban would go in their treatment of women and girls. And in that time, we saw the government begin to roll back some rights. But what we’ve seen in more recent months is the Taliban administration introducing more and more restrictive policies that, in a lot of ways, have just erased women and girls from public life.

archived recording 1 Well, Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers have imposed yet another restriction on women.

christina goldbaum

Last November, they banned women completely from public places like parks and gyms.

archived recording 2 The Ministry of Virtue and Vice says the ban is being introduced because people were ignoring gender segregation rules and women were not wearing the hijab.

christina goldbaum

And then in December — [CHATTER]

christina goldbaum

— they expanded their education restrictions and banned women from attending universities.

archived recording 4 Effectively banning women and girls from middle school through college. [CHANTING]

christina goldbaum

And then, soon after that, they introduced another ban —

archived recording 5 You have some big aid groups now stopping operations in Afghanistan.

christina goldbaum

— that prevented women from working in international NGOs —

archived recording 6 Any such group that continues to employ women will lose its license, according to the Economic Ministry.

christina goldbaum

— and then, a couple of months later, barred them also from working at all UN agencies in Afghanistan. What we’re really seeing now is how the Taliban’s treatment of women is setting the country on course for complete isolation on the world stage. These policies have been pretty much universally condemned, including by other Islamic governments like Saudi Arabia and Iran. And a few months ago, the UN also released a report saying that the regime’s policies towards women were tantamount to gender apartheid.

sabrina tavernise

So this has just been a relentless crackdown, and it’s now gotten even worse. Women have lost pretty much every freedom in Afghan society, and everyone can see it. So what did you go there to do? What were you curious about?

christina goldbaum

Yeah. So the latest restrictions really felt like a turning point for women’s rights under the Taliban. It often feels, nowadays, like almost every door has been closed to women in the country. But I knew that, in response to these policies, the women whose reactions we tend to hear the most — the ones that are most amplified — tend to be women who are in Kabul, educated English speakers. But that’s really only a small subset of the women who are in the country. So on this trip I wanted to speak to other women, from other parts of the country, to get a more nuanced picture. So a few colleagues and I traveled across Afghanistan to speak to women of all walks of life, and try to understand how they were experiencing all of the changes over the last several months.

sabrina tavernise

So where did your journey start?

[non-english chatter]

christina goldbaum

So the first stop in our journey was in Wardak province.

christina goldbaum It’s around 12 o’clock. We’ve just spent the last hour or so driving through these kind of winding roads in Central Afghanistan.

christina goldbaum

It’s a province that’s just West of Kabul, and it’s a very rural area.

christina goldbaum Everything around here — the mud brick homes, the earth — they’re all this kind of ashen gray color. And the village is kind of nestled in the foothills of these mountains and overlooks this valley of —

christina goldbaum

The area we went to is called the Tangi Valley. And it’s a pretty conservative place that has had pretty strong ties to this government.

christina goldbaum The valley actually became known for the pretty large number of US troops that were killed here.

christina goldbaum

The province is home mostly to Pashtuns. So that’s the main ethnic group of the Taliban. And so given how intensely this area had experienced the violence during the war —

christina goldbaum So we’re walking down this very narrow, kind of icy pathway.

christina goldbaum

— I wanted to understand what this new era was like for women there.

christina goldbaum And we’re going to the home of a woman and we’re going to go talk to her about how she —

christina goldbaum

So I got into this village. [KNOCK ON DOOR]

speaker [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] ayesha [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

And I met with a woman named Ayesha.

ayesha [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] christina goldbaum Thank you so much for having us to your home. I really appreciate it.

christina goldbaum

And she lives in the small brick home that’s on the foothills of the mountain overlooking the valley. She has this really kind of wrinkled face, and is sort of short, and kind of shuffles about to get around the house.

ayesha [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] translator [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] ayesha [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

She told me that she was around 65 or 70 years old.

ayesha [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

She doesn’t know her exact age because they didn’t keep any kind of formal records. And we sat down on this dusty wool carpet on the floor, with a few other elders from the village and a couple of her grandchildren who are kind of running in and out of the room. And she started to tell me about her life.

christina goldbaum And where did she grow up? Where was she born? translator [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] ayesha [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

She said that she grew up in rural Wardak and she grew up pretty poor.

ayesha [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

And I asked her if she ever went to school, and she said that she didn’t.

ayesha [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

There wasn’t even a girls primary school where she grew up. There was a school for boys, but girls weren’t allowed to go.

ayesha No. No. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

And then, when she was around 16 years old, her father told her that she had to marry a man in a neighboring village. And shortly after she got married, her first husband died. And then she got remarried to somebody else in the Tangi Valley and they started a family. And she had three sons and four daughters. They had a small plot of land where they grew beans and wheat. And they never had very much, but they had at least enough to get by.

translator [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] ayesha [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

And then the war started.

ayesha [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

And she told me about how she remembers American tanks rolling through the village. And at that point, initially, she felt kind of hopeful that maybe the US was there to help improve conditions in this community. And then, pretty quickly, she realized that that wouldn’t be the case.

ayesha [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

As the years progressed, there was a lot of homegrown support in this area for the Taliban. And in her village, a lot of young men joined the movement. A lot of families provided support. And that meant that the fighting there became pretty intense.

ayesha [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

The way that she put it was that when they would leave the house, death was their companion. It happened that frequently, that people were killed. And it got so bad that, at one point, they even moved to a different village trying to get away from the fighting. But it wasn’t long until the devastation reached her home, too.

ayesha [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

She told me about one night, about a decade ago, when she and her family went to a wedding in a village nearby. And after the celebration, her second oldest son, Shireen, stayed in the house where the wedding took place. He was going to spend the night there with a few people he knew, including some Taliban fighters. And while we can’t know for sure, she insisted to me that her son was not a member of the Taliban.

ayesha [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

And that night the house was hit in what she said was an airstrike, and her son was killed.

sabrina tavernise

Oh, man. How old was her son?

christina goldbaum

22 years old.

ayesha [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

And she said that, from that moment forward, she decided that she wasn’t going to help or cooperate with either side of this war. She would not help the Taliban. She would not help the Americans. She said that she hated all soldiers. She hated this war. But it just kept taking from her.

ayesha [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] translator [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] christina goldbaum Can she come and, yeah, and show us exactly what — what happened?

christina goldbaum

After she told me that story, she led me just outside the front door of her house —

ayesha [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

— to explain the second tragedy that happened to her and her family. It was a few years later, after her son Shireen was killed.

translator [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] ayesha [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

And she was walking back from another wedding with her oldest son, Farouk, and his kids and his wife. And she said, at this point, she was so used to the war that she used to carry a flashlight and point it at herself, so that anyone who was watching would know that she was a woman. She wasn’t a combatant. She wasn’t a soldier.

sabrina tavernise

Wow.

christina goldbaum

And this night it was late. It was around 9:30, and she heard this gunshot. And then she heard her son let out a sound. And she turned around, and she pointed her flashlight at him. And she saw him kind of stumble a few steps back and fall to the ground.

christina goldbaum Where was the check post? speaker On the top of the hill you can see it. christina goldbaum On the top of that hill? speaker [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] christina goldbaum Yeah.

christina goldbaum

She said he had been shot by American-backed Afghan forces. So she ran up to him.

ayesha [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

And she still remembers kind of leaning over him —

christina goldbaum When he was on the ground there, she grabbed onto his hand. She put his hand on her leg?

christina goldbaum

— and taking his hand in her lap, and having it there as he died.

ayesha [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] christina goldbaum So after that she always said, don’t walk beyond this path?

sabrina tavernise

Gosh, her second son.

christina goldbaum

Yeah.

ayesha [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] speaker [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] christina goldbaum So when she comes out her front door, she sees the tomb of her youngest son. And when she goes out the back door, she sees the tomb of her oldest son. Both of them. Oh, my dear, I’m so sorry. ayesha [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

So you can imagine that when the Taliban seized power and took over Kabul, there were celebrations in her village.

ayesha [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] speaker [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] ayesha [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

She remembers crying from happiness that this war was finally over. And she said that now she feels this sense of peace and of security. She can travel and see relatives that she hadn’t seen for years. She can leave her house comfortably.

ayesha [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

And nowadays she was saying that when she goes to the market or when she goes to the river to wash her clothes, she’s not anxious about am I going to make it home alive. And how now that the war is over, she has this kind of newfound freedom.

sabrina tavernise

So normal life has come back, which is a huge relief. But what about all the changes the Taliban’s made since they took over? What did she say about that?

christina goldbaum

Well, she did acknowledge that, in a lot of ways, her life has gotten more difficult now.

ayesha [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

With the economic collapse after the Taliban seized power, her family is really only scraping to get by. There isn’t much work for her one surviving son. Sometimes they don’t have any food to eat for dinner besides bread and tea. And when I asked her what she thought about the government’s restrictions specifically on women, she said that she disagrees with them.

ayesha [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

She thinks that women should get an education. She thinks that even if a woman’s main role in Afghanistan is leading her family, that she will do that better if she’s educated. And at one point she kind of pointed to her granddaughter, who was sitting right beside her with her head in her lap. And she said that she’s afraid that her granddaughter will grow up and, just like her, be uneducated, be illiterate. She won’t have a brighter future. But for her, after what she experienced over the 20 years of war — the loss that she experienced, the violence that her family experienced — for her, the idea of an education for girls is seen as kind of a luxury. It’s something that, to her, is less important than just staying alive and surviving.

sabrina tavernise

So Ayesha is basically saying here that she’s willing to tolerate these really extreme policies against women and girls if ultimately it means being safe, which is just a really practical human response to the violence of war.

christina goldbaum

It is.

ayesha [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

And she even told me that she would be happy dying from hunger that night as long as it meant that the war did not return. Those are the standards by which she’s judging this government and the policies that it’s implementing. But women in another province we went to nearby felt very differently.

sabrina tavernise

We’ll be right back. So, Christina, tell me about the next province you went to. What happened there?

christina goldbaum So it’s around 10:30 AM, and we’re in Bamiyan.

christina goldbaum

So a few weeks later I went to Bamiyan. It’s the province just west of Wardak, and this area is home mostly to Hazaras. It’s an ethnic minority in Afghanistan. They’re Shia, not Sunni like the Taliban. And the group has historically faced a lot of persecution in the country.

sabrina tavernise

So very different from Ayesha and her community in Wardak.

christina goldbaum

Exactly.

christina goldbaum When the Taliban first came to power in the ‘90s, a lot of people here were killed at that time.

christina goldbaum

And then, after the Taliban’s first government was toppled, Hazaras across Afghanistan benefited a lot from the US intervention. They went to universities, got degrees. It was like a 180. Things kind of completely changed. And so when the Taliban seized power again, there was a lot of fear about what this chapter in Afghanistan’s history would mean for them.

christina goldbaum We’re here to meet a woman who’s continuing to teach girls who are in high school. So I’ve got a face mask on. We’re trying to go a little bit low profile.

christina goldbaum

And one reason I wanted to go there in particular is because we had been talking to this teacher turned activist who was running a secret school for girls in Bamiyan.

sabrina tavernise

A secret school?

christina goldbaum

Yes. An underground school.

christina goldbaum We’re in now this kind of neighborhood that’s kind of tucked away into the mountainside. We’re just trying to figure out where exactly it is.

christina goldbaum

And, eventually, we got to this house that looked like any other. And we walked in.

hamida [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

And inside it, there were these three rooms that had been transformed into three small classrooms.

hamida [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

And we went into one, and there were a few dozen girls who were high school age. And they were sitting on these rickety wooden benches in a physics class with this whiteboard in front of them. Most of them had winter coats on, because it was still pretty cold and the room wasn’t heated.

hamida [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

And they were all sitting there with these kind of old torn notebooks and pencils in hand.

sabrina tavernise

So this may look like an ordinary classroom. But, actually, it’s a very feisty act of resistance.

christina goldbaum

It is. I mean, this is a hugely risky undertaking that these students and these teachers have at this school.

hamida [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

But I was looking at this teacher in the front of the room, and she was as confident as ever. You would think that nothing they were doing was illegal. And after the class let out, we sat down with her to talk about the school and her students.

sabrina tavernise

So tell me about her.

christina goldbaum Here we start with Hamida. How old are you, Hamida? speaker [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] hamida [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] speaker 25.

christina goldbaum

So her name is Hamida. She is 25 years old. She had this dark auburn hair that was falling out from behind her headscarf.

hamida [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

And she was explaining to me that she used to teach at a private school in Bamiyan, and she really loved it.

hamida [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

But then there was one moment, about six months after the Taliban seized power, when things suddenly changed for her.

hamida [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

She said that there were some local Talib officials who had asked a handful of women to put out the word that there would be this large gathering, like a workshop, about supporting women and children.

hamida [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

And she said like it felt like every woman from the city came to this meeting.

hamida [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

But when they got there, they started to think that they were actually being duped.

hamida [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

There were these posters on the back of the wall that were kind of pro-Taliban. And they thought it looked like local Talib officials wanted to use the gathering kind of like a photo op, to take a picture and say, look at all these women who gathered here to support this new government.

sabrina tavernise

Hmm. So not, in fact, a workshop to help women at all, but just something for their own PR.

christina goldbaum

Exactly.

hamida [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

And the minute that Hamida realized that, she became furious. And she went to the back of the room, and she ripped down one of those posters.

hamida [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

And then she caved this fiery speech about how she didn’t think the Taliban represented them. And she wouldn’t be here to stand for this.

sabrina tavernise

Wow. That’s pretty brave.

christina goldbaum

Yeah. And there was a video of that kind of made the rounds on social media. [CHEERING] I mean, you can just imagine how bold a move that is. This is a government that has arrested and detained protesters and dissidents. It’s a huge risk. And so basically, from that point forward, she felt like she had this target on her back.

hamida [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

She said that a few local Talib officials showed up at the school where she was working. And so she had to quit because she was worried about her security there. She pretty much went into hiding. She stopped living in her family’s house and started living with a friend. She never really left the house.

hamida [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

And she described this moment as being this kind of dark period. Because it just went against every instinct she had in her body to not be speaking out or doing something, and just be staying at home.

hamida [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

And so when she started to see what was happening with all of these restrictions a couple of months later, she basically said, enough is enough. She gathered a few other teachers she knew in the fall of last year, and they decided to start this underground school for girls.

sabrina tavernise

So how does she go about doing that? What does she do?

christina goldbaum

So one of these teachers offered up her house and said they could use that for the classrooms. And they took some chairs and benches that the teacher once used at a private school she worked at, and brought them into the house. And they pooled money together to buy whiteboards and pens.

hamida [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

And then they went for about a week, street to street, door to door in their neighborhood, telling families that they were going to open the school, and trying to convince them that they should send their girls.

sabrina tavernise

And what would the families say? I mean, what was the response?

christina goldbaum

I mean, a lot of parents were understandably afraid. But on the other hand, they were also really eager to have their daughters go back to school. Because they had been sitting at home pretty isolated, and bored, and depressed for months. And a lot of them also just really wanted their daughters to retain all the progress they had made in school up until that point.

hamida [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

And the first day they had about 50 students show up.

hamida [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

And then, by the end of their first week, that number had shot up to 150 girls who were all there sitting in classes.

sabrina tavernise

Wow.

hamida [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

Every family contributes whatever they can. The community offers up donations for supplies. And Hamida also said that she and other teachers prepared as best they could to keep this thing underground. They have students come at slightly different times, to stagger their entrance and stagger their exits.

sabrina tavernise

Wow.

christina goldbaum

Only people in the neighborhood really know about the school. And they’ll keep an eye out, too, for anyone who they think is maybe a Taliban intelligence officer. It’s really this whole community effort to keep this going, and keep girls in the neighborhood going to school.

hamida [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

sabrina tavernise

So is Bamiyan and the secret school an outlier? Is this very unusual for Afghanistan?

christina goldbaum

So it’s really not. There are probably now hundreds of these kind of underground schools for girls all across the country.

sabrina tavernise

Hundreds? Wow.

christina goldbaum

And not long ago, we visited a school in Kandahar — the Southern heartland of the Taliban. And there was an underground school there that worked in pretty similar ways. So really across the country, since high schools have closed, people have accepted that this is the new reality, that they don’t feel like there is really any chance that this government under this leadership will reopen high schools. They found these ways of continuing to get educated and continuing to kind of cultivate these seeds of hope for girls’ futures.

sabrina tavernise

But, Christina, at the end of the day for these girls, isn’t it a dead end? OK, they can go to school in the secret school. But there won’t be a college for them to go to. And there won’t be a job for them to go to.

christina goldbaum

That’s true. And Hamida, these girls, they all recognize that. But I think also what motivates her is knowing that in order for there to be any hope that women win back their rights in Afghanistan, first they need to be educated. Hamida and these girls want to prepare for whatever comes next. Because they hope they might be able to use this education and bring the country forward.

sabrina tavernise

Right. So, Christina, you went to Wardak where you met Ayesha, who feels freer since the Taliban returned. And then you went to Bamiyan and met Hamida, who feels the opposite. Where did you go next?

christina goldbaum

So one of the most consequential restrictions that the Taliban introduced was the ban on women working for aid groups and the UN. Because so many people in the country rely on those groups to survive. And I wanted to understand how that ban was affecting women who relied on aid every day.

christina goldbaum So it’s around 5:00 PM. We’re on the outskirts of Herat, this big city in Northwestern Afghanistan.

christina goldbaum

So we went to Herat, which is a city in the Northwest part of the country. It’s along the border with Iran. It’s known for the kind of poetry and art that comes out of it. But Herat’s also surrounded by some of the country’s poorest provinces.

christina goldbaum There’s Farah to the south, which is pretty much just desert. There’s Ghor to the east, which has historically been one of the poorest areas of Afghanistan. And Bagjhis to the north, which has been hit by drought for the last couple of years.

christina goldbaum

And so over the past couple of decades, Hera’s become this kind of hub for people who are displaced from their homes and were looking for aid. Because a lot of the big aid groups have bases in that city.

christina goldbaum And we’re in this settlement that’s on just the outskirts of the city, where a lot of those families have come in recent years. And we’re here to —

christina goldbaum

And we went to one of those camps where there are about 600 families living.

christina goldbaum And we’re here to meet with this woman, Jamila, who’s 27. She’s a widow, and she’s helped organize a lot of the aid that’s come in here.

christina goldbaum

And that’s where I met this woman named Jamila.

christina goldbaum So, Jamila, can you tell me a little bit about yourself? jamila [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

She moved to the camp around five years ago after her husband died. And it was a really rough time. Because her husband, who was a day laborer, was the breadwinner for her and her children.

jamila [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

And she thought, OK, maybe if I move to Herat to one of these camps, that she’d be closer to some of the aid organizations that would be able to help her family. And, to an extent, that plan kind of worked.

jamila [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

She said that they got food aid from groups like the World Food Program. And over time she kind of became a fixer of sorts for aid groups working in the camp.

jamila [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

So if they were going to do a food distribution on a particular day, they would call her up and she would get the word out to people that they needed to be at this particular place at this particular time. If other women in the camp need anything they would go to her. And then she had the number for people to call to say, hey, we need some more flour. Hey, we need some more oil. We need medical help. And ultimately, over the last five years, that aid is what helped her family survive.

jamila [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

And for a while she was even hopeful that if things continued in that way, that she’d be able to send her kids to school. And she had this kind of hope. But then the Taliban seized power. About a year later they banned women from working in these aid organizations. And it suddenly became a lot harder for women to access aid.

sabrina tavernise

And why was that?

christina goldbaum

So there are two parts to that. For one, even before the Taliban came to power, in many parts of the country women — especially in rural areas — typically don’t interact with men outside their families. And so by banning women from working for aid groups, it effectively cut women off from being able to directly access aid distribution. And the second thing is that, in response to the initial ban, some of the major aid organizations also suspended their operations entirely while they tried to figure out what to do.

sabrina tavernise

OK. So it’s not just the Taliban banning women from these aid groups. It’s the aid groups themselves — their response to what the Taliban did — that’s also making women’s lives more difficult. In other words, doubly bad for someone like Jamila.

christina goldbaum

Exactly.

jamila [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

Practically what it’s meant for Jamila is that, on the one hand, some organizations aren’t working anymore. So this lifeline she had — people she could call and get help — suddenly they’re telling her, sorry, our operations have been suspended. We can’t come deliver you a food parcel.

jamila [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

And on the other hand, the aid organizations that are still working, many of them are only using men for, say, food distribution. And because Jamila is a widow, she doesn’t have a husband she could send in her place.

sabrina tavernise

Right.

christina goldbaum

So what this means pretty much is that she’s kind of lost access to the steady stream of food that she once had.

sabrina tavernise

So this just sounds like a pretty dire situation for her. How is her family surviving at this point?

jamila [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

So for now she’s surviving on the little money she’s making from creating these handicrafts with the wool, and harvesting saffron during the saffron season. People in the camp give her what they can to try to help. But it’s incredibly difficult.

jamila [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

And she really worries now about her childrens’ future. Because she doesn’t have food for them on a day to day basis, and then she also knows that she probably won’t be able to send them to school. Because they’re going to have to start earning money as young as they can in order to help the family survive.

jamila [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

And she’s especially worried that, if things continue like this for a long time, she’ll have to marry off her very young daughter in a couple of years or promise her for marriage in order to get the dowry money from the groom’s family.

sabrina tavernise

So selling off her own daughter to buy food.

christina goldbaum

Yeah. I mean, it’s a devastating prospect. It’s one that a lot of women across Afghanistan now are faced with.

jamila [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

And she told me that right now she just feels totally hopeless. She said when she was younger she used to have this hope that one day she would live a better life. And now —

jamila [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

— she told me that she’ll take the dream of a better life with her to her grave. That is how she feels about the current situation.

sabrina tavernise

Yeah. She is single-mindedly focused on basic survival. And what her story does really show is that the world hasn’t figured out how to help women in this gender apartheid state.

christina goldbaum

Exactly. I mean, what Jamila is living through now just really epitomizes that dilemma. Right? How does the world interact with and respond to the Taliban? And when I asked her about what she thought of all of this —

jamila [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

— she said she felt like women were suffering from both sides of this equation. On the one hand, the Taliban’s policies have been so restrictive towards women that they don’t have any opportunities to go to school, or get jobs, and pay for food for their own families.

christina goldbaum So that’s what she would say to the Taliban. What would she say to the NGOs who are saying, well, just leave. jamila [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

christina goldbaum

And on the other side of it, she said that if she could talk to the heads of these international organizations she would say, look at how my family is suffering.

jamila [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

And to be fair, these organizations are in a kind of impossible situation. I mean, they’re faced with this choice between either delivering life saving aid that may not reach women at all if they’re only using men to deliver it, or upholding these principles of gender equality that are at the core of a lot of their missions. It’s an incredibly tough spot to be in. But in the meantime, as the rest of the world tries to figure out what to do, ordinary Afghans in the country are suffering.

So stepping back here, Christina, you traveled all over Afghanistan, far from Kabul, heard all of these perspectives from women in different places in the country. Fundamentally, what did you take away from your trip and from all those conversations?

So I knew going into this that it had become pretty clear that the Taliban government, under the leadership with its current Amir, is determined to roll back the clock on women’s rights. His vision for women in the country is much like it was in the ‘90s. That hasn’t changed. Another thing that hasn’t changed is that the international community, especially the West, is really struggling to create any kind of coherent policies towards Afghanistan. But one thing I was surprised by was just how much women had changed in such different parts of the country over the last 20 years. And you can really hear that in the stories of these women. Jamila only has an elementary school education. And yet she was sitting and talking to me so in-depth against the Taliban’s recent policies. Hamida is from Bamiyan, a place that has a terrifying, devastating history with the Taliban. And yet she is defying the Taliban’s edicts, day in and day out, at great risk to herself. And Ayesha is a grandmother from a Taliban stronghold who never got an education herself. And yet, even though she prefers life under the Taliban, she is still advocating for her granddaughter to go to high school. I mean, all of that is pretty incredible. And it shows how, while it might be easy for this government to enact these restrictive policies, it’s going to take a lot longer and be a lot harder for them to weed out these values that have taken root across the country over the last 20 years.

And Hamida, in particular, spoke to me really powerfully about that. But she also offered a kind of warning.

She said that right now women have this window where they can maintain some of the gains they’ve made in the last 20 years. But she worries about what happens in 5 or 10 or 15 years down the line if things continue the way that they are now. The way that she put it, it really sounds like the situation is like a race against time.

sabrina tavernise

A race against time because right now many women and girls remember what it was like during the generation that women did have freedoms. And that did change things.

christina goldbaum

Exactly. She said if young girls today, unlike their moms and their older sisters — if they don’t see girls going to school, if they don’t see women with any kind of power in society, then that’s it. All of those gains will be lost.

Christina, thank you.

Thanks so much for having me.

President Biden signed the Fiscal Responsibility Act into law on Saturday, ending the threat of economic calamity from a debt default just two days before the government was set to run out of cash to pay its bills.

In remarks to the nation from the Oval Office on Friday night, Biden praised the bipartisanship that led to the deal.
