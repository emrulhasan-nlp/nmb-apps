Ask a Brooklynite to define New York’s most populous borough, and you’ll get 2.7 million answers — or more. At the renovated and rebranded Center for Brooklyn History, they’re going with an ellipsis.

“Brooklyn Is …,” a new exhibition, marks the opening of the center, which welcomed visitors on Thursday after a three-year renovation and rethinking of the grand Romanesque revival landmark at 128 Pierrepont Street in Brooklyn Heights, formerly known as the Brooklyn Historical Society.

In addition to the new name, there’s now free admission, a more welcoming front entrance, lots of comfortable sofas and an emphasis on drawing a bigger, broader audience, who might not have thought their own stories can be found inside.
