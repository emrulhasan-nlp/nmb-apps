Joseph Lelyveld, a former executive editor and foreign correspondent for The New York Times, who won the 1986 Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction for his book “Move Your Shadow: South Africa, Black and White,” died on Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 86.

The cause was complications of Parkinson’s disease, said Janny Scott, his partner of 19 years and a former Times reporter.

Cerebral and introspective, Mr. Lelyveld was for nearly four decades one of the most respected journalists in America, a globe-trotting adventurer who reported from Washington, Congo, India, Hong Kong, Johannesburg and London, winning acclaim for his prolific and perceptive articles.

Coming home, he rose up The Times’s editorial pyramid to its pinnacle, the executive editorship, arguably the most powerful post in American journalism. In his seven years at the helm, from 1994 to 2001, The Times climbed to record levels of revenue and profits, expanded its national and international readerships, introduced color photographs to the front page, created new sections, and ushered in the digital age with a Times website and round-the-clock news operations.
