What’s the anatomy of a fall movie season? Although the writers’ and actors’ strikes have kept Hollywood in suspense, the calendar is, for now, still filled with exciting titles, including work from established masters (Martin Scorsese, Sofia Coppola, David Fincher) and relative breakouts like Justine Triet, the director of, well, “Anatomy of a Fall,” which won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival in May. Here is a select list of features coming to theaters and streaming services beginning later this month. (Pedro Almodóvar and Wes Anderson, among other directors, are releasing shorts but those are not included.) Release dates and platforms are subject to change.
