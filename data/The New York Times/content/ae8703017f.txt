Before leaving his house each day, Castillo Javier Police always made sure he carried the essentials. Hat. Wallet. Birth certificate. But the last item still did not stop him from being detained — and then deported.

While picking up groceries one night this summer, he was stopped by Dominican immigration authorities. He pulled out the document showing that he was born in the Dominican Republic. Still, the officials bused him to a detention center.

Days later, Mr. Police, 21, was expelled to Haiti, a country he had never been to and is so mired in gang violence that the United Nations on Monday approved a Kenya-led security mission to the country to help quell the unrest.

“I don’t know anyone in Haiti,” Mr. Police said. “How am I going to go back to the Dominican Republic? How are my mother, father and brother feeling right now?”
