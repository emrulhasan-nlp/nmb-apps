History was made 20 years ago today at San Francisco City Hall.

Gavin Newsom, who had taken office as mayor of San Francisco the month before, directed the city clerk to begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, the first in California. He said he believed that denying gay and lesbian couples the right to marry was a form of discrimination.

More than 4,000 gay couples were married at San Francisco City Hall over the next month, in what supporters called the “Winter of Love.”
