On Aug. 16, 2011, my father woke up and couldn’t get out of bed. Until then, he was an avid outdoorsman, who cast for trout on the Delaware River and trained German wirehaired pointers to track and point pheasant. So after an ambulance ride to the emergency room and then hours of tests, the diagnosis shook our family: Stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer.

Scans revealed tumors all over his body — brain, ribs, pelvis, spine. The tumors on his vertebrae quietly grew until they had cut off nerve signals to his legs.

More people die of lung cancer in the United States every year than from prostate, colon and breast cancers combined. Our family received hope, however, when a biopsy revealed that my dad’s cancerous cells had a molecular marker on their surface making them an ideal candidate for erlotinib, a drug that could disrupt their growth. Just weeks after he received his first dose, my mother phoned with tears of joy in her voice to tell me that the tumors were shrinking.

Erlotinib is a textbook example of what physicians call “personalized medicine,” or sometimes “precision medicine.” In contrast to traditional, one-size-fits-all health care, personalized medicine uses molecular-genetic information about patients to deliver the right treatment, to the right patient, at the right time. Prominent medical geneticists, influential federal scientists, hospital system executives and even elected officials foresee cancer treatments as the leading edge of a genomic revolution, ushering in a new era of miracle cures and biomedical magic bullets, and fundamentally transforming the care of desperate patients.
