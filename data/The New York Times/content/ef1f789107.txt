WASHINGTON â€” In her final appearance as a lawyer before the Supreme Court, in 1978, Ruth Bader Ginsburg argued in favor of the equal treatment of women in the justice system. She made her case to nine men.

In the years since, there have been five female justices, including Justice Ginsburg, who served from 1993 until her death in 2020. The current court includes three women.

Women have made less headway on the other side of the bench. In the term that ended in June, just 18 percent of arguments were presented by women, according to data compiled by Kimberly Strawbridge Robinson of Bloomberg Law.

A year before, the figure was 13 percent. Over the past decade, Ms. Robinson found, the percentage of female lawyers presenting arguments at the court ranged from 12 to 22 percent.
