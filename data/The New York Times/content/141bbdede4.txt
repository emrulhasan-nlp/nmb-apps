Jenny Vrentas I am a New York Times reporter covering money, power and influence in sports.

What I Cover

I write about off-the-field topics that affect people, teams and sports leagues, in particular the N.F.L., including civil rights issues, gender-based violence and health and safety.

My Background

I joined The Times in 2022 as an enterprise and investigations writer in Sports. When the department was disbanded in September 2023, I moved to the Business Desk. Previously, I spent more than eight years as an N.F.L. writer for Sports Illustrated and six years as a sports reporter for The (Newark) Star-Ledger. I began my journalism career at The Daily Collegian, the student newspaper of Penn State University.

I grew up in State College, Pa., a daughter of chemical engineers, and received a bachelor’s degree in biochemistry and molecular biology from Penn State in 2006, before earning a master’s degree from Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism in 2007.

I serve as the local chair for the NewsGuild of New York and am an active member of the Times Guild, our newsroom union, which works to ensure that The Times is a fair and equitable place to work. My pronouns are she/her.

Journalistic Ethics

As a Times journalist, I adhere to the standards of integrity outlined in The Times’s Ethical Journalism Handbook. I want all of my work to be accurate and fair. I do not accept gifts, money or favors from anyone who might figure into my reporting. I protect my sources.
