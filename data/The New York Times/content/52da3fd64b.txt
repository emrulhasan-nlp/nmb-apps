From The New York Times, I’m Sabrina Tavernise, and this is The Daily. [THEME MUSIC] On Friday, the Supreme Court delivered another major decision on the last day of its term, ruling in favor of a web designer who argued that having to create websites for same-sex marriages violated her right to free speech. Today, my colleague Adam Liptak, on how the ruling puts freedom of expression above freedom from discrimination, and what that might mean for all kinds of different groups of Americans. It’s Monday, July 3. Adam, you’re back.

adam liptak

Hello, Sabrina.

sabrina tavernise

So this time, you’re here for another major case. One, potentially, with far reaching consequences for same-sex couples. Tell me about the ruling.

adam liptak

So this is the end of June, when we get the big cases. And this is one we’ve been waiting for many months. The question is whether a website designer with religious convictions can refuse to provide services to same-sex couples for same-sex marriages. And the court, by the usual 6 to 3 split, with the six Republican appointees in the majority, says, yes, she can. She has a First Amendment free speech right not to be compelled by the government to say things she doesn’t believe. She says that same sex-marriages are false and that, in having to comply with a Colorado anti-discrimination law that forbids discrimination on many grounds, including sexual orientation, the government is making her violate her free speech rights by compelling her to say something she doesn’t believe.

sabrina tavernise

In other words, she has the right not to make a website for same-sex couples who are getting married because they’re same-sex couples, something she disagrees with.

adam liptak

Right. And there is an established First Amendment doctrine called “compelled speech” that says you can’t force schoolchildren to say the Pledge of Allegiance, you can’t require people to, in New Hampshire, have a license plate that says “Live free or die.” And whether that concept fits neatly here is open to question. But the Supreme Court adopts that concept, or the majority does, and says that this anti-discrimination law, as applied to a web designer engaged in expressive conduct, violates the First Amendment.

sabrina tavernise

This is sounding vaguely familiar. I’m thinking about that case a while back about a cake baker who didn’t want to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding, also in Colorado.

adam liptak

It was about five miles away from where this web designer works.

sabrina tavernise

Wow.

adam liptak

You’re right to remember that case. It involved a baker named Jack Phillips, who made custom wedding cakes. He said they were artistic works, and he refused service to a same-sex couple, was punished for it. That case went all the way to the Supreme Court, but we didn’t get a definitive decision in that case.

sabrina tavernise

And remind me why, Adam, what happened?

adam liptak

I think the real reason was that the controlling vote was that of Justice Anthony Kennedy, since retired. Justice Kennedy was, on the one hand, the court’s greatest proponent of gay rights, the author of all four major constitutional pro-gay rights decisions. But also very sensitive to First Amendment free speech concerns. And I just don’t think he could make up his mind. So he ultimately found an off-ramp, ruling in favor of the baker on quite narrow technical idiosyncratic grounds. None of that is important to follow. The only larger point is that there was no decision. And we’ve been waiting now for years for the Supreme Court to return to this topic.

sabrina tavernise

OK. So now this case comes along, with this web designer. Tell me about her, the person at the heart of the case.

adam liptak

Her name is Lorie Smith. I paid her a visit some months ago, as the case was soon to be argued.

archived recording (adam liptak) So, Lorie, tell me about you, tell me about your business. What do you do here? archived recording (lorie smith) Sure. So you’re in my studio, this is 303 Creative, here in Littleton, Colorado.

adam liptak

And she told me her story.

archived recording (lorie smith) So I’m from a family of entrepreneurs. I always wanted to own my own business and I’ve always been creative.

adam liptak

She starts her own business, which makes ads, and logos, and websites.

archived recording (lorie smith) So, custom logos, custom artwork, custom designs.

adam liptak

For a variety of businesses.

archived recording (lorie smith) Nothing I create — No two things are the same. So everything’s custom expression and artwork in nature.

adam liptak

And she sees herself as an artist, and thinks that every piece of work she does for this business is unique.

archived recording (lorie smith) So my clients are coming to me because they’re not looking for a boilerplate template.

adam liptak

And she also says she’s eager to go into a new business. She wants to provide websites for weddings.

archived recording (lorie smith) When I started creating, I made a decision that the things that I create and designed for, they would be honoring and glorifying to God. And because of that, that means that I can’t create all messages.

adam liptak

But she says her Christian faith would not allow her to create websites for same-sex weddings.

archived recording (lorie smith) And I want to create weddings consistent with my faith, which teaches me that marriage is between one man and one woman.

adam liptak

She says she’ll serve gay couples in all kinds of settings.

archived recording (lorie smith) I love everyone, I serve everyone, I have clients who identify as LGBT, I just can’t promote every message.

adam liptak

Just not in connection with same-sex marriages.

archived recording (lorie smith) But the state says that I can’t do that.

adam liptak

And she’s afraid that if she goes into this business, but only serves opposite sex couples, she’ll be punished by the state of Colorado under its anti-discrimination laws.

archived recording (lorie smith) For me, I cautiously looked around the nature of the environment in Colorado and I saw what was happening with people like Jack Phillips, who has a similar faith to me, and I wondered if the state could do the same to me.

adam liptak

And she thinks that because she’s actually familiar with the cake baker case, she knows Jack Phillips, the baker in the case, and she knew she might run the risk of getting in trouble with Colorado, as he did, if she were to turn down business based on same-sex marriages.

archived recording (adam liptak) So how do you get involved in this lawsuit? archived recording (lorie smith) Well, it started about six years ago.

adam liptak

And so she gets together with a big Christian litigating firm called Alliance Defending Freedom, which had also represented Jack Phillips, and they file suit. And they do so before she’s actually opened her doors to this kind of business. They say that she has reason to be afraid that she’ll face punishment if she starts into this business but won’t serve same-sex couples for same-sex weddings.

archived recording (lorie smith) And so rather than wait to be punished, I decided to take a stand to protect my First Amendment rights. And I shouldn’t have to be punished before I challenge an unjust law.

sabrina tavernise

So there’s really not a real-life dispute here, right? She’s just trying to, kind of, head off the potential for a dispute that she thinks she might have if she expands her business.

adam liptak

Right. In the case with the cake baker, there was detailed record evidence in the court files on who had done what, when, and it really added some texture and context to the case. In this case, Smith said she had received, but never responded to, a request from what looked like a same-sex couple. Now, according to recent reports, the request was bogus, submitted under the name of a straight man. But in any event, the case is very different from that of the baker.

sabrina tavernise

Right. He actually had denied baking a cake to an actual couple, right? So, as you say, they were facts in the case. Here, she hasn’t denied service to anyone, it’s kind of something that might happen in the future.

adam liptak

Right. So we don’t know what the request would look like, we don’t know what any resulting website would look like. It’s an odd thing to have a Supreme Court decision, based on so little evidence.

sabrina tavernise

But obviously, nonetheless, the case makes it all the way up to the Supreme Court.

adam liptak

Right. And you have to think that Alliance Defending Freedom had wanted to find another plaintiff in another case to get back to the Supreme Court, particularly as its composition had changed, as it had become more conservative. And when the case arrives at the Supreme Court, it seems like a sequel to the case about the baker, and it is. But the baker’s case had two pieces to it. It had a religious component, whether the Colorado anti-discrimination law violated his right to free exercise of religion. And also whether it violated his right to free speech, to free expression.

sabrina tavernise

OK.

adam liptak

This time around, the court only grants the free speech question. So we’re looking at a case which has heavy overtones of a classic clash between religion and gay rights. But it takes the form of a question about free speech. [MUSIC PLAYING]

sabrina tavernise

OK, so instead of this being a fight about religion and free speech versus discrimination, it’s just free speech versus discrimination.

adam liptak

Right. The court apparently thought the best way to handle this question is in a streamlined fashion and really bear down on whether the First Amendment’s free expression protection applies, even in the face of an anti-discrimination law. [MUSIC PLAYING]

sabrina tavernise

We’ll be right back. [MUSIC PLAYING] OK. So how did we get to this ruling from the Supreme Court last week?

adam liptak

Well, after the court agrees to hear the case, they hear argument in December.

archived recording (kristin waggoner) Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court. Lorie Smith blends art with technology —

adam liptak

And it starts by Lorie Smith’s lawyer, Kristin Waggoner, getting up and making, basically, the same points that Smith made to me.

archived recording (kristin waggoner) Miss Smith believes opposite-sex marriage honors scripture, and same-sex marriage contradicts it.

adam liptak

That she has religious convictions, she shouldn’t be forced to violate them by saying things she doesn’t believe. That the First Amendment protects her in this area.

archived recording (kristin waggoner) I welcome this court’s questions.

sabrina tavernise

And what did the justices make of that argument?

adam liptak

Well, the justices were really trying to sort out what kinds of businesses are we talking about that can invoke the First Amendment at all.

archived recording How do you characterize website designers? Are they more like the restaurants, and the jewelers, and the tailors? Or are they more like the publishing houses and the other free speech analogs that —

adam liptak

Many people would agree that a painter, a songwriter, the ghostwriter of a biography, engages in First Amendment protected activity, and therefore might have a claim.

sabrina tavernise

But not, for example, a shoe store, or Walmart, or a tire company.

adam liptak

Right. If you’re just any regular business facing the public, you don’t have those rights, if what you’re selling isn’t your own expression. So the two ends of the spectrum are pretty well defined.

archived recording I thought that there really isn’t that clear a distinction in a situation like this.

adam liptak

That didn’t answer the question about whether this web designer, in this context, was engaging in expression.

archived recording Can I give you a hypothetical? It’s not really a hypothetical —

adam liptak

Justice Elena Kagan, for instance, says, what if what you’re offering is basically a template?

archived recording (elena kagan) You have lots of graphics, you have typefaces. And basically clients are coming in and they’re saying, we just want a standard website that tells people where to stay and how to travel there. And the question is, can a website designer say, sorry, that’s not my kind of marriage?

adam liptak

Does that amount to Lorie Smith’s expression? How much creativity does she need to bring to the project?

archived recording (elena kagan) So I think that, if I understand you, you’re saying, yes, she can refuse because there’s ideology just in the fact that it’s Mike and Harry, and there’s a picture of these two guys together. archived recording (kristin waggoner) That is speech, you are announcing a wedding. And if you believe —

adam liptak

There were questions about how much will people understand the resulting speech to be hers, as opposed to the couple’s.

archived recording (elena kagan) So, what’s the message if it says, save the date, Lily and Lillian, Lily and Mary? What’s the message there? archived recording (kristin waggoner) That’s an invitation to celebrate a marriage. archived recording (elena kagan) But why is it your invitation?

adam liptak

So I mean, if you look at a wedding website, are you going to go, well, that’s interesting what Lorie Smith thinks about same-sex marriage? Or are you going to think, here’s something that, perhaps in consultation with the artist, but nevertheless was created by and is the speech of the couple. Another major question is, how broadly would a ruling in favor of Lorie Smith sweep?

archived recording (elena kagan) Can I ask you a hypothetical that just sort of helps me to flesh that out?

adam liptak

Justice Kentanji Brown Jackson, for instance, asked an interesting hypothetical question.

archived recording (kentanji brown jackson) Can you give me your thoughts on a photography business in a shopping mall, during this holiday season, that offers a product called “Scenes with Santa?” And this business wants to express its own view of nostalgia about —

adam liptak

Let’s assume a shopping mall wants to have a kind of 1950s, sepia-toned Christmas setting in which they say Black children shouldn’t participate because that’s not their vision of what the 1950s in America was all about. Would that be acceptable? That’s a kind of speech, I guess, setting up a Christmas scene in a shopping mall. And are you allowed to discriminate that way?

sabrina tavernise

So she seems to be suggesting that a ruling in favor of Smith could actually go way beyond a web designers religious objections, that it could be a slippery slope.

adam liptak

Yeah, that’s right.

archived recording (kristin waggoner) But even if it were, this court has protected vile, awful, reprehensible, violent speech in the past. And it is never comfortable — archived recording (kentanji brown jackson) No, I’m just asking you, why is the objection —

adam liptak

An important point to recognize is that, let’s recall, we’re not talking about religious belief alone. We’re talking about any belief. And that belief can be quite ugly. It can be an anti-Muslim belief, it can be the idea that women shouldn’t participate in the work force. It could protect all kinds of discrimination, so long as we’re talking about expressive speech delivered on a custom basis.

sabrina tavernise

Got it.

adam liptak

Meanwhile, some of the conservative justices suggested there might be a slippery slope in the other direction as well.

archived recording The problem, and what a lot of the hypotheticals are getting at, is, however we decide this case, obviously, applies to others.

adam liptak

And in court, the justices were grappling with, well, where would the line be if this Colorado law was left in place? Couldn’t that leave the door open to at least some companies having to take on all kinds of work that they deeply disagree with?

archived recording Does every press release writer, freelance writer have to write a press release for the Church of Scientology, say, even though the beliefs of that institution may be inimical to the person?

adam liptak

And the more the justices talk, the more it becomes apparent that they’re finding these questions to be pretty hard.

archived recording So the answer is, yes, Colorado would compel that person. No. The answer is no. OK, why?

adam liptak

So there are, as lawyers like to say, a lot of line-drawing questions here. At the conclusion of the argument, though, I think I thought, and most observers thought, that the six justice conservative majority would find a way to rule for Lorie Smith, was basically sympathetic to her position. And that may have been inflicted by the particular context of the case that she was a Christian woman opposed to same-sex marriage. And this is a court that’s very receptive to claims based on religion, particularly from Christians, and maybe is not as sympathetic, in cases involving gay rights, as it might be in other cases involving other forms of discrimination.

sabrina tavernise

And of course, Adam, you were right during the oral arguments to assume what you did assume. That is exactly what they ruled. So tell me about the specifics of this decision.

adam liptak

Justice Neil Gorsuch writes for the six justice majority. And he basically says it’s true there are some hard questions here. There are some thorny questions. But the question in this particular case, he says, is an easy one, that Lorie Smith has a First Amendment right not to be compelled by the government to make websites for same-sex weddings, even in the face of a Colorado law that prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation.

sabrina tavernise

So basically, they duck the thorny issues and say she’s right. They kind of take her argument at face value.

adam liptak

Right. And I guess I’d say they take her facts at face value. Because they said that she was basically an artist, that she was engaged in expression, she had earnestly held views about same-sex marriage, and that she shouldn’t be forced to say something she didn’t believe.

sabrina tavernise

And in Gorsuch’s opinion, is there any limit to what a so-called expressive, creative business can do when it comes to denying services? If she, Lorie Smith, wanted to refuse services based on a different kind of belief, say, a belief that interracial marriage is wrong. Would denying a wedding website be protected in that case, according to his opinion?

adam liptak

So the decision is very closely tied to the facts of the particular case. But the logic of the decision certainly extends to other kinds of discrimination. I was particularly curious about what Justice Gorsuch would have to say about discrimination based on race. And I was surprised enough that I wasn’t finding that discussion that I did a word search in the document to make sure I wasn’t missing something. And, although the dissent discusses racial discrimination, there’s nothing about that in the majority opinion. So the opinion leaves open two kinds of questions. One of them, just how far some businesses can go in discriminating against people in various settings. But it also doesn’t answer the threshold question of what businesses qualify as expressive businesses in the first place. So Justice Gorsuch seems to studiously avoid drawing lines and distinctions, and is deciding the particular case without announcing general legal principles. And the Supreme Court usually is in the business of announcing general legal principles.

sabrina tavernise

So as this decision makes its way out into the world, the majority has not defined exactly what an expressive business is. It feels like that’s going to be the center of the debate going forward. I mean, this is incredibly squishy. And it seems like this opinion really does everything it can not to wade into that squishiness.

adam liptak

That’s right. And you can portray that in two ways. One, that it’s narrowly focused. But the other, in not addressing those other scenarios, it may open the door to all kinds of litigation and mischief. And Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s dissent sure makes the point that it’s hard to distinguish, based on the logic of the decision, other kinds of discrimination. For instance, and she has a lot of examples, but one she offers is, what if a business offers school photos? Can it deny those services to multiracial children because the owner does not want to create any speech indicating that interracial couples are acceptable? I don’t think Justice Gorsuch’s majority has an answer for that, or at least not one that he has offered.

sabrina tavernise

So she’s talking about the slippery slope and the negative possible effects from that.

adam liptak

Right. She’s saying that after the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s, we have gotten to a place in the United States where everyone has accepted that businesses open to the public can’t discriminate. And here, all of a sudden, we’re moving in the opposite direction on the basis of a First Amendment doctrine that has not previously been used to allow discrimination.

sabrina tavernise

She’s basically saying, this is discrimination, pure and simple.

adam liptak

Yeah. And I’m not sure Lorie Smith would say that she’s discriminating, she might not adopt that language. But in making distinctions based on her faith and declining to serve people, it is a form of discrimination. But maybe the First Amendment allows it.

sabrina tavernise

So, Adam, at the end of the day, this really limits the power of anti-discrimination laws. Right? How will they govern and be the law of the land in this new environment that we’re in after this ruling?

adam liptak

I agree with you, Sabrina, that it’s a significant step, but let’s also recognize the limits. It applies to a relatively narrow class of businesses. It applies to those businesses when they’re doing customized expression. And it only comes into play if the business, probably contrary to their economic interests, wants to discriminate against groups of people. And it’s true that most anti-discrimination laws will be enforceable tomorrow, just as they were yesterday. But at the same time, the message of the decision seems powerfully symbolic. In a clash between a woman’s religious faith and gay rights, religion comes out ahead. Or a cynic might say that this is a decision in the aftermath of the court’s ruling, establishing a constitutional right to same-sex marriage which has remained unpopular in some quarters, and is a signal in the culture wars, that same-sex marriages don’t get quite the same protections as other marriages. [MUSIC PLAYING]

sabrina tavernise

So even though the ruling was based on free speech, you’re saying it’s important symbolically, that this was specifically about a religious belief in same-sex marriage?

adam liptak

Yes. So there are two ways to look at the decision. One is that it’s a question about free speech and it applies in all kinds of settings. But I don’t know that it gets to the Supreme Court if it didn’t involve the contentious issue of same-sex marriage and the feeling among some religious people that it remains a contested and offensive concept. [MUSIC PLAYING]

sabrina tavernise

Adam, thank you.

adam liptak

Thank you, Sabrina. [MUSIC PLAYING]

sabrina tavernise

We’ll be right back. [MUSIC PLAYING] Here’s what else you should know today.

archived recording I am so disappointed with this decision, and it actually almost brings me to tears.

sabrina tavernise

On Friday, in a 6 to 3 decision, the Supreme Court struck down President Biden’s plan to cancel a portion of student loan debt for individual borrowers.

archived recording We were looking forward to the student loan forgiveness. We were actually expecting it. That’s going to crush us financially.

sabrina tavernise

As federal student loan debt has risen to more than $1.6 trillion nationwide, the plan specifically targeted lower earners, offering up to $20,000 of debt cancellation for those making less than $125,000 a year.

archived recording We can’t afford housing and groceries. Who do they think are going to pay these back? Because it’s not me.

sabrina tavernise

The court said the plan, which had not yet gone into effect, overstepped the authority of the Department of Education and required approval of Congress.

archived recording (joe biden) I know there are millions of Americans, millions of Americans in this country who feel disappointed and discouraged, or even a little bit angry about the court’s decision today on student debt. And I must admit, I do too.

sabrina tavernise

Speaking at the White House on Friday, President Biden made his displeasure with the court’s decision clear.

archived recording (joe biden) I believe the court’s decision to strike down my student debt relief program was a mistake, was wrong. I’m not going to stop fighting to deliver borrowers what they need, particularly those at the bottom end of the economic scale.

sabrina tavernise

He announced he would continue the fight for debt relief, and was directing the Secretary of Education to find new ways to ease the economic burden for borrowers.

archived recording (joe biden) Today’s decision has closed one path, now we’re going to pursue another. [MUSIC PLAYING]

sabrina tavernise
