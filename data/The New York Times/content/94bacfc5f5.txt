From “The New York Times,” I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” On Thursday night, President Biden used the final State of the Union address of his first term to make his case for a second term and to prosecute his case against Donald Trump. Today, my colleague, White House reporter Jim Tankersley, walks us through the biggest moments of the speech. It’s Friday, March 8. So Jim, good evening, and thank you for staying up with us for what I have always thought of as the Super Bowl for nerds in Washington — the State of the Union.

jim tankersley

Absolutely. Although the Super Bowl starts about three hours earlier, so it’s, in some ways, a little easier.

michael barbaro

And ends roughly around the same time.

jim tankersley

Right, roughly around the same time — and has commercials, kind of fun commercials, which we didn’t get here.

michael barbaro

No. No. So it’s kind of impossible to separate this State of the Union from the moment in which it’s being delivered, which is the start of a general election campaign for a president that has started so much faster than I think anyone had expected. In this case, the speech comes just a day after Donald Trump’s last rival drops out of the race. The Republican primary is now over, and the race for the White House is officially whittled down now to Trump versus Biden. And it’s at this moment that President Biden delivers this State of the Union. So with all that in mind, what, heading into this night, Jim, do we understand to be Biden’s mission with this speech?

jim tankersley

The timing makes this speech extraordinary, sort of, historically. I think we can overemphasize the importance of State of the Union speeches sometimes, but not this one. This is definitely one of the most important speeches Joe Biden has given as president, if not the most important thus far. And it’s important because he’s not winning this race. The polls do not show him beating Donald Trump right now. And it shows massive headwinds facing his re-election campaign. Voters do not approve of the job he’s doing as president. They think he is too old, and they do not buy what he is selling on his policy record right now. So Biden comes into this speech wanting to reset all of those. These are his goals. He wants to tell some new stories about policy, about the economy, about abortion, about foreign policy, that make him look a lot better. He wants to draw contrasts with Trump that make Biden look more likable and more preferable to Trump than voters had been thinking, coming into the speech. And maybe most importantly, he wants to dispel or at least quiet these concerns about his age by showing himself to be sort of a vigorous Joe Biden who’s up for the job.

michael barbaro

OK. With all that in mind, walk us through the speech itself and how Biden sought to navigate all of these issues and challenges he faces.

jim tankersley

It’s a really interesting start. [THREE BANGS]

archived recording 1 Joe, Joe, Joe! [CHEERING] archived recording (william mcfarland) Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States!

[cheering, applause]

jim tankersley

He kicks off with a joke. He hears all the applause and says —

archived recording (joe biden) Good evening. If I were smart, I’d go home now.

jim tankersley

And then from that moment of levity, he pivots quickly into a very serious section, when he lays out threats to democracy and freedom abroad and at home.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

archived recording (joe biden) Putin of Russia is on the march, invading Ukraine and sowing chaos throughout Europe and beyond.

jim tankersley

He starts with the war in Ukraine and with Russian President Vladimir Putin. And he talks about him and compares him, basically, to Hitler, on the march, in Europe —

archived recording (joe biden) If anybody in this room thinks Putin will stop at Ukraine, I assure you he will not.

jim tankersley

— and casts America and the Biden presidency as crucial to stopping this march. And then, he tosses in what will be a real sign of what’s to come, which is his first swipe at Donald Trump.

archived recording (joe biden) Now, my predecessor, a former Republican president, tells Putin, quote, “do whatever the hell you want.” [BOOING] That’s a quote.

jim tankersley

He quotes him and accuses him of bowing down to Putin.

archived recording (joe biden) I think it’s outrageous, it’s dangerous, and it’s unacceptable.

jim tankersley

From Russia, Biden jumps to the United States, and he’s continuing to build this case against Trump.

archived recording (joe biden) History is watching, just like history watched three years ago on January 6.

jim tankersley

Now, he starts talking about the January 6 riots at the Capitol.

archived recording (joe biden) Many of you were here on that darkest of days. We all saw with our own eyes, the insurrectionists were not patriots. They’d come to stop the peaceful transfer of power to overturn the will of the people.

jim tankersley

He calls it the greatest threat to US democracy since the Civil War.

archived recording (joe biden) This is the moment to speak the truth and to bury the lies.

jim tankersley

And he says that Trump tried to bury the truth.

archived recording (joe biden) You can’t love your country only when you win.

[cheering, applause]

jim tankersley

The subtext here is hard to miss. Biden is saying Trump is a threat to democracy in Europe and to democracy in the United States.

michael barbaro

Right. And it becomes clearer on this moment that this is going to be a State of the Union that has a lot to do with Donald Trump.

jim tankersley

Yeah. Donald Trump is like the unnamed main character in this speech. When you talk to Biden aides and his allies, they are all a little bit or a lot mystified at what they see as Americans’ sort of almost amnesia about Trump, not just the chaos of the years that Trump was president, but also the effects of his policies. They think people are sort of remembering him overly nostalgically, in a way that Biden clearly sets out in this speech to try to change. And the next way he does that, after this riff about democracy, is by talking about abortion and reproductive freedom.

archived recording (joe biden) Like most Americans, I believe Roe v. Wade got it right.

jim tankersley

He talks about how Roe v. Wade, in Biden’s view, was correctly decided, but a Supreme Court with justices appointed by Trump overturned it, which he knows Americans in the polling largely do not like.

archived recording (joe biden) He’s the reason it was overturned, and he brags about it. Look at the chaos that has resulted.

jim tankersley

And then he talks about that leading to further erosion of reproductive freedoms, including the recent Alabama decision about IVF.

archived recording (joe biden) Many of you in this chamber and my predecessor are promising to pass a national ban on reproductive freedom. My God, what freedom else would you take away?

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

jim tankersley

And there’s this sort of extraordinary moment where he turns to the members of the Supreme Court who are there at the speech — it’s not all of them, but it’s several of them — and tells them —

archived recording (joe biden) With all due respect, Justices, women are not without electoral power — excuse me, electoral or political power. You’re about to realize just how much you were right about that.

jim tankersley

Basically, hey, you’re underestimating women. You’re underestimating what you have wrought with your decision striking down Roe.

michael barbaro

Right. And it’s actually in this moment of him speaking to the justices that he becomes his most overtly, kind of, campaign-y. He actually says that in 2024, women will show their power. And in that moment, I certainly felt like this was going to be not just a State of the Union that was unusually focused on his rival, but that was unusually open in the way that it was about his presidential campaign.

jim tankersley

Yes. And then, Biden turns to the economy, where he really has sort of a big task, but also, he thinks, a big opportunity to try to change the way Americans think about Biden and Biden’s record.

archived recording (joe biden) It doesn’t make news, but in 1,000 cities and towns, the American people are writing the greatest comeback story never told.

jim tankersley

He’s sort of retelling the story of the country’s recovery from the pandemic recession and trying to cast himself, this time, not as the villain who unleashed inflation that Americans are angry about, but as the hero who has created a recovery that’s the envy of the world.

archived recording (joe biden) America’s comeback is building the future of American possibilities, building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down.

jim tankersley

And he starts telling the story, running through all the ways in which his policies helped the economy.

archived recording (joe biden) The racial wealth gap is as small as it’s been in 20 years. Wages keep going up. Inflation keeps coming down. Inflation has dropped from 9 percent to 3 percent, the lowest in the world and tending lower.

jim tankersley

And I got to tell you, Michael. I covered this stuff every day. I know this stuff really well.

michael barbaro

You do.

jim tankersley

Biden starts going so fast and sort of so animatedly, that it was hard for me to keep up.

archived recording (joe biden) And now, instead of importing foreign products and exporting American jobs, we’re exporting American products and creating American jobs.

jim tankersley

And it takes him a while to settle down and kind of relax into the speech. But in these economic parts in particular, he’s just, at times, just flying through.

michael barbaro

Well, I don’t think that was an accident. And I think it speaks to one of the things you said about what Biden’s goal was tonight, which was to be energetic. I mean, there were moments during this speech — I was listening in the same pair of headphones I’m listening to you — where I had to lower the volume and kind of take my headphones off, because Biden was almost yelling, and it felt like that was a deliberate effort by the President to say, I am so very present and here for this speech.

jim tankersley

Yeah, absolutely. And the times when he really seemed to relax into it were the times when he kind of broke character, almost, or broke from the text and needled the Republicans in the crowd.

archived recording (joe biden) 46,000 new projects have been announced all across your communities. And by the way, I noticed some of you who’ve strongly voted against it are there, cheering on that money coming in. [CHEERING]

jim tankersley

So this happens really early on. He’s talking about investments from his infrastructure law that have gone to communities all across the country, and which, as Biden loves to note, include investments that have been celebrated by some Republican members of Congress who didn’t vote for the law.

archived recording (joe biden) If any of you don’t want that money in your district, just let me know.

jim tankersley

Throughout the speech, though, especially once he settles down, Biden talks about a ton of economic policy. And it’s very strategic, what he chooses to talk about.

archived recording (joe biden) And I want to make sure that college is more affordable. Let’s continue increasing the Pell grants to working and middle-class families and increase record investments in HBCUs —

jim tankersley

He targets young voters, who Democrats are really worried about winning in large numbers in this election, by talking about his efforts to forgive student loan debt and by proposing new ways to help people who are buying homes, often for the first time. Because housing costs are a huge worry among young voters.

archived recording (joe biden) I want to provide an annual tax credit that will give Americans $400 a month for the next two years as mortgage rates come down to put toward their mortgages when they buy —

jim tankersley

Not all of his economic policy here is aimed at young voters. Some of it is much more universal. But even the universal stuff has some real appeals to young people, in a way that Joe Biden relates to them, most notably snack food.

archived recording (joe biden) You probably all saw that commercial on Snickers bars. And you get charged the same amount, and you got about, I don’t know, 10 percent fewer Snickers in it.

jim tankersley

He talks about shrinking Snickers bars as an example of corporate greed that’s pushing up prices of things — what economists call shrinkflation.

archived recording (joe biden) Same-size bag, put fewer chips in it. No, I’m not joking. It’s called shrink —

jim tankersley

And this is like a way for him to move from tangible concerns of young people into another big economic narrative he’s trying to tell, which is, Joe Biden wants to raise taxes on corporations and kind of wants to stick it to big corporations that he thinks aren’t paying their fair share. And Donald Trump — again, unnamed but very much a main character — is the guy who cut corporate taxes, and Biden is trying to paint him as sympathetic to the interests of the wealthy and big companies over the interests of working people, including young workers.

archived recording (joe biden) The working people who built this country pay more into Social Security than millionaires and billionaires do. It’s not fair! We have two ways to go. Republicans can cut Social Security and give more tax breaks to the wealthy. I will — that’s the proposal. [BOOING] Oh, no?

jim tankersley

Republicans, by the way, do not take all of these Biden narrative-reframings sitting down. They get more and more agitated and start to heckle him. It leads to this much more raucous feeling of the speech as the speech goes on. And they really start to have some back-and-forths with Biden from the lectern — none as sort of stunning as what happens when Biden starts talking about immigration.

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back. So Jim, tell us about the section of the speech where Biden broaches immigration.

jim tankersley

Well, he is trying to continue his effort to flip the script on an issue that is unquestionably difficult for him right now. And he’s trying to do it by basically casting himself as more serious about border security legislation than Republicans are.

archived recording (joe biden) In November, my team began serious negotiations with a bipartisan group of senators.

jim tankersley

He calls out House Republicans for not backing a bipartisan bill from the Senate.

archived recording (joe biden) The result was a bipartisan bill with the toughest set of border security reforms we’ve ever seen. [BOOING] Oh, you don’t think so?

jim tankersley

Republicans boo him.

archived recording (joe biden) Oh, you don’t like that bill, huh?

jim tankersley

And Biden goes right back at them. He basically says, oh, what? You don’t like this bill? Conservatives negotiated this bill.

archived recording (joe biden) I’ll be darned. That’s amazing. That bipartisan bill would hire —

jim tankersley

And then he ticks through how many more border security agents would be hired and how many more immigration judges and more asylum officers so they can resolve cases faster. He talks about how the Chamber of Commerce has endorsed the bill, and the Border Patrol Union. And Republicans are really starting to heckle him now.

archived recording (joe biden) I know you know how to read.

jim tankersley

And Biden says this one point, I know you know how to read. Like, you can read the bill. You know what’s in it. You guys negotiated it. But, he says, you’re blocking this, because it would be good for the country but bad for Trump. And hey —

archived recording (joe biden) We can fight about fixing the border, or we can fix it.

jim tankersley

I don’t think it’s about me or about Trump. I think it’s good for America.

archived recording (joe biden) Send me the border bill now!

michael barbaro

Right. And here, Biden is applying what has been, up to this point, a very pointed critique of Trump to the entire Republican Party, as a source of blind partisan opposition to practical solutions, and basically, a source of government dysfunction.

jim tankersley

Yeah. And it’s at this moment, Michael, when the speech kind of hops the track for a minute.

archived recording (joe biden) I’d be a winner — not really. archived recording (marjorie taylor greene) What about Laken Riley? archived recording (joe biden) I — [BOOING]

jim tankersley

Biden gets interrupted by Marjorie Taylor Greene. Marjorie Taylor Greene is a famously conservative, bombastic, pro-Trump Republican member of Congress from Georgia. And before the speech even starts, when Biden is walking into the House chamber, she hands him a button with a name on it, of Laken Riley, a young nursing student who was killed at the University of Georgia, allegedly by an undocumented immigrant.

michael barbaro

Right. She hands him this wearing a red MAGA, Reelect Trump hat. And she says to him as he’s walking by, “Say her name, say her name.”

jim tankersley

This has been the conservative call — “Say her name, say her name.” Joe Biden is denying, they say, violence committed by undocumented immigrants.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

jim tankersley

She starts heckling him on this point when he’s in the immigration section of his speech, and Biden indulges her.

michael barbaro

How, exactly?

jim tankersley

Biden stops his speech and has almost, like, a presidential version of a screw-it moment. He takes the pin that Marjorie Taylor Greene handed him, he looks at her, and he says the name, although he gets it wrong.

archived recording (joe biden) Lincoln — Lincoln Riley —

jim tankersley

“Lincoln Riley”—

archived recording (joe biden) — an innocent young woman who was killed by an illegal.

jim tankersley

“A young woman killed by an illegal,” which is not a phrase that Democrats usually use to talk about undocumented immigrants. And he says to her parents that his heart goes out to them. But then he goes back into his talking points about changing the dynamic at the border to make things better, and he turns it right back on Greene and her colleagues —

archived recording (joe biden) I would respectfully say — to suggest — my Republican friends — owe it to the American people. Get this bill done. We need to act now.

jim tankersley

— and says, you owe it to the American people to get this bill done.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

jim tankersley

And it’s this amazing moment.

michael barbaro

Right, what do you make of it?

jim tankersley

It was definitely off script, but I think it was strategic. Biden had success in last year’s speech baiting Republicans on Social Security. And I think he came into this speech hoping for some more successful exchanges where he could turn conservative and relatively-unpopular-across-the-country House Republicans into his foils. And here, he is trying to do that. He is strategically engaging with Marjorie Taylor Greene on her terms in order to try to make her the villain in this new story he’s telling. You’re in the way. You say you care about this, but you’re in the way.

michael barbaro

Got it. Eventually, Biden turns to yet another hot-button issue of very meaningful significance to him electorally, and that is the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

jim tankersley

This is something I think many of us had been watching for from the start of the speech. And Biden waits and is deep in the speech when he gets there. But then he drops into something we really had not seen to this point in the evening, which was kind of slow, soft, compassionate Joe Biden. And he kind of gets the room suddenly really quiet.

archived recording (joe biden) I know the last five months have been gutwrenching for so many people, for the Israeli people, for the Palestinian people.

jim tankersley

He talks about knowing how gutwrenching the time since October 7 has been for so many people, for people in Israel, for the Palestinians, for Americans. And then, he gets to the 250 hostages who were taken by Hamas in that attack.

archived recording (joe biden) I pledge to all the families that we will not rest until we bring every one of your loved ones home. We also — [APPLAUSE]

jim tankersley

By starting with the hostages, what Biden does is have a genuinely large, bipartisan outburst in the room. But then, he has to pivot.

archived recording (joe biden) Israel has the right to go after Hamas.

jim tankersley

And he pivots into his support for Israel, and then he pivots into how horrible the human conditions are in Gaza —

archived recording (joe biden) More than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed, most of whom are not Hamas.

jim tankersley

— and laments the deaths and promises more aid for the families who are homeless and hungry and without water.

archived recording (joe biden) The only real solution to the situation is a two-state solution over time. [APPLAUSE]

jim tankersley

And then, in the very end, he pivots back to an admonition, almost, of the Israeli government, which has rejected Biden’s preferred end to this entire thing, which is a two-state solution.

michael barbaro

Right. And in all those pivots, Jim, it feels like you can see a president and a candidate for president who is visibly struggling to figure out how to manage all the constituencies in this conflict.

jim tankersley

Yeah, the way I would put it is that you see a president who does not have a magic solution that can make everyone happy and that also comports with his values.

michael barbaro

Right.

jim tankersley

And you see him trying to be responsive to changing facts in the conflict but not coming anywhere close to changing as fast as many of his critics would want him to.

michael barbaro

Finally, Biden turns to the elephant in the room, arguably, the trickiest subject of all, which is his age and physical and mental readiness to be a second-term president.

jim tankersley

Yeah, listen. If you cover the White House, even if you write mostly about policy, you’ve been lectured by people in the White House about how the media writes way too much about Biden’s age. But at the same time, the White House is acutely aware of how much of a problem Biden’s age is for him in the polls. And this speech turns out in the end to be a direct acknowledgment of that and an attempt, just like with so many other things, to change the narrative.

michael barbaro

Mm-hmm.

archived recording (joe biden) I know it may not look like it, but I’ve been around a while.

jim tankersley

Biden takes the age issue head on.

archived recording (joe biden) When they get to be my age, certain things become clearer than ever. I know the American story.

jim tankersley

And then he tries, in sort of Ronald Reagan-esque fashion, to make his age into a good thing, an experience thing.

archived recording (joe biden) My lifetime has taught me to embrace freedom and democracy, a future based on core values that defined America — honesty, decency, dignity, equality, to respect everyone, to give everyone a fair shot, to give hate, no safe harbor.

jim tankersley

And here is where he tries to use his age and his story to relate back to the narratives he’s trying to tell about policy and the country right now. And he ends by trying to contrast himself in advancing age with Trump in advancing age.

archived recording (joe biden) My fellow Americans. archived recording 2 Four more years! Four more years! archived recording (joe biden) The issue facing our nation isn’t how old we are. It’s how old are our ideas. Hate, anger, revenge, retribution are the oldest of ideas. But you can’t lead America with ancient ideas that only take us back.

jim tankersley

This is like a total critique of Trump. He is saying, Trump is like a cranky old man, shouting that he wants things to go back to a way that they were and about all the people he’s angry at, and that Biden is trying to be this optimist who wants to take us forward and unite the country.

archived recording (joe biden) You’re the reason we’ve never been more optimistic about our future than I am now. So let’s build the future together. Let’s remember who we are. We are the United States of America!

[cheering, applause]

And there is nothing, nothing beyond our capacity when we act together. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

michael barbaro

In the end, was this an effective speech, given all the burdens and challenges that you outlined at the beginning of our conversation? Did President Biden rise to the occasion, and will it ultimately matter?

jim tankersley

Well, we’ll have to see what the polls show. But I think two things are important here right away. One is that in the time from when the speech ended until we started taking this episode, I heard from a bunch of Democrats who had been skeptical about the President’s ability to deliver a speech with this level of energy, who were thrilled with it. And I think, on that, he’s done an important part of his job, which is to reassure some parts of his coalition, right? But also, there is this rather extraordinary ad that a group of Trump supporters aired earlier in the day that basically went straight at Biden on his age. It was a caricature of a caricature of an old, weak man, unable to get up the stairs, let alone do the job, and implied that he wasn’t going to be able to finish out a second term, like, live through it. That is a low bar to clear, obviously, for a guy giving a speech to a joint session of Congress. But that’s clearly not the guy who showed up at the State of the Union. That is not the guy giving the speech. He coughed. He stumbled. He had some Joe Biden-isms that happened. But he was not an old, frail man who couldn’t walk. He basically closed the place down. He hung around, talking to members of Congress long after most of the networks had turned off their cameras. And he loved it. He was having a good time. And he was trying really hard to show the world that, hey, that caricature you saw of me is nothing like reality. With all that said, it’s almost impossible to reset narratives and change the way people view things in the span of one speech, whether that’s your performance on the economy or your fitness for office. And so now, we’re going to see, in the span of an actual campaign over the next several months — a campaign that started in earnest this week — whether Biden can do this again and again and again, whether he can have the repetition and a repeat performance that he needs to convince voters that, hey, these narratives, you should rethink them. You should rethink me, and you should rethink my record, and you should give me another chance and reelect me.

michael barbaro

Well, Jim, thank you very much. I appreciate it.

jim tankersley

Thank you, Michael.
