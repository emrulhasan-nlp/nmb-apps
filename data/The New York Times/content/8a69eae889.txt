Re “Trump Continues to Roll With Win in New Hampshire” (front page, Jan. 24):

I thought for a fleeting moment Tuesday night when the New Hampshire Republican primary results began to come in that those among us who are disgusted by the thought of a candidate who gives the appearance of a modern-style fascist, praises the likes of Viktor Orban and now is even losing grip on his mental acuity might be joined by major factions of the Republican Party.

But with the primary over, it appears that this is not true. Donald Trump made gains even among suburban Republicans. This appears to be who the party is now and who they want to represent them.

The soul of American democracy has never been in so much jeopardy, and those of us who want to save it have our work cut out for us.

The takeaway from the New Hampshire primary is not that Nikki Haley can’t win the Republican nomination. We knew that already, as well as that the Republican Party has been hijacked by Donald Trump and his MAGA supporters, with G.O.P. moderates temporarily, if not permanently, sidelined.
