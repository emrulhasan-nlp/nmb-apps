Paul Krugman I am an Opinion columnist for The New York Times.

What I Cover

Most of my writing involves economics, but I weigh in on other issues such as technology, global politics or domestic policy, when I think I can add something to the discussion. I also write a weekly newsletter.

My Background

I’m an economist by training, with an original focus on international trade and finance, who taught at M.I.T. and Princeton University among other places, and am now a distinguished professor at City University of New York Graduate Center.

My pre-Times research was honored, among other things, with the 2008 Nobel Prize in economics. I am the author (or editor) of 27 books, and I am one of the founders of the “new trade theory,” a major rethinking of international trade that explains the emergence of new trade patterns between countries, based, in part, on how consumers started to seek out different brands for everyday products. I received my undergraduate degree at Yale University and my Ph.D. in economics from M.I.T. I grew up in Albany, N.Y.

Journalistic Ethics

I rely almost entirely on public information, rather than insider access. I try to get my facts right, try to listen to multiple views, and make a point of admitting when I got something wrong. I have no financial stake in anything I write, and no connection with any political campaign. You can learn more about The Times’s ethics guidelines here.

Best to go through The Times secure tip line. Everything else gets spammed.
