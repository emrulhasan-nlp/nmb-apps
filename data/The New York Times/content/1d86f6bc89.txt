What happens when Caitlin Clark comes to town?

Everyone else does, too.

The Big Ten women’s basketball tournament, which starts Wednesday in Minneapolis, has sold out for the first time, at least in part thanks to Clark, the star point guard for Iowa and the new record-holder for career scoring in Division I.

Clark began her college career playing in front of empty stands in 2020 during the pandemic. This season, she’s a national sensation, filling arenas from Iowa to Wisconsin to Maryland and drawing unprecedented attention to women’s college basketball.

One way to gauge her popularity is by looking at changes in attendance at the colleges that have hosted Iowa.
