When I was in sixth grade, I made a decision that changed the course of my life. I decided not to try out for the middle school swim team. I know that might not sound like a big deal, but it was. As a grade schooler I was a standout swimmer — strong shoulders and back, and well-muscled legs that powered me through the water with ease and speed. I was disciplined, obsessive. My form was excellent. My coach saw potential.

Had I stuck with it, my life might have turned out pretty different. I might have been a popular jock rather than a lonely weirdo. I might have become a varsity athlete who won admission to a top college rather than a barely graduated teenager who had to take remedial math at a community college to scrape my way into a not-very-competitive school.

I have been thinking about this decision a lot lately, because many of us have been forced, regardless of whether we want to, to think about children and the decisions we allow them to make, and what it might mean for them to regret those decisions. I am speaking, of course, about the ongoing war over transgender and gender-nonconforming children.

For people on the right who oppose gender transition at any age, the argument is simple: There are two genders, and people who think they are a different sex or gender than the one they were assigned at birth are delusional; indulging that delusion is wrong. Biological reality requires all people to simply live with the gender associated with their birth sex. (Unless they are intersex, in which case it is evidently OK for parents and doctors to decide and surgically alter a child’s body to conform with that decision without the child’s consent or even knowledge.)
