Life expectancy is one of the oldest and surest indicators we have of both human suffering and human progress. Wars, famines, the 1918 flu, vaccines, pasteurization, rising crop yields — so many events over time are encoded in the line of life expectancy, but its overall astonishing ascent is among the best cases for 20th-century humankind that can be made.

I have been staring for months at a graph of life expectancy for Black and white Americans from 1900 to 2017. It tells a story of persistent, if uneven, progress in closing the gap between these groups; it began to reach a promising convergence in the 2010s. Then, the Covid pandemic began. Life expectancy plunged, and graphs of its decline started going viral. Decades of progress in extending human lives have been reversed. Life expectancy for Black and white Americans has diverged again, falling back to where it was in 1995. A gap of nearly five years of expected life now separates us.

For Black Americans, this pattern — years of progress achieved and then erased — is common enough that the idea of racial progress in the U.S. is sometimes called a myth. Many of the indicators we use to track human advancement are particularly stuck for Black Americans, or are moving in the wrong direction. Our diminished life expectancy is not only the product of losing many older Americans to the pandemic but also the consequence of maternal mortality, of children’s deaths from gunshots and of car crashes, all of which disproportionately affect Black people. But a striking narrative of Black progress once captivated the world’s attention.
