A teacher in an Atlanta suburb has been fired for reading a book to fifth-grade students that explores gender roles and identity through the eyes of a child who describes their shadow as purple, her lawyer said on Friday.

The Cobb County Board of Education voted 4-3 on Thursday to approve the recommendation by the superintendent, Chris Ragsdale, to terminate the contract of the teacher, Katherine Rinderle, according to a recording of the meeting.

“The district is pleased that this difficult issue has concluded; we are very serious about keeping our classrooms focused on teaching, learning, and opportunities for success for students,” the Cobb County School District said in a statement on Friday.

The statement said, “The Board’s decision is reflective of that mission.”

Ms. Rinderle, 33, was a teacher at Due West Elementary School in Marietta, Ga., which is northwest of Atlanta.
