Former President Donald J. Trump, who for months has expressed openness to retaliating against his political enemies if he returns to the White House and has vowed to have federal prosecutors investigate them, downplayed his interest in pursuing retribution at a televised town hall on Wednesday.

“I’m not going to have time for retribution,” Mr. Trump said at a Fox News town hall in Iowa. “We’re going to make this country so successful again. I’m not going to have time for retribution.”

Yet even as Mr. Trump seemingly shifted his stance on seeking political revenge, he did not dismiss the possibility outright, suggesting that many in the country would support his past remarks given how Democrats had behaved while he was in office.

“Well, first of all, a lot of people would say that that’s not so bad,” Mr. Trump said, referring to the idea of seeking retribution. “Look what they did.”
