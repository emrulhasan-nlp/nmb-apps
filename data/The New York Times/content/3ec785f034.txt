The Numbers: New York City women stop gaining ground.

Sixty years after a federal law mandated equal pay for equal work, women who live in New York City, one of the world’s leading economic hubs, still earn less than men across all occupations, from lawyers and accountants to child care workers.

In 2022, women in the city earned 90 cents for every $1 earned by men in the city, according to a study by the Center for New York City Affairs at The New School and Women Creating Change, a nonprofit organization.

While that was still better than how women fared nationally last year, when they earned 87 cents for every $1 earned by men, the gender pay gap in the city has not changed since 2007.

Since 1997, women’s pay in the city has actually declined slightly, by 2 cents against men’s pay, even as women’s pay nationally has risen by 6 cents over the same period. At the same time, New York State mirrored national trends, with the earnings ratio for women climbing to 88 cents for every $1 men earned, up from 83 cents.

“Women don’t make more than men in any occupation that I could find,” Lina Moe, the lead author of the study, said in an interview.

What Is Driving Pay Inequities: More low-paying jobs for women and higher-paying jobs for men.

The lack of progress in closing the city’s gender pay gap is partly the result of recent job trends. There has been rapid growth in low-paying jobs that are held mostly by women, such as home health aides and child care and social service workers. At the same time, there has been an increase in high-paying jobs in technology, finance and other industries that have been typically dominated by men.
