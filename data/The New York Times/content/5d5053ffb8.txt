This article is from a special report on the Athens Democracy Forum, which gathered experts last week in the Greek capital to discuss global issues.

Do we dare to hope? This was the question addressed to the 11th Athens Democracy Forum, against a backdrop of war in Europe, unchecked climate change, galloping inflation and the A.I. revolution with its specter of “robots with glaring red eyes,” as Nick Clegg, the president of global affairs for Meta, put it.

Mr. Clegg dismissed those sinister visions — A.I. can slice and dice vast amounts of data, he pointed out, and is adept at pattern recognition but does not even know the meaning of the words it uses. Fear has always accompanied the arrival of new technologies, but the worst is far from inevitable.

The Greek economy has surged from the desperate state it was in a decade ago. The weather was overcast and cool, with no hint of the climate extremes Greece has experienced of late. The war in Ukraine drags on and takes a terrible toll, but the front lines have scarcely moved in a year. Perhaps attendees of the forum could be forgiven for feeling intimations of imminent global cataclysm are overblown.

Still, there was no consensus on hope. Democracy has taken a beating in recent years with the rise of autocratic states and attacks around the world on a free press and independent judiciaries. Democratic societies have suffered from self-satisfied blindness to their eternal fragility and from acceptance of forms of injustice — especially growing inequality — that undermine consensus. Even the claim of democracy to the moral high ground is now questioned, a theme that was consistently aired in Athens.
