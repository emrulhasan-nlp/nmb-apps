The panel that will hear arguments over Donald. J. Trump’s claim that he is immune from prosecution in the election subversion case includes a Republican appointee who is no stranger to cases involving the former president, along with two fairly recent Democratic appointees.

Judge Karen L. Henderson, a graduate of the University of North Carolina law school, joined the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1990. Nominated by President George H.W. Bush, she is one of the few Republican appointees. In other cases involving Mr. Trump, she has generally been more willing than many of her colleagues to rule in ways favorable to him.

In November 2019, Judge Henderson was in the dissent of an 8-3 ruling by the full appeals court that Mr. Trump’s accounting firm must turn over eight years of his financial records to Congress. She was also part of a panel that ruled in February 2020 that Mr. Trump’s former White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, was immune from being subpoenaed to testify before the House; several months later, the full court reversed that decision.

And in June 2020, Judge Henderson was part of a panel that ordered a district court judge to immediately dismiss a case against Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn. That would have blocked the district court judge’s plan to scrutinize the circumstances by which the Trump-era Justice Department sought dismissal of the case even though Mr. Flynn had pleaded guilty. The full appeals court reversed that decision over her objections, too.
