Three groundbreaking Black portraiture artists have exhibitions this fall at university art museums, two of which are Ivy League schools — historically white spaces with pasts that are entangled with slavery.

The shows speak to the evolution of art institutions as they confront calls to diversify, which began in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020 when museums nationwide were charged with racism and discriminatory practices.

Lauren Haynes, director of curatorial affairs and programs at the Queens Museum in New York City, and co-curator of one of the three university exhibitions, said she hopes these are part of a sustained effort by museums of all sizes to create exhibitions and collections that reflect their communities and the larger world in which they exist.

Yale University’s history includes the use of enslaved African labor and faculty members who led the American Eugenics movement of the 1920s and 1930s. The first nine presidents of Princeton University owned enslaved people, and a slave auction took place on campus in 1766. Duke University’s history is entwined with slavery, post-Emancipation segregation and white supremacy. In 2018, the university’s trustees voted to change the name of a building honoring an early benefactor of the school, Julian Carr, who was a white supremacist and Ku Klux Klan member.
