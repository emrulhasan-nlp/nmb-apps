This week, The Financial Times featured an interview with the Finnish demographer Anna Rotkirch, discussing one of the more striking subplots in the widening drama of demographic decline: The sudden collapse of what had heretofore been seen as a pronatalist success story in the social democracies of northern Europe.

Up until recently, countries like Finland, Sweden and Norway had notably higher fertility rates than many countries in southern Europe, and the Nordic socioeconomic model, with its mixture of gender egalitarianism and strong welfare-state supports for child rearing, was often held up as proof that progressive policies could prop up birthrates, even that feminism is the new natalism. The hope was that extremely low birthrates in more conservative countries like Italy (or for that matter South Korea) might be part of a transition through an unworkable mixture of modern economic demands and traditional expectations for women — with Scandinavia showing that a more progressive, feminist and family-friendly destination was waiting on the other side.

That hope seems to be dissolving. As Darel Paul wrote in an essay for Compact magazine last week, Europe has suffered a “stunning fertility collapse” in the last decade, much of it concentrated in countries where the feminist egalitarian model was strongest. Finland is one of them: As The Financial Times notes, “despite all the support offered to parents,” the country’s birthrate “has fallen nearly a third since 2010,” and its birthrate is now barely above the lows of Italy.

I’ve been writing about pro-family policy for basically my entire career, and I’ve always assumed that America could learn something from the European experience — not that the Nordic model in particular is necessarily ideal, but at least that policy can shape fertility decisions and work against anti-natal trends. And I still think that: I’m very happy, for instance, that the House just passed a child tax credit expansion, because in an age of declining birthrates, every little bit helps.
