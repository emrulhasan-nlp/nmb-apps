The authorities in Kansas are searching for the vandals who stole a life-size bronze statue commemorating Jackie Robinson, the first Black Major League Baseball player of the modern era, after they cut it off at the ankles, leaving behind just the statue’s shoes and base.

The police in Wichita were notified of the theft around 12:50 p.m. on Thursday after getting a call from League 42, the Little League nonprofit that installed the statue in McAdams Park, Andrew Ford, a police spokesman, said on Saturday.

He estimated that the statue weighed at least 100 pounds.

“I don’t know what the motivation is,” Mr. Ford said. “All considerations are being looked into.”
