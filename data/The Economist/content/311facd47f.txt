H E WAS JUST an ordinary fellow. Nothing remarkable about him. He was Everyman, every Russian; one of the hundreds of thousands whose voices were usually stifled. His speeches weren’t full of literary quotes or references to history. Instead he liked to sit down with people and talk about what worried them: health care, schools, the price of bread. He was no philosopher, just a jobbing lawyer, turned obsessive blogger, turned leading opponent of Vladimir Putin and his regime of crooks and thieves. He resisted everything they stood for: cronyism, greed, moral rot. For that he knew he would be endlessly harassed, imprisoned and silenced. Killed, possibly. But Alexei Navalny was not afraid of death. He often talked as if he had died already, and got over it.

He almost had. In August 2020, on a campaign flight in Siberia, his clothes were smeared with Novichok, a nerve agent developed for the Russian army. The regional hospital was unsafe for him, so he was flown to Berlin. When, after five months, he recovered and flew home, he was immediately arrested and sent to jail on ludicrous charges. But he got his revenge on “Vladimir the Poisoner of Underpants”. Two days after his arrest his team released a two-hour film of Putin’s secret palace on the Black Sea, with its helipads, gold loo-brushes and pole-dancing stage. No need for a speech about it. The film said it all.
