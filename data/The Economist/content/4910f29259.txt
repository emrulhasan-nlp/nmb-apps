Lunatics” is a comic novel published in 2012 by two American authors, Dave Barry and Alan Zweibel. The men wrote alternate chapters, making each more preposterous than the last. It starts with two suburban dads disagreeing over an offside call at a schoolgirls’ soccer game. Before long the dads have inadvertently hijacked a cruise ship full of nudists and overthrown the governments of more than one country. It is not until chapter 52 that Donald Trump tries to become president of the United States.

Twelve years ago “we both thought that was hilarious,” said Barry. He is the first to admit that, like many book-smart people, he underestimated his fellow Florida resident. Barry has spent nearly four decades poking gentle fun at the wackiness of the Sunshine State – the only place in America where mermaid impersonators are state employees (at Weeki Wachee Springs in Hernando County, if you’re wondering). But he never expected one of his punchlines to become the most powerful man in the world.
