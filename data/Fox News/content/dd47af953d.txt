Israeli drone strikes aluminum plant in southern Lebanon, state-run media says

Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported that an Israeli drone fired two missiles at an aluminum plant in the southern town of Nabatiyeh early Saturday.

The drone strikes caused fire and widespread damage, though there were no reports of casualties, according to the Associated Press.

The alleged Israeli strike strike near the village of Toul is the first to hit the area since the 34-day war in 2006 between Israel and Lebanonâ€™s militant Hezbollah group, and far from the border.

Hezbollah members prevented journalists who attempted to reach the factory, the AP reported.

There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the strike at the factory but it did say that the Israeli army is currently striking Hezbollah targets. It said further details will follow.

Following the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks on Israel by the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas, in which 1,200 Israelis were brutally killed, Hezbollah started attacks on Israeli posts along the northern border. Israel has responded with mortar shells and airstrikes on Hezbollah targets in Lebanese territory.

The terror group has claimed responsibility for more than a dozen attacks on Israeli posts, including one with two suicide drones on a post in the northern Israeli town of Metula.

Hezbollah has an estimated 150,000 rockets and missiles which would be directed at Israel should the terror group fully enter the war.
