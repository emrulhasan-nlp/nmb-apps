'Horror show': Trump blasts Biden's border policies ahead of State of the Union

Former President Trump blasted President Biden ahead of his State of the Union address Thursday night, posting a video to X, formerly known as Twitter.

“Joe Biden is on the run from his record and lying like crazy to try to escape accountability for the horrific devastation he and his party have created-- all the while, they continue the very policies that are causing this horror show to go,” Trump said in the video. “We cannot take it any longer as a country.”

Trump said Biden’s speech Thursday night will be a "sad excuse for a State of the Union address."

The 2024 GOP frontrunner and presumptive nominee said that when he left office, he left Biden with most secure border in United States history.

“We gave him Remain in Mexico, very tough to get but I got it....an asylum ban, title 42, 571 miles of border wall, rapid deportations and much more," Trump said. "Safest border in the history of our country. As soon as he got in, Crooked Joe, and his radical left lunatics deliberately dismantled each and every one of those polices that were so good."

"What's happened now is a horror show—the country, our country, is being laughed at all over the world," Trump said. "Biden has actively aided and abetted the importation of millions and millions of illegal alien migrants and resettled them into your communities."

Trump blasted "Crooked" as the "most incompetent president we’ve ever had."

"He is keeping the hoards of illegal migrants and illegal aliens pouring into the country," he said, adding that many illegal migrants come from "mental institutions and prisons."

"The very first bill Joe Biden sent to Congress was a plan to turn illegal aliens into voting citizens," Trump said, adding sarcastically: "that’s just what we need."

Trump also blasted Biden's economic policies, and declared:

"It is time to tell Crooked Joe Biden: You’re fired."
